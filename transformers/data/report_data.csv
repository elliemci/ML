"We believe that well-designed products have lower environmental footprint. This is a principle we strive to bring to everything we create, and a central pillar of our 2030 goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our entire product life cycle. "
"Our energy efficiency goals extend well beyond our products. We’re focused on using less energy across our operations, beginning with how we design, operate, and maintain our facilities. And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain, which benefits those living in areas where our suppliers operate."
"Last year, one of our manufacturers in Guangzhou, China, deployed a state-of-the-art energy management system. With the system in place, the manufacturer can monitor and optimize their complex network of air conditioners, fans, pumps, and air compressors at the facility."
"We’re at a pivotal moment in addressing climate change. Renewable energy is poised to replace fossil fuels as the future of electricity. Its adoption means healthier air, stronger local economies, and lower carbon emissions. All at cost-competitive rates. "
"Our goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 requires more than reducing emissions. Toddress the emissions we can’t avoid for the foreseeable future, we need to take active steps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is a necessary complement to our emissions reduction efforts—and an essential pillar of our strategy."
"In Kilifi, Kenya, just south of the Arabuko Sokoke National Reserve, a forestry business  is seeking to change the way commercial forestry operates in this region of Africa. "
"Our responsibility for our products begins with the design process and carries through end-of-life. While we first look for opportunities for reuse, a product or part that no longer functions as intended can still be a source of valuable materials."
"We’re working toward waste-free operations, where we rely on recyclable or reusable materials and send nothing to landfill."
"The buildings where we meet and create—retail stores, data centers, offices—are key to preserving the creativity and collaboration unique to Apple. Our shared spaces inspire innovation. They also reflect our values. It’s our duty to examine the impact each of our buildings has on the environment."
