Responsible Business Practices  Corporate governance Compliance and ethics Supply chain management Supplier diversity Data privacy and security Responsible use of artificial intelligence  and machine learning Public policy At UnitedHealth Group, we believe a healthy  population is at the very heart of the idea  of sustainability in our society. The more  than 350,000 people across Optum and  UnitedHealthcare are committed to furthering  our mission to help people live healthier lives  and to help make the health system work better  for everyone. Given our reach and resources – and the  millions of people we touch each day – we feel  a deep sense of responsibility to chart a more  sustainable path forward, helping to build a  modern, high-performing health system that  improves access, affordability, outcomes and  experiences for people who depend on it. That’s  what makes a health care system sustainable,  and it is embedded in our mission and  throughout our business strategy. This report, told through the stories of our  colleagues and partners – in their own words,  work and deeds – is our way of sharing  our progress. It is a story of partnership,  collaboration and investment seeking to   improve the experiences of those who rely   on the health system. It is also a story of humility, as there is so much  more work left to do. But as you will see in  the pages of this report, my colleagues find a  profound sense of purpose and inspiration in  this work. We approach these challenges with  determination, intensity and focus – setting  clear, measurable goals and objectives, raising  the bar at every point of progress and holding  ourselves accountable when we fall short. To drive greater alignment and coordination  across our enterprise efforts, in February we  appointed Patricia L. Lewis to serve as our  first chief sustainability officer and lead this  important work. The goals, actions and initiatives outlined in this  report are bold ambitions. But bold ambitions  are what these challenges require – and that is  what inspires my colleagues to carry this work  forward every day. Underpinning all our efforts are strong  governance practices. UnitedHealth Group  has a long-standing history of board diversity  and independence and of championing ethics,  compliance and equitable workplace policies. We now have newly expanded board oversight  for ESG, including our corporate citizenship  activities and the environmental and climate  change initiatives described in this report. In the following pages, you’ll see evidence of  our progress and of our ambition. You’ll see  enhanced transparency, clear commitments  and measurable goals. You’ll see how far we’ve  come and where we have yet to go. Despite the many challenges we face as a  society, what gives me great confidence and  hope is the phenomenal talent, expertise and  steadfast commitment to our mission I see in  our team every day. We touch virtually every  aspect of the health system. We understand  what an extraordinary privilege it is for a person  to entrust us with their care. We are in this to  help people – our families and yours – for today  and far into the future. As one of the world’s leading health care  organizations, we understand the responsibility  we have to our stakeholders and the people  we serve to uphold and advance every facet of  our sustainability strategy. It is integral to our  mission and inextricably linked with our priorities  for long-term growth. We see our company, together with a broad  spectrum of partners, as well positioned to help  advance health equity. We believe every person  deserves the opportunity to live their healthiest  life – and we are determined to do our part to  break down barriers, whether social, economic,  environmental or otherwise, wherever they exist. This means closing gaps in care and connecting  patients and members to the resources and  support they need to stay healthy. It means  addressing the social determinants of health –  connecting individual people to critical   resources and working at the community level   to help solve systemic challenges. It means  building a robust, capable and compassionate  health workforce as diverse as the communities  we’re fortunate to serve. We must also be conscious and judicious   about the resources we use and continually  refine our processes and operations to reduce  the footprint we leave behind. Once again, the  beneficiaries of thoughtful resource stewardship  especially include those who are already  marginalized, in particular poor communities   and communities of color. Our approach to sustainability  reflects our belief that the  health of any society can be  measured only by the health  and well-being of its people. • Reach operational net-zero   by 2035. • Achieve a 60% reduction in  scope 1 and scope 2 emissions  by 2030. • Commit to the Science Based  Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-  Zero Standard. • Invest and source 100% of our  global electricity demand with  renewable sources by 2030. 55%+ of our outpatient surgeries  and radiology services will be  delivered at high-quality, cost- efficient sites of care by 2030.

UnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company  with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help  make the health system work better for everyone. We are 350,000 colleagues in two distinct and  complementary businesses working to help build a modern,  high-performing health system through improved access,  affordability, outcomes and experiences. Optum delivers care aided by technology and data,  empowering people, partners and providers with the  guidance and tools they need to achieve better health. Compassion  Walk in the shoes of the people we serve   and those with whom we work. UnitedHealthcare offers a full range of health benefits,  enabling affordable coverage, simplifying the health care  experience and delivering access to high-quality care. We work with governments, employers, partners and  providers to care for 147 million people and share a vision  of a value-based system that provides compassionate and  equitable care. At UnitedHealth Group, our mission calls us, our values guide us  and our culture connects us as we seek to improve care for the  consumers we are privileged to serve and their communities. • The top-ranked company in the insurance and managed care  sector on Fortune’s 2022 World’s Most Admired Companies  list for the 12th consecutive year. • Ranked as one of America’s most community-minded  companies for the 10th consecutive year in 2021 by the Civic  50 and named the leader in the Healthcare Sector category. • Named one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality by  the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality  Index 2022, with a perfect score of 100. • Recognized with the 2021 Brillante Award for Corporate  Excellence by Prospanica for outstanding contributions to   the educational, economic and social well-being of the  Hispanic community. • Named one of the best places to work for disability inclusion  in 2021 by the Disability Equality Index®. • Ranked 4th in the nation on the 2022 Military Friendly®  Employers list and also as a Top Ten 2022 Military Spouse  Friendly® Employer. Value-Based, Comprehensive   Care Delivery   With more than 60,000 employed   or aligned physicians serving nearly   20 million patients and more than   100 payer partners, UnitedHealth Group’s  care delivery business is strongly  positioned to help providers and payers  transition from fee-for-service to value- oriented models designed to achieve  higher-quality outcomes at lower cost. We continue to integrate our capabilities  across our clinical, in-home and  virtual assets, strengthening physician  incentives across our care models. Health Benefits   As the market leader in health benefits,  UnitedHealthcare serves more than   50 million people across its commercial  and government programs. We  continue to prioritize making coverage  more affordable, simplifying the  member experience and incentivizing  high-quality, supported care. We’re  expanding provider relationships that  reward value and provide a human  touch, while investing in areas like  affordable housing and food security  to help address factors that play a vital  role in a person’s health but fall outside  the clinical setting. Health Technology   We believe we can play a vital role in  using clinical data and intelligence  to help redesign, automate and  deploy new technologies to simplify  administrative processes and clinical  decision-making. This enables  physicians and health systems to  operate more efficiently and effectively,  and to better serve their patients. As a payer, provider and technology  company, we are uniquely positioned to  bring greater transparency and quality  to the marketplace. Health Financial Services   Streamlining payment processes  for consumers and providers is a  fundamental aspect of a modern health  system. We believe integrating the end- to-end health banking and payments  experience will help providers get  paid more accurately, faster and with  less administrative burden, making  payments simpler, more convenient  and affordable for consumers. Pharmacy Services  As the most common touch point in  health care, pharmacy care services are  vital to improving patient outcomes and  reducing total cost of care throughout  the health system. We continue to  innovate as one of the industry’s  largest pharmacy benefit managers,  strengthening our direct-to-consumer  offerings and seamlessly integrating  our medical, pharmacy, behavioral and  community health capabilities. Sustainability is an integral  part of our business  strategy, culture and mission  as we work to ensure the  health care system works  better for everyone — both  now and in the future. Our approach to sustainability reflects our   belief that the health of any society can be  measured only by the health and well-being   of its people. Informed by our stakeholders, our sustainability  priority areas reflect our commitment to providing  distinct value to those we are privileged to serve,  and to society more broadly. Our five strategic  growth priorities — value-based, comprehensive  care delivery; health benefits; health technology;  health financial services; pharmacy services —  reflect the ways in which we see our business  objectives and mission working in tandem to  support a healthier society. Environmental Health  We recognize the important role the environment  plays in the health of every community, and we  are committed to mitigating our impact on the  environment by setting a science-based target to  reduce emissions, reducing our paper usage and  leading systemic change to decarbonize the health  care industry. Helping to Build a Modern,   High-Performing Health System  We are committed to a future that expands access  to care, improves health care affordability, enhances  the health care experience and achieves better  health outcomes for everyone. Our partnerships  with key, localized stakeholders are helping us build  healthier communities across the U.S.  
Our People and Culture  We celebrate our people, ideas and experiences,  creating a culture where all team members are  appreciated, valued and able to reach their full  potential. We join together as individuals —  forming a team as diverse as the people we   serve — in meeting our responsibility to improve  the health system and building the health  workforce with a diverse pipeline of talent. Responsible Business Practices  For more than 40 years, we’ve developed strong  and effective governance practices through  compliance, board diversity and independence,  a commitment to ethics and integrity, and an  emphasis on data security and supply chain  management. UnitedHealth Group has a long-  standing commitment to sustainability  supported by our senior leaders and  Board of Directors. As part of its ongoing oversight, the  board reviewed committee charters  and made several changes in 2021,  including assigning oversight for the  company’s environmental, social  and governance (ESG) agenda to the  Governance Committee and having  other committees oversee specific ESG  elements within their purview. The Governance Committee is  responsible for providing oversight of  ESG policies and practices, including  identifying key ESG topics, ensuring  appropriate board or committee  oversight of those topics, overseeing  the company’s environmental and  climate change initiatives and  corporate citizenship activities,  and reviewing the company’s ESG  sustainability reports. The Audit and Finance Committee  oversees management’s processes to  identify ESG investment criteria and to  ensure the accuracy of key disclosures  related to ESG matters. The committee  also oversees our Compliance and  Ethics program. The Compensation and Human  Resources Committee reviews the  company’s strategies, programs and  outcomes related to human capital  management, as well as diversity,  equity and inclusion. Committee, to better reflect its  expanded oversight of clinical care and  practice matters and access to care, in  addition to health policy matters. The  Health and Clinical Practice Policies  Committee oversees management’s  efforts and initiatives to expand access  to health care; improve health care  affordability; advance clinical care  and safety; enhance the health care  experience; achieve better health  outcomes; advance health equity; and  reduce health disparities. To support our growing focus on  sustainability, the company created  the role of chief sustainability officer,  responsible for developing and  implementing a comprehensive ESG  strategy; establishing annual and long- term sustainability goals, performance  metrics and a governance structure to  achieve them; and helping to shape our  ESG agenda. The chief sustainability officer,  appointed in 2022, is assisted in  overseeing our day-to-day sustainability  agenda through close partnerships with  a wide range of leaders across Optum,  UnitedHealthcare, Operations and  Facilities Management, Sourcing and  Procurement, Clinical, Human Capital,  Finance, Compliance and Privacy, Legal  and Risk Management, Compliance and  Regulatory Affairs, Communications,  and Enterprise Resiliency and Response. Additionally, in 2022, we plan to  establish a cross-enterprise steering  committee composed of senior- level leaders and key internal  stakeholders who will be responsible  for collaborating and executing on all  aspects of the enterprise ESG strategy. We proactively engage our stakeholders in continuous dialogue regarding our business and sustainability efforts. In 2021, we  continued to embrace a broad and proactive engagement process with stakeholders, holding more one-on-one discussions and  applying feedback in our ongoing efforts. We solicit input from a diverse group of stakeholders through a variety of formal and  informal methods, including forums, surveys and individual meetings. Each stakeholder’s unique perspective informs our priority sustainability topics and ongoing approach to sustainability. We will  continue to take an intentional approach to stakeholder engagement efforts and take action on the feedback we receive. Consumers  We conducted a comprehensive online survey to learn more  about the ESG issues most important to our consumers. Employees  We encouraged employees to participate in three formal  surveys in which they shared opportunities to improve their  work experience. Customers and Health Care Professionals  We invited key customers to participate in one-on-one  meetings with UnitedHealth Group leaders to better  understand how we can work together more effectively. Peer Companies  We collaborate with peers through the National Academy   of Medicine to better understand priorities for the health   care industry. Shareholders  In addition to our annual report, shareholders meeting and annual  investor outreach, we regularly communicated with investors  regarding financial performance and ESG issues. We engaged  deeply with our investors to ensure we are driving long-term value. Community-Based Partners  We engaged with community-based partners on a regular   basis through one-on-one meetings with key partners,   grant-making and volunteer efforts. Assessing our sustainability priority issues is a continuous process informed by ongoing engagement with our stakeholders. We understand stakeholder priorities may evolve over time, and in 2021 we strengthened our processes to understand their  perspectives on an ongoing basis. Please see page 14 for a full discussion of our stakeholder engagement. Although the priorities of each stakeholder may vary, there is a common expectation that UnitedHealth Group has the  responsibility and capabilities to address the most pressing challenges facing the health care system. We focus our work and  report on the following topics. Helping to Build a Modern,   High-Performing Health System • Health Equity  • Expanding Access to Care • Improving Health Care Affordability • Enhancing the Health Care Experience • Achieving Better Health Outcomes • Building Healthier Communities 
Our People and Culture • Diversity, Equity and Inclusion • Pay Equity • Employee Health and Well-Being • Training and Development 
Responsible Business Practices  • Corporate Governance • Compliance and Ethics • Data Privacy and Cybersecurity • Supply Chain Management • Supplier Diversity Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health A Modern, High-Performing Health System Responsible Business Practices Performance Data UnitedHealth Group and our  distinct, yet complementary,  businesses of Optum and  UnitedHealthcare are working  to help build a modern, high- performing health system with  improved access, affordability,  outcomes and experiences. A modern, high-performing health system anticipates the needs of its consumers  with systemwide collaboration, supported by value-based arrangements that  coordinate every aspect of patient care. It is responsive to the most urgent health  issues, focusing on driving measurable outcomes for local communities and the  people it serves, while lowering costs across the system. It is equipped with the data  and technology to facilitate better decision-making and better experiences, and a  dedicated focus on improving the health of this generation and the next. We have made significant progress by focusing on consumer needs, collaborating  across our business and the health system, and using technology to make health  care simpler and easier to navigate. Home-based and virtual capabilities are helping  more people access the care they need. Value-based care models are improving  patient outcomes and lowering the total cost of care. A whole-person approach to  behavioral and medical care is driving better health outcomes. Our health system  partnerships are creating greater efficiencies while helping providers focus on  providing high-quality patient care. But there is still work to do. Our fragmented health care system is still difficult to  navigate for many. Costs remain an impediment to accessing care, particularly for  those in underserved communities. Long-standing disparities in care have led to  unequal outcomes for various populations. We have the opportunity to address today’s challenges through the impact of our work  across UnitedHealth Group and our mission to help people live healthier lives and help  make the health system work better for everyone — not just for the 147 million people  our company serves, but for anyone who interacts with the health care system. Advancing Health Equity: By focusing on data,   organizational strategy, programmatic response and  community partnerships, our work to advance health   equity is rooted in our mission, embedded in our enterprise  strategy and connected to the growth of our business. Achieving Better Health Outcomes: By taking a holistic  approach to care delivery, we are working to reduce  the burden of chronic disease, provide comprehensive,  evidence-based behavioral health care, and address social  determinants of health with community partnerships. Expanding Access to Care: Reflecting our belief that  everyone should have access to high-quality, affordable  care, our integrated care models and virtual and home- based capabilities are helping more people get the care  they need where and when they need it. Improving Health Care Affordability: We are focused on  reducing the total cost of care across the health system  by advancing value-based care models, optimizing site of  service and working to lower prescription drug costs. Enhancing the Health Care Experience: We’re working  to create a seamless, simple experience for consumers  and providers with personalized navigational support and  streamlined health care payments, and by partnering with  health systems to provide better care for the communities  they serve. Building Healthier Communities: We are combining  our knowledge, experience and passion to support the  communities where we live and work, partnering with  community-based organizations to transform our health  system locally, and removing barriers to good health. Health equity is achieved  when every person,  regardless of race,  gender, location or  circumstance, has the  opportunity to live their  healthiest life. UnitedHealth Group is committed to enabling and delivering  equitable care that addresses health disparities and improves  health outcomes — an enterprise priority reflected in our  mission and supported by our five strategic growth areas. Today, however, there are still far too many barriers to good  health disproportionately experienced by people of color,  historically marginalized communities and people with fewer  economic resources. Health care inequities are rooted in long-standing disparities  in health across a broad range of social and economic  factors. High health costs and inadequate access are key  contributors. Institutional bias in evidence-based care  impacts the health status of different populations. Social  determinants of health, such as food insecurity, education  level and income, are among the many factors that contribute  to widening gaps in health and well-being. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has brought more attention  to health equity, we know disparities existed well before it  occurred. The United Health Foundation’s inaugural Health  Disparities Report, released last year, underscored the depth,  breadth and persistence of health disparities across the  country. We know women had a 70% higher rate of depression  than men between 2017-2019. And adults with less than a high  school education had a 123% higher rate of frequent mental  distress than college graduates in that same time frame. Racial  disparities in maternal health have widened since 2005, with  Black mothers continuing to face a disproportionately higher  rate of mortality over time. Deeply rooted disparities cannot be solved through a singular  program or initiative. We see the opportunity to advance  health equity in nearly every aspect of our ambition to help  build a modern, high-performing health system by improving  access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for every  person it serves. Health equity is ingrained in our business operations, from our organizational strategy to our population health insights. Our core  areas of focus are reflective of the specific areas where we can make significant headway to address long-standing disparities. Health Equity Data and Analytics  We are leveraging data to drive population-level insights  both within our company and across the health system. We are using those insights to set goals and inform our  business strategy. For more than 30 years, we have used  findings from America’s Health Rankings reports, along with  additional data and insights from our 350,000 employees,  to devise and deliver targeted, meaningful solutions that  address America’s health disparities — in health care,  insurance, clinical expertise and financial support. We are also working with partners across the health care  system to improve data transparency and address social  determinants of health. Our diversity, equity and inclusion  strategy is informed by the workforce and leadership data  across the organization. Organizational Strategy  Our commitment to advancing health equity is  embedded in our mission and supported by senior  leaders across the organization, including the Board of  Directors. Our chief sustainability officer oversees our  health equity agenda, which is informed by data and  supported by enterprisewide collaboration and our  strategic focus on comprehensive, value-based care  delivery, pharmacy services, health benefits, health  technology and health financial services. Community Partnerships  We seek to improve the health of underserved  communities by collaborating with community partners  and organizations that understand distinct, local  population health needs. We are working to assemble  partners through grant partnerships overseen by the  United Health Foundation, and we are convening like- minded organizations to contribute expertise, knowledge,  data and insights that can reduce health care disparities. Programmatic Response  Our large-scale philanthropic efforts combined with long- standing programs to improve health outcomes seek to  address some of the most pervasive health disparities. Our work is focused specifically on access to care, health  workforce diversity, social determinants of health and  maternal health. The United Health Foundation is making significant,  targeted investments of $100 million that will measurably  advance health equity by 2033. $100 million to create  a new philanthropic  program and partnerships  that will measurably  advance a diverse health  workforce by 2033 
The United Health Foundation  recently announced a $100 million  investment to deepen and scale  our efforts in health workforce  diversity to achieve meaningful  and sustained progress in  addressing health disparities and  advancing health equity. Research shows that eliminating  health care access disparities  for underserved populations is  estimated to result in a demand  for up to 145,500 additional  physicians by 2033. Our  investment in a more diverse  clinical workforce that better  reflects our society and is  prepared to provide culturally  competent care to all patients  can help reduce disparities in  health conditions, experiences  and outcomes. Throughout this report, we have highlighted the specific  ways we are helping advance health equity. UnitedHealthcare  Catalyst is using data and community partnerships to  develop sustainable solutions to meet local needs. We’re  caring for an increasingly diverse population in Medicare  Advantage, providing in-home assessments and connecting  them to support services. We’re working to build a health  workforce reflective of the communities we serve, both  through philanthropic giving and our own diversity, equity  and inclusion strategy. Our work to decarbonize our business  and the health care sector reflects the fact that certain  populations are disproportionately impacted by our changing  climate, exacerbating existing health inequities. Over the last two decades, we have led hundreds of local  and national initiatives, and invested millions of dollars in  partnerships with like-minded change-making organizations,  making advancing health equity part of the fabric of our  enterprise. From the development of our clinical policies,  to the organizations we partner with across the country,  to building a more diverse and inclusive health workforce  well beyond our own walls, a drive toward health equity is  embedded in who we are and how we operate as a company. We provide a holistic approach to care for those with  chronic, complex or behavioral health conditions that  require more coordinated care. • Delivering comprehensive behavioral health services  with health benefits that treat the whole person with  high-quality, supported care. • Addressing social determinants of health with data- driven insights and community-based partnerships  designed to reduce health disparities. • Managing chronic disease with personalized  pharmacy services and a whole-person approach to  care management. An estimated 1 in 4 American adults are affected each year by mental health   disorders. There has been a clear and growing need for more comprehensive  behavioral health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 in 3 adults reporting  symptoms of anxiety or depression, compared to 1 in 10 in 2019, and 13% of  adults reporting new or increased substance use to manage stress. UnitedHealth Group is addressing behavioral health challenges by delivering  wraparound health benefits that treat the whole person with high-quality,  supported care. Clinical and behavioral care are addressed in coordination with  support from virtual, pharmacy and in-person services. Our network of 300,000 behavioral health providers serves 37 million  individuals, with additional support through on-demand clinical capabilities and  digital self-care tools. Our People and Culture Environmental Health Responsible Business Practices Performance Data Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health 
Our integrated approach to medical and behavioral  care is demonstrated through more than 600 clinically  integrated community pharmacies co-located within  community mental health centers that work to bridge  the gap between behavioral and medical care to better  serve individuals with mental illness, substance use  disorders and other complex conditions. “I now have 19 medications  for my daughter, a stroke  victim, from four different  doctors and a certified nurse  practitioner. [The pharmacists]  recommended the pill  pack due to the difficulty  of correctly taking a large  number of pills at various  times of the day. This has been  an answer we needed to solve  a real problem.” In addition to pharmacy, these facilities provide access to a range of services and  can include primary care, labs, imaging and support from social workers who can  connect patients with food banks, transportation and other community support  services. Community pharmacies have driven better outcomes for underserved  populations, with higher medication adherence, while significantly reducing  emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Beyond care delivery, we are helping achieve better behavioral health outcomes by  investing nearly $30 million in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C., since 2019. These strategic philanthropic grants and community partnerships are designed to  improve access to behavioral health services, including substance abuse treatment,  and to grow and diversify the behavioral health workforce pipeline. Children and teens in particular have struggled with mental health challenges,  according to the 2021 Health of Women and Children Report by America’s Health  Rankings that showed a 21% increase in the number of children reporting anxiety  and a 26% increase in teen suicide. To meet the growing need, we partnered with local organizations like Valle del Sol  in Arizona to establish mobile medical units providing psychiatry, behavioral health  and primary care services to nearly 11,000 children at local schools and foster  homes over the next three years. In Wisconsin, our partnership with Children’s  Wisconsin established a crisis response team in the emergency department  available 24/7 for children with acute mental and behavioral health needs. We have partnered with the University of San Francisco and the University of San  Diego to build a diverse pipeline of child and adolescent psychiatrists by creating  new educational opportunities and providing students with financial support, which  enables them to pursue a career to address the distinct mental health needs of  children and young people. Social determinants of health (SDOH) are factors that influence a person’s  health and well-being, including housing, food and transportation. Too  often, underserved communities have limited resources in these areas to  provide a supportive environment for a healthy population. Connecting those  communities to the right social services can help address health disparities by  closing gaps in care. Collaboration with community partners is vital to addressing community needs,  improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities. UnitedHealthcare’s  Catalyst initiative is a distinctive community partnership model that works  with the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, public housing agencies,  federally qualified health centers and local community-based organizations to  improve health outcomes and reduce health inequities. UnitedHealthcare and its partners analyze claims, health care utilization and local  data to identify communities with large racial and health disparities and challenges. Working together, UnitedHealthcare and its partners develop common goals and  collaborative interventions that enable each organization to leverage its capabilities  to address local health challenges. “Optum and UnitedHealthcare worked with me and  advocated for close to four years to finally help me get  housed with services to help me live independently,  which I did not think I would ever be able to do.”  
Adam Burns, a member who received psychological, social services and housing coordination help  through Optum and UnitedHealthcare Treatment of chronic conditions accounts for more than $1 trillion in direct  health care costs each year, and the prevalence of chronic disease continues to  grow. We are helping patients with complex needs achieve better outcomes by  taking a whole-person, integrated approach to care management. Beginning in 2021, UnitedHealth Group, including the United Health Foundation  and UnitedHealthcare, is investing $4.5 million to increase access to health  care, improve health outcomes and advance health equity in communities  across Oklahoma, a state that ranks 42nd in the U.S. in access to primary care  providers, and 43rd in multiple chronic conditions, particularly among Native  Americans, according to America’s Health Rankings. Local partnerships are  providing integrated services for people with diabetes and comprehensive  geriatric care for Native Americans, and supporting people experiencing  trauma, food insecurity and social isolation. Medication management is a critical part of caring for people with complex  or chronic conditions, as they often require multiple drugs or treatments for  rare diseases. To help consumers manage complex medication regimens, our  personalized multidose packaging solutions support adherence and better health  outcomes. These solutions are integrated into Optum Rx’s home delivery operations  and have seen a meaningful increase in medication adherence. For people prescribed high-cost medications for complex conditions, such as  cancer and diabetes, our specialty pharmacy business provides access to limited- distribution drugs, a supportive care provider experience and disease-area expertise. Through Optum Infusion Pharmacy, our network of more than 1,100 nurses delivers  infusion therapy in patient homes as well as community infusion suites, providing  patients with easier, more convenient access to therapies that typically treat chronic  or serious disease. We use advanced analytics to ensure drugs are administered at  the most appropriate and cost-effective site of care. In 2021, we closed approximately 110 million gaps in care toward our  commitment to close 600 million gaps from 2021 through 2025. Overall  gap closure rates were impacted by the reduced level of preventive care  during the pandemic. We worked to mitigate this by increasing in-home  visits and member outreach activities. The 600 million gap closure target was based on the 2019 Healthcare  Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures established   by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). UnitedHealth Group is  committed to helping  ensure every person  has access to high- quality, affordable care  that meets their unique  health care needs and  financial means. • Maintaining a commitment to achieve universal  coverage in the United States by building on  existing, proven coverage platforms. • Building seamless, integrated care models that  combine virtual, primary, specialty, behavioral  and post-acute care. • Bringing care into the home with in-home  assessments, drug delivery and post-acute   care planning. • Connecting people to care through virtual  services that can lead to better health outcomes. Our integrated care models that bring together primary, specialty, behavioral,  post-acute and home-based care enable us to provide individuals with the  services they require when and where they need them. With more than 60,000 dedicated physicians, Optum Health’s care delivery  businesses serve nearly 20 million patients with a wide range of services including  primary, specialty, urgent and surgical care. Primary care physicians are the  anchor point for all patient care and are empowered with the latest information,  insights and best practices to help them efficiently coordinate care, manage  referrals and identify higher-quality, lower-cost options. This approach strengthens  the critical provider-patient relationship and streamlines access to care. Through its Dual Special Needs Plans (D-SNP), UnitedHealthcare provides services   for nearly 1.3 million Medicare and Medicaid members, who often have   multiple chronic conditions and limited incomes. Members benefit from our   clinical programs that support the whole person by taking an integrated approach   to care management based upon a comprehensive view of a person’s needs,  ensuring any medical, behavioral, pharmacy, social and environmental support  needs are addressed. D-SNP benefits include dental, hearing and eye care, in-home clinical care and  social services, behavioral health consultations, and access to up to $225 per  month for covered over-the-counter products and groceries, such as vitamins,  first-aid items and healthy foods. Increasingly, expanding access to care means bringing personalized care into  the home, particularly for patients with complex medical, behavioral and social  needs. Shifting care into the home can drive better health outcomes, access and  experiences, particularly for vulnerable members with physical limitations and those  who live in rural and underserved areas. For people in our Medicare Advantage plans, HouseCalls is a key element of our  approach to primary care delivery, providing comprehensive in-home clinical  health and wellness assessments by advanced practice clinicians to identify health  conditions and close gaps in care. The ability to engage patients in their home  provides better visibility into members’ diagnoses, medications and overall health. Available across the nation, HouseCalls provides Medicare Advantage members with  an in-home annual medical exam that includes a complete health history, a physical  exam, the identification of health risks and gaps in care, and the development of an  individualized care plan that is shared with the member’s primary care physician. Members are also assessed and referred to social services for needed assistance  with determinants of health, including food, medication and housing affordability,  transportation issues and employment assistance. “[The HouseCalls team] has come in and made it a lot easier for  us to maintain our health. They’re able to write prescriptions  for us right from [home] and we don’t have to call our PCP or a  specialist. It’s made life a lot easier for us.” For those transitioning home from the hospital, our post-acute care planning  and coordination works to bring together physician advisory services, hospital  medicine, emergency medicine and transition care to help individuals recover  faster. Nearly 10 million people benefit from post-acute care planning that  provides personalized care for their physical, mental and social needs. Our whole-person approach to home-based care delivery includes diagnostic  testing and pharmaceutical services. Recognizing that early detection and  preventive care drive better health outcomes, UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare  business brings members in-home testing for hepatitis C and prediabetes, two  diseases that lead to poorer outcomes if not detected and treated early. Real-time results from in-home testing allow our nurses to immediately connect  members to the appropriate resources or follow-up care, with approximately  three-quarters of those with a positive test visiting their primary care provider  within 180 days. Our pharmacy services strategy extends the most common health care touch  point into the home. Through pharmacy home delivery, we’re providing seamless  prescription refills and personalized multidose packaging solutions that help  consumers manage complex regimens of medications, supporting medication  adherence and better health outcomes. In 2021, 69% of our members  received preventive care services. Consistent with national trends,  preventive care declined from  2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic  disrupted care patterns. We took  many steps during the pandemic  to ensure people were able to  access the care they needed, such  as expanding telehealth access,  increasing provider incentives  to complete preventive care and  increasing access to in-home care. We continue to enhance our digital  tools and navigation support to  help people identify the screenings  and care providers they need. We  are accelerating the shift to value- based care arrangements with  providers where there is strong  alignment to coordinate and  prioritize preventive care services. UnitedHealth Group is developing and advancing technology to help connect people  to care where and when they need it. Our integration of virtual and in-person services  provides a more accessible, personalized and seamless care experience. Our Optum virtual care platform enables patients to connect with their own care  provider from anywhere. It facilitates telehealth capabilities and broad access  to Optum’s physicians, community-based clinics, pharmacies and home health  services in all 50 states. UnitedHealthcare’s virtual-first health plan empowers members to connect with  Optum’s virtual-based care team for help with everything from urgent care to  primary and behavioral health care services. Care team support is provided 24/7 via  message, chat, phone or video. Fully integrated, connected care must address behavioral health, and today we deliver  nearly two-thirds of our behavioral services in a virtual setting. We support individuals  with structured, measurement-based mental health care through a suite of virtual  solutions supported by licensed clinical social workers and coaches to help members  with mild to complex behavioral health needs. Similarly, our self-guided app offers  on-demand digital treatment support for stress, anxiety and depression, providing  clinically validated techniques and tools to more than 150,000 monthly active users. UnitedHealth Group is  committed to helping  reduce health care  costs at an individual  and system level. With health expenditures expected to reach $6.8 trillion by  2030, we are collaborating across the health system to make  health care more affordable for everyone. • Advancing value-based care models designed to improve  care coordination, drive better outcomes and lower the total  cost of care. • Optimizing site of service with transparent tools that help  consumers access the right care at the right time and place. • Lowering drug costs — particularly high-cost specialty  drugs — with comprehensive and transparent pricing and  by building a better, more affordable experience across  medical and pharmacy benefits. We have the opportunity to  address today’s challenges  through the impact of our  work across UnitedHealth  Group and our mission to help  people live healthier lives and  help make the health system  work better for everyone —  not just for the 147 million  people our company serves,  but for anyone who interacts  with the health care system. Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health A Modern, High-Performing Health System Responsible Business Practices Performance Data Our work to improve health care affordability begins with advancing a   value-based system that incentivizes providers to deliver high-quality,  coordinated care — improving outcomes and experiences and   lowering costs. UnitedHealth Group’s care delivery business is focused on advancing an  aligned, reliable organization that puts clinical quality and patient safety at  the center of everything we do. It starts with a commitment to a sustainable,  engaged, high-performing workforce that is continuously learning and  improving. We are also working to leverage new insights, best practices and  innovation to help improve value and total cost of care, and to achieve our goal  of a best-in-class quality care model for our members and patients. Through the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, we’re  helping care providers move toward a truly value-based system of care so they  can focus on what’s most important: their patients’ health. Optum Health is at the center of accelerating that transformation from a   fee-for-service to a value-based system of care delivery. Optum Health serves   more than 2.2 million people through value-based care arrangements, where   providers are paid based on the quality of care they deliver rather than the  volume of services. By integrating primary, specialty, urgent, post-acute,  behavioral and ambulatory care, Optum physicians care for the whole person,  leading to 25% fewer hospital readmissions. Our work to lower the cost of care is particularly impactful in the Medicare  Advantage program, which serves an increasingly diverse and clinically  complex population, where more than half of older adults live on less than  $24,500 per year. Studies show that older adults in Medicare Advantage save  40% in out-of-pocket costs compared to fee-for-service Medicare, with better  health outcomes. Additionally, Medicare Advantage provides comparable  benefits to fee-for-service Medicare at over 20% lower medical costs. In our  highest performing Medicare Advantage markets, medical costs are more than  30% lower than fee-for-service Medicare. 35% Our work to accelerate the shift to a value-based system of care extends beyond  UnitedHealthcare and Optum. By partnering with more than 119,000 providers and  nearly 900 hospitals in our accountable care organizations (ACOs), UnitedHealthcare  is lowering costs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial members, while putting  the consumer at the center of the health care experience. Those partnerships seek  to incentivize behaviors that will drive better outcomes and reduce the total cost of  care, supported by technology that provides member-specific recommendations and  refers patients to high-quality, cost-effective care providers. Overall, more than 14.4 million UnitedHealthcare members access care from  physicians in value-based arrangements designed to manage health care costs and  improve the patient experience. 16% Part of our work to advance a value-based system of care is rooted in the meaningful  opportunity to drive better outcomes and greater affordability for consumers and the  health system by helping people access high-quality care in a low-cost setting. Our research shows that shifting routine outpatient procedures from a hospital  outpatient department to a lower-cost ambulatory surgery center (ASC) would  reduce costs by 59% on average and save consumers $684 per procedure. Simply  shifting appropriate care from hospital outpatient departments to ASCs could save  the health system $75 billion over the next decade. Optum Health’s integrated direct care delivery platform is focused on optimizing site  of service at more than 2,000 primary, specialty, urgent and surgical sites. More than  60,000 physicians provide care through an integrated national care delivery network  that includes 24/7 virtual care as an extension of our physical care delivery locations. Integrating real-time patient information into the physician workflow is one way to  help patients access lower-cost care options and identify potential care opportunities. More than 637,000 health care professionals use UnitedHealthcare’s Point of Care  Assist, which integrates site of service cost data into existing electronic medical  records. Clinicians can instantly see member-specific price estimates for specialty,  lab and radiology services, giving patients more insight into decisions that can  affect their out-of-pocket costs. Nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults take at least one prescription  medicine, making the pharmacy the most frequently used  touch point in all of health care. Three in 10 Americans say  they haven’t taken their medicine due to costs. We understand drug costs matter to everyone — from  those taking a generic medication to manage a chronic  condition, to individuals accessing a novel therapy. We are  actively working to reduce those costs across the system for  consumers, employers and governments. Specialty drugs used to treat patients with complex  conditions make up more than half of all drug costs and are  projected to reach $505 billion in annual spending by 2023. Optum Rx is helping providers identify the best treatment  regimen, weighing clinical and financial information to help  customers have a better, more affordable experience across  their medical and pharmacy benefits. 55%+ of outpatient  surgeries and radiology  services among our  members will be delivered  at high-quality, cost-efficient  sites of care by 2030 
In 2021, close to 50% of outpatient surgeries and radiology  services among all domestic people served were delivered at  high-quality, cost-efficient sites of care. The percentage of care  delivered at these sites for our commercial fully insured and self- funded members increased, while the percentage for members  served through government programs remained relatively stable. We continue to increase the penetration and capabilities of  our physician point-of-care tools to help guide patients to  the most appropriate high-quality, low-cost care setting. We  are also enhancing our consumer transparency digital tools  to help members identify these settings and understand the  relative cost impacts. Our progress Optum Specialty Fusion offers a first-of-its-kind specialty medication management  solution to simplify care for patients with complex conditions and lower the cost  of expensive specialty drugs by allowing care providers to compare dozens of  clinically appropriate, lower-cost options. Selecting a lower-cost, therapeutically  equivalent immunosuppressive drug, for example, could save an average of $700  per prescription. A growing pipeline of new therapies has the potential to change medical care  for individuals with rare diseases and few or no treatment options. We seek to  organize and develop solutions to help patients access life-changing medications  using capabilities such as outcomes-based contracting, utilization management,  networks, distribution solutions and risk management. Beyond specialty medications, we are investing in solutions that provide consumers  with simpler, more transparent information at the pharmacy counter. Actionable,  real-time health information makes it easier for patients and their physicians to  make the best possible care decisions. Transparency tools at the point of care  provide patients and prescribing physicians with access to information about which  drugs are covered by a patient’s health plan, how much it will cost at the pharmacy  counter, or if a lower-cost alternative is available. Members benefit from better drug pricing transparency through Optum’s PreCheck  MyScript tool, which delivers real-time, personalized prescription information  to lower costs for consumers. Nine in 10 prescribing providers have access to  PreCheck MyScript, which instantly shows providers how much a drug will cost and  recommends equally effective, lower-cost alternatives, leading to better medication  adherence rates for those with diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension. MyScript Finder puts similar information into the hands of consumers through the  Optum Rx mobile app, providing clinically appropriate, less expensive options  with exact cost information. Members can also see different pricing options for  home delivery and individual retail locations. We provide the same transparency  and affordability to those without health benefits via a cash card that provides  prescription drug discounts at more than 64,000 pharmacies. UnitedHealth Group  is working to build a  simpler, less stressful  health care experience  that is more accessible,  more affordable and  easier to navigate,  enabling people to live  healthier lives. We are dedicated to creating a seamless system for those  who experience, provide and pay for care by offering  distinctive tools and services to help people navigate and  interact with a complex health system. We are enhancing the health care experience by:  
• Designing a system that is easier to navigate, with  seamlessly integrated direct-to-consumer offerings   and personalized support for those with complex   health conditions. • Partnering with health systems to improve community  health, creating greater efficiencies and allowing providers  to focus on high-quality patient care. • Simplifying health care payments for consumers and  providers with modern technology that seeks to transform  how people and organizations save, spend, invest and pay  for health care. We strive to offer a consumer-focused, seamless experience for those accessing  care, whether through an annual well-visit or complex surgery. In 2021, we launched a centralized, direct-to-consumer marketplace, available to all  Americans, that combines a cash pharmacy, virtual visits, diagnostics and more, to  address pharmaceutical, behavioral and clinical care needs. Through our online marketplace, people can access a same-day visit with an Optum  virtual care provider for as little as $55, or bundle mental health subscriptions to  manage depression and anxiety for as little as $9 per month. Users can find upfront,  consistent pricing for more than 900 prescription medications, receive free   shipping and save up to 78% on the most commonly used medications. Once people have accessed care, they often need support to navigate the   system, access health care information and make decisions. More than   15 million people nationwide are supported by UnitedHealthcare’s Advocate4Me   model, which leverages data and technology to provide a simpler, personalized  health care experience. Members are matched with an advocate equipped with real-time data that provides  a 360-degree view of the person’s health. Artificial intelligence tools quickly  review individual plan documents and provide more accurate and comprehensive  information. Predictive analytics proactively identify members with social needs,  allowing advocates to connect them to low- or no-cost community resources. Trustworthy care families can depend on  People with complex or specialized health care needs require even more support  in navigating the health system and coordinating care. UnitedHealthcare’s Special  Needs Initiative and Complex Care Concierge were created for children and adults  who need the most support, including those with Down syndrome or rare genetic  diseases such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and inherited types of cancer. More than 163,000 families have been paired with a trusted care advisor who  coordinates care to create a seamless experience.

Nearly half of U.S. physicians reported feeling burned out last year across all  specialties. High rates of emotional exhaustion, depression and anxiety have been  reported among health care workers after more than two years of responding to the  COVID-19 pandemic. • Optum is working to reduce burnout and improve the provider experience by  automating processes, investing in clinical platforms that remove administrative  barriers, and simplifying workflows at the point of care. As a result, Optum  clinicians experience a 12% lower burnout rate than national averages. • Through a partnership with the American Nurses Foundation, the United Health  Foundation has helped build a virtual support system to recognize nurses’  contributions to fighting the pandemic. Grant funding has also helped support  mental health programming for more than 154,000 nurses. Improving the health financial services sector by streamlining payments for  providers, payers and consumers is fundamental to reducing friction in the health  system. By focusing on health financial services, we are working to improve health  and financial well-being, transforming how people and organizations save, spend,  invest and pay for health care. Optum Financial supports consumers with more than 8 million health savings  accounts and has relationships with more than 2 million care providers. With   out-of-pocket health care expenses expected to reach nearly $480 billion by 2024,  our capabilities are designed to help consumers pay for care with health savings   and spending accounts, advanced financial education tools and consumer  engagement and payment services, and self-service tools that make it easier   to manage and save money. UnitedHealthcare’s Care Cash, a reloadable debit card, helps guide consumers   to eligible care, including virtual visits, physicians that meet quality and   cost-efficiency standards, and primary and urgent care. For UnitedHealthcare members, the newly released UCard combines the health  plan ID, over-the-counter benefits, healthy food benefits and rewards into an all-in- one member card that can be used to check into the doctor, shop for healthy food  and spend reward dollars. More than 6 million Medicare Advantage members are  expected to have the UCard by 2023. The same bias for simplicity extends to providers. We believe integrating the end-to- end health banking and payments experience will help providers be paid accurately  more often, faster and with less administrative burden, making payments simpler,  more convenient and more affordable for consumers. Optum Financial is building a frictionless health payment system to   give providers more time and resources to care for their patients. Optum Pay accelerates claims payments, improves accuracy and   reduces administrative work. At UnitedHealth Group, we combine our  knowledge, experience and compassion — as  a company and as individuals — to support the  communities where we live and work. To help  ensure every person, regardless of race, gender,  sexuality, age, location or income, can receive  the care they need when they need it, we partner  with like-minded organizations on efforts to  transform our health system and remove barriers  to good health. Through our business and foundations, we have provided over $1.2 billion in charitable donations since 2000. We do  this through philanthropic grants, in-kind contributions and disaster relief efforts, and by supporting our employees who  contribute their resources and volunteer their time to important causes around the world. Our philanthropic giving and charitable commitments span UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare, as well as  our charitable organizations, the United Health Foundation and the UnitedHealthcare Children’s Foundation. Our social responsibility strategy is guided by core areas of focus, including  expanding access to care, building and shaping the health workforce, and using  data to provide health disparities insights and deliver better health outcomes. Expanding Access to Community-Based Care   We believe health care happens locally, and improving the health of any community  means partnering with and supporting the local organizations that know their  communities best. We also know much of what influences care happens outside the  doctor’s office and medical clinic, contributing to health disparities we see today. In 2021, UnitedHealthcare supported local programs in 18 states and the District  of Columbia with Empowering Health grants to help people access healthy food,  improve health knowledge and connect to behavioral health care. Our partnerships also extend into communities that require targeted population  health interventions, often for those who have historically faced challenges  accessing high-quality care. In underserved areas of Washington, D.C., facing high rates of child poverty,  asthma and obesity, the United Health Foundation and Children’s National Hospital  Foundation are collaborating on a new, innovative approach to reducing barriers  to care and advancing health equity. We are connecting more than 3,000 children  and their families to services, bringing together school nurses, behavioral health  specialists and mobile medical capabilities to provide well-child visits, vaccinations,  and behavioral health and developmental screenings. Improving Access to Maternal Health Care  The realities of the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the need for greater  attention to the health of women of reproductive age and children, especially  women and children of color. Since 2017, UnitedHealth Group has invested $14 million in ongoing partnerships in  12 states and Washington, D.C., including nearly $9 million in new grants in 2021 to  address maternal and infant health issues across the country. These philanthropic  programs are designed to target at-risk populations and improve access to care  with a focus on prenatal and perinatal health, infant health, workforce development,  and mental and behavioral health. Annually, an estimated 500 underserved perinatal women in Brooklyn are  receiving screenings, breastfeeding support and newborn care services through  our partnership with CAMBA Inc., which deploys community health workers to  family shelters and public housing developments. In Louisiana, UnitedHealthcare  is partnering with community organizations to expand access to prenatal and  postpartum education, as well as access to transportation, healthy food and housing. UnitedHealth Group is building and shaping the health workforce with initiatives to advance diversity and cultural  competency, develop the health care talent pipeline, improve existing workforce capacity and support skills development  for the health workforce of the future. Promoting Equity and Diversity in the Workforce   We are building a 21st century health workforce equipped  to provide culturally competent care to underserved  populations. Since the inception of the Diverse Scholars  Initiative in 2007, the United Health Foundation has  provided more than $25 million in funding to support  over 3,300 scholarships for students of color pursuing  careers as primary care health professionals, particularly in  underserved communities. Our work to build a diverse health workforce includes the  growing field of health informatics and bioinformatics,  where Black, Hispanic and Native American people account  for only 7.1% of the workforce. To improve the pipeline  for students of color pursuing careers in this field, the  United Health Foundation is partnering with Harris-Stowe  State University to create a bioinformatics program for  undergraduate students at the historically Black university  located in St. Louis, Missouri. Since launching in 2018, Project ENABLE has created an  online master’s degree program in health informatics with  over 50 students currently enrolled, and engaged more than  200 undergraduate students from local Historically Black  Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in in-person and virtual  summer training programs. Improving Existing Workforce Capacity  Research shows that increased access to primary care is  associated with better health outcomes, a higher likelihood  of receiving preventive care such as immunizations and  screenings, early disease detection and treatment, and  better chronic disease management. However, more than  25% of Americans do not have a primary care physician, and  projected physician shortages underscore the ongoing need  to identify new and innovative ways for people to access  primary care at a location convenient for them. Through the United Health Foundation’s partnership with the  University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Medicine,  we have established an integrated training program for  medical students to meet the health care demands of a  growing and aging population in southern Nevada. Recognizing the shortage of mental health workers, we are  partnering with organizations to grow a diverse pipeline of  new clinicians. Our partnership with the Colorado Center  for Nursing Excellence is helping 43 currently employed  rural Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Behavioral Health  Fellows earn a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner  (PMHNP) certificate. The partnership will support an  estimated 3,000 to 12,000 rural Colorado patients annually,  increasing rural clinics’ behavioral health care services  capacity by approximately 25%.

As a first-generation college  student who grew up in an  immigrant family, Mayra’s goal  is to increase access to care for  the Hispanic/Latino community,  and she is interested in family  medicine, pediatrics, or OB/GYN. For Mayra, it’s personal: “I intend  to improve community health by  breaking down the same barriers  my parents and I faced.” 
Recognizing the impact that natural disasters,  COVID-19 and geopolitical crises can have  on the health of a community, UnitedHealth  Group is dedicated to supporting communities  around the world during times of need. Following the devastating impact of Hurricane  Ida in September 2021, the United Health  Foundation provided $1 million to help  Louisiana residents recover and rebuild. The  funds were distributed among four community- based organizations to help local residents  with immediate needs like access to food and  water, and to support longer-term recovery  and rebuilding efforts. To address the ongoing global impact from  the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Health  Foundation provided $1 million in response  to the coronavirus crisis in India, which  was experiencing an unprecedented public  health emergency with record-breaking  surges in cases and deaths in May 2021. This  donation builds upon the company’s global  commitment to fighting COVID-19, including a  previous donation of $1.5 million to India. The  contribution helped fund the procurement  of 2,500 oxygen concentrators, as well as  other critical medical equipment essential for  treating severe COVID-19 infections. To support relief efforts in Ukraine, the United  Health Foundation provided $1 million in March  2022, helping children and families access  food, water, hygiene kits and psychosocial  support, and supporting the Ukrainian Ministry  of Health with emergency medical supplies  and equipment. We leverage data that provides valuable insights on the nation’s health to  drive advancements in the health system. America’s Health Rankings, produced by the United Health Foundation,  is the longest-running state-by-state analysis of the nation’s health. The  data provides an objective measurement of each state’s strengths, areas  of opportunity, and important insights into health differences among  populations, including adults 65 and over, women of reproductive  age, infants and children, and those who have served in the U.S.  armed forces. This distinctive platform has garnered support from the  American Public Health Association and the CDC Foundation, among  others, and has been used by policymakers, community leaders and  health officials to better understand the specific health concerns in their  own communities. In 2021, AHR released its inaugural Health Disparities Report to  document the breadth, depth and persistence of health disparities  across the nation, and to provide objective national and state data to  inform action for advancing health equity. Building on 31 years of data  and reporting, the report highlights the constant and changing contours  of disparities across educational attainment, gender, geography, race  and ethnicity. “The America’s Health  Rankings Health Disparities  Report provides a unique,  data-driven analysis that  identifies disparities not  only according to race  and ethnicity, but also  gender, geography and  education level. Through  new analyses, this report  provides public health  officials and lawmakers  with state-specific findings  on their state’s largest  disparities so they can  plan better strategies to  address them.” The people of UnitedHealth Group are passionate about supporting their  communities. We support that passion by providing dedicated opportunities for  team members to give back and make a tangible impact, either through charitable  giving or volunteering. Employee giving is enabled through our year-round United for Giving program. We  support our employees and the causes they are most passionate about by matching  their contributions — dollar for dollar — to the community organization of their  choice. In 2021, the United for Giving program expanded to include nearly 36,000  eligible employees of companies recently acquired by UnitedHealth Group. Employee volunteering is another important feature of our United for Giving  program. We encourage, support and reward employee community volunteer  service by awarding employees who volunteer 30 hours per year with a $500 grant  to the community organizations of their choice. Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health A Modern, High-Performing Health System Responsible Business Practices Performance Data At UnitedHealth Group, we  understand the important role the  environment plays in the health of  every community. We believe the  environment is a key part of what  makes the communities in which  we live and work sustainable,  viable and healthy. A growing body of research shows how closely climate change is tied to human  health. Air pollution increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease  and lung cancer. Extreme heat is linked to increased hospital admissions for  cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory disorders. Intensifying wildfires can lead   to an increase in emergency department visits for respiratory conditions like   asthma or bronchitis. A healthy planet is the foundation for a healthy society, down to the water we  drink and the air we breathe. While every person is impacted by the health of our  environment, the impacts of climate change are distributed unequally among  disadvantaged populations in the U.S. and around the globe. Communities of color,  low-income populations and older adults are among those most likely to feel the  impact of climate change, further exacerbating existing health inequities. Our businesses touch nearly every facet of health care as we work to build a  modern, high-performing health system. We have the opportunity to contribute to  a stable climate and improve planetary health while building a better health care  system for future generations. • Committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard. • Leading a coordinated effort to reduce the carbon footprint   of the U.S. health system. •  Reducing our paper usage and advocating for the reduction of paper  across the health system to the greatest extent possible over the   coming years. • Diverting waste from landfills. • Ensuring efficient use of water. Recognizing the risks climate change poses to  human health, we are committed to setting net-zero  science-based emission reduction targets through  the SBTi to ensure our actions are based on current  climate science. We believe the environment is a key  part of what makes the communities  in which we live and work sustainable,  viable and healthy. We are minimizing  our impact on the environment  through long-term commitments  that reduce our carbon footprint. Over the next 24 months, we will be working with the SBTi to validate near-term  and long-term targets. In parallel, we will pursue near-term targets consistent with  reductions required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Our approach to achieving net-zero operations will rely on direct mitigation   of global emissions with minimal reliance on carbon offsets. Specifically,   we are focused on: 
• Completing an assessment and measurement of our entire footprint. • Improving energy efficiency in our buildings. • Investing in the transition to renewable energy. For 22 years, UnitedHealth Group has measured its  greenhouse gas footprint, and since 2011 we have set  emissions reduction goals. We are further advancing our  emissions measurement and we are proud to release our  first-ever comprehensive scope 1 and 2 inventory, located in  the data tables of this report. Our reported emissions have  increased in 2021 due to the following drivers:  
• Change in boundary: We reported all our global   businesses’ and fleet data within our operational   control for the first time. • Change in methodology: Sites that were previously  reported as scope 3 moved to scope 1 and 2. • Portfolio growth: Through business combinations. We are currently assessing our scope 3 footprint, which  we intend to complete in 2022. We plan to share our  most significant categories of scope 3 data in our 2022  Sustainability Report. In previous years, we disclosed scope 3 categories of waste  generated in operations, business travel and employee  commuting. Our deeper assessment in 2021 identified our  most significant categories as: 
The calculation of our scope 3 footprint combined with the  updated scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint will  give us a comprehensive baseline, allowing us to commit to  setting a net-zero science-based target and make meaningful  GHG reductions in the years to come. A significant part of our commitment to operational net-zero includes   identifying and scaling our reliance on renewable energy sources, which   will directly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve the health of   the communities where we operate. We are currently evaluating the sourcing of renewable energy across our  operations, including on-site and off-site renewable energy production, virtual  power purchase agreements and other renewable purchasing options. Examples  of renewable energy sourcing could include deploying on-site solar systems  on parking garages and rooftops at targeted core facilities, investing in off-site  renewable solar and wind development, and other renewable purchasing options  available through our utility partners. Our approach provides an opportunity to shift  the broader demand for renewable energy in the communities where we operate. To meet our operational net-zero commitment, we are scaling solutions that reduce  energy consumption in our entire real estate footprint — ranging from data centers  and pharmaceutical distribution centers, to clinical care facilities. This approach  includes new construction projects, renovations, collaboration with landlords and  simple employee behavior programs. For example, we are finalizing the construction of phase 1 of a two-building,  352,000-square-foot administrative campus in San Antonio, Texas. Phase 1 is  scheduled to open in 2022. It represents what will be the first WELL-certified campus  in our portfolio, an industry-recognized attestation measuring a facility’s health and  human experience attributes through building design and operations. We plan to  leverage this experience to inform future construction. Additionally, we continue to invest in energy efficiency projects, including   LED fixture upgrades, HVAC system replacements and Building Management  Systems installation. The U.S. health care  system is responsible  for 8.5% of U.S. carbon  emissions stemming  from health care facility  operations, energy  consumption, and the  supply chain of goods  and services. Recognizing the critical need to reduce the carbon footprint  of the U.S. health care system, UnitedHealth Group is proud  to be part of the National Academy of Medicine’s Action  Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector,   co-chaired by our CEO. This public-private collaborative with leaders from the federal  government, pharmaceutical and hospital industries, and  health professionals, seeks to address the health sector’s  environmental impact by focusing on four key areas. The collaborative seeks to mobilize the health care sector  by establishing shared decarbonization goals and evidence- based solutions to protect human health globally   and build a more equitable health system. In an increasingly digital world, the average consumer’s  health care experience too often involves paper. UnitedHealth  Group uses 2.8 billion sheets of paper annually to  communicate with members. Beyond the environmental impact, the paper-based  experience is often more time-consuming and cumbersome  for members. Members are asked to review and return  documents by mail or fax, or by scanning and emailing. Paper  creates inefficiencies that slow down decision-making for  members who expect timely answers about their health. We are working with a diverse set of stakeholders, including  employers, consumers, providers, health equity advocates  and the health care industry, as well as regulators and  government partners. Of all the paper we generate, we estimate  roughly 40% is related in some way to regulatory direction and  requirement. Collaboration with government, regulators and  others will be critical to reduce or eliminate as much of this  usage as possible and create digital solutions and alternatives  for paper-based processes. We are committed to reducing our paper usage and  advocating for the reduction of paper across the health  system to the greatest extent possible over the coming years. We are working toward providing paperless experiences for  consumers and providers — a dual-purpose goal designed  to minimize use of energy, water and raw materials while  creating a better consumer experience. Reducing paper usage would also improve the speed and  simplicity of our member communications by replacing  paper-based communications with digital tools. Our multidimensional approach to minimizing our  environmental impact includes ongoing management of our  various waste streams, including municipal, construction,  electronic, hazardous and regulated medical and  pharmaceutical waste. With our scope 3 enterprisewide waste-associated carbon  emissions inventory underway in 2022, our focus on waste  reduction remains an important part of our sustainability  strategy. Additionally, we are considering an enterprise  diversion rate goal for 2023, to be informed by our ongoing  comprehensive inventory assessment and several pilots. • In the Asia-Pacific region, we removed all single-use plastic  and paper products in 2021, preventing over 68,000  pounds of waste in a landfill annually. • Our Optum Technology team manages a successful  electronic waste recycle/reuse program that avoided 600,000  kilograms of waste in 2021 by repurposing or recycling  electronics, including over 100,000 notebooks and PCs. • Increasing the medication pack sizes carried by Optum Rx  home delivery pharmacies, which could lead to the disposal  of 546,000 fewer plastic bottles and caps per year. • Piloting the use of insulated mailers to ship medications  that require refrigeration, which could eliminate an  estimated 1 million gel packs per year. • Piloting a reusable, closed-loop medication cooler for  pharmacy deliveries that measures the temperature and  location of the package, allowing for retrieval and reuse of  coolers multiple times per month and reducing the number  of reshipments. Water scarcity is an emerging concern in parts of  the world, making water conservation a critical but  often overlooked global health issue. Since 2019, we have worked to ensure our facilities use water as  efficiently as possible. We conducted a phased U.S. administrative  portfolio review in 2018 using LEED water efficiency guidelines to  evaluate interior water use and the EPA’s WaterSense tool to evaluate  exterior water use, incorporating the U.S. Drought Monitor to identify  water-sensitive areas. We will be refreshing this study in 2022. Following that review, we sought to upgrade legacy water fixture  systems for more efficient fixtures and fittings, and we continue to  evolve our standard project guidelines to water systems that are  increasingly more efficient. For example, we saw an 8.6% reduction  in water use at legacy U.S. administrative sites that received our  touchless water fixture deployment in 2020. We currently deploy  water-efficient touchless fixtures in all our construction projects,  including our new campus under construction in San Antonio, Texas,  which will be WELL-certified. UnitedHealth Group developed and implemented a holistic water- tracking program for our India real estate portfolio, a region where  91 million people lack access to safe water. We made investments in  2021 to install technology-enabled digital water meters at 14 sites to  remotely measure, monitor and influence water usage. The digital  water meters measure freshwater and recycled water (used for the  flushing of water closets) and will be key in developing future water  efficiency goals in this water-stressed geography. of our managed U.S. administrative square  footage met indoor water efficiency measures  (using LEED water efficiency guidelines). We  plan to conduct this analysis again in 2022 to  account for our growing portfolio. Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health A Modern, High-Performing Health System Responsible Business Practices Performance Data of participants in our Disability  Inclusion Internship program converted  to employees over the last two years. We are a global team of 350,000 — including doctors, nurses, technologists,  data scientists, care advocates, administrators, researchers and more — united  by our culture and values: integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and  performance. We strive to create an inclusive and engaging environment in which  people can do their life’s best work, enabling healthier lives and working to build  a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability,  outcomes and experiences. At UnitedHealth Group, we know the extraordinary happens when we value, include  and learn from diverse people and perspectives. To ensure our people flourish, we  take a data-driven, science-based and human-centered approach to attracting,  developing and retaining the world’s best diverse talent. • Advancing a diverse, equitable  and inclusive environment where  all team members feel welcomed,  valued and heard in order to reach  their full potential. • Improving employee health and  well-being by making it easier for  all team members to pursue better  health and by using our expertise  and resources to move toward  healthier together. • Developing and growing our  talent with our employee-centered  culture, transparency and mobility,  and a comprehensive approach to  talent stewardship aligned to our  business strategy. At UnitedHealth Group, we celebrate our people,  ideas and experiences — creating a culture where  all team members are appreciated, valued and able  to contribute to their full potential. We join together as individuals, forming a team as diverse   as the people we serve, one person at a time. We are committed to building an innovative culture   where diversity is celebrated, equity is realized and   inclusion is embraced. We formed the Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)  Office in 2021, composed of subject matter experts, internal  consultants and organizational advisers. The Global DEI Office  leads the enterprise strategies for diversity, equity, inclusion  and associated learning resources. We created a strategic framework to advance our long- standing commitment to diversity and inclusion. We started by  elevating and adding “equity” as a strategic focus, which shares  our commitment to building solutions that meet the diverse  needs of our people and patients we are honored to serve. Our diversity, equity and inclusion framework is anchored by  three overarching pillars: people, workplace and marketplace. We seek to create a workforce reflective of the communities  we serve. We want all team members to feel a sense of  belonging and inclusion and we are committed to growing  our business and improving the diversity of our suppliers and  health care professionals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is enhanced  through our integrated approach of improving our leadership,  systems and culture. At UnitedHealth Group, we approach diversity, equity and  inclusion like any other business priority, with transparency,  leadership accountability and a data-driven approach to  setting priorities and measuring progress. We monitor our progress by listening to our people. In  2021, we launched a new Inclusion Index in our employee  surveys to help us better measure and understand employee  sentiment related to fairness, affirmation, safety, identity and  connection. We leverage these insights to improve hiring and  developing, engaging and retaining our talent. For the second year, we published our recently filed  consolidated EEO-1, prepared in accordance with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s categories for  reporting race, ethnicity and gender data. We established an Advancing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  Board made up of members of our senior executive team,  who meet quarterly to hold us accountable for making  progress. We partner with our diversity business councils  and employee resource groups to better understand how to  integrate diversity, equity and inclusion into our leadership,  systems and culture. We seek to understand the lived experiences of our diverse  team members to help them reach their full potential and  deliver innovative solutions. As part of our commitment, we  are reviewing our talent systems and processes through the  lens of diversity and inclusion. Starting with recruiting, at our  most senior-level roles, we set goals to ensure the pool of  talent is inclusive of underrepresented groups. We are advancing our efforts to increase diversity in our  workforce, anchored by successful programs that recruit  team members and leaders who are women, people of color,  military members and veterans, LGBTQ+, people of all ages  and people with disabilities. We are enhancing our diversity partnerships with a broad range of  organizations to support the development and mentorship of diverse   talent pipelines and connect new sources of talent to career opportunities   in our workforce. Through a partnership with Prospanica, an organization that empowers  Hispanic professionals, UnitedHealth Group was recognized with the 2021  Brillante Award for Corporate Excellence, based on our contributions to the  educational, economic and social well-being of the Hispanic community. The award honors corporations with a proven track record of success in the  recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce. • Association of Latino  Professionals for America  (ALFPA) • Black Enterprise  • Executive Leadership  Council (ELC)  • HBCU Initiative —  Morehouse School of  Medicine  • INROADS  • National Black MBA  Association (NBMBAA) • National Association  of Asian American  Professionals (NAAAP) • National Black Nurses  Association (NBNA)  • National Association of  Hispanic Nurses (NAHN)  • Prospanica — National &  Chapters 
• Out For Undergrad helps LGBTQ+ undergraduates reach their full potential. • Rewriting the Code supports women in tech. • National Academy Foundation (NAF) prepares high school students for college  or a career. • Genesysworks provides pathways to career success for high school students  in underserved communities. • INROADS provides students with professional tools, planning and access to  career immersion activities. • We also have a robust strategy with historically Black colleges and universities. We support the LGBTQ+ community by partnering with organizations that support  LGBTQ+ equality, and by offering benefits like Pride365+, an online resource hub  that features resources to educate and support LGBTQ+ community members  and allies in creating open, safe and respectful working and living environments. We partner with Proud to Work to develop employment equity for everyone, and  Reaching Out MBA (ROMBA) to educate, engage and develop our workforce. Our Disability Inclusion Internship Program is a 12- to 15-week  internship that provides meaningful employment opportunities  to individuals of all disabilities. This program resulted in a 70%  conversion rate into permanent employment over the last two  years. The Disability Equality Index® recognized UnitedHealth Group  as one of the best places to work for disability inclusion in 2021. We recruit transitioning service members, veterans and military spouses through programs such as the  UnitedHealth Group Military Fellowship Program, which provides career skills, training and workforce reintegration  to transitioning U.S. military service members in partnership with the Department of Defense SkillBridge Program. In  2021, UnitedHealth Group ranked among the top 10 in the nation on the Military Friendly® Employers list, the highest  award an organization can receive, which is reflective of our focus on hiring and retention efforts. Through our Pro Bono Program, we partnered with MERIT Health Leadership  Academy to create a program expansion plan to replicate their model in other  cities. As a result, 250 health care and STEM students in Baltimore were impacted. MERIT educates and empowers students from underrepresented backgrounds to  become health professionals and change agents who advance equity. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Learning System serves as a primary self-service  resource for individual and team development. These learning experiences are designed to  build inclusive leadership behaviors, develop personal awareness, examine bias, promote  allyship, and grow resilience and resourcefulness. We promote education, ongoing  dialogue, connection and awareness to mitigate the effects of unwelcome bias, and we  support an environment where every employee can bring their authentic self to work. Our United Culture program is supported by culture ambassadors and more than 120 leaders throughout the enterprise who  serve as culture facilitators, working to ensure our values are understood and demonstrated across the organization. This  volunteer culture community creates and leads culture and engagement activities and learning experiences that underscore  our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion; social responsibility; and well-being. Culture leadership workshops and foundational learning provide key building blocks for sharing and reinforcing cultural  messages and aspirations for employees. We are committed to and continue to prioritize pay equity  for all employees. Fair and equitable compensation practices  within a pay-for-performance framework support our culture  and are critical to achieving our mission. We continue to work with independent, third-party experts to  perform reviews of our compensation practices and evaluate  pay equity in several respects, including by gender, ethnicity  and race. A 2021 review of our integrated workforce — including our  global operations — indicates women earn $1 for every $1  men earn performing similar work at similar levels. In addition,  employees of color in the U.S. earn $1 for every $1 white  employees earn performing similar work at similar levels. To prevent pay inequities at hire, we do not ask candidates  in the U.S. about salary history during the hiring process. This practice helps us remove any bias that can come from  crafting initial compensation packages based on salary history. Through our collective efforts, we foster and sustain  a healthy, high-performing culture in which our  team members feel energized and empowered to  do their life’s best work. • Our next-generation, modern way  of working includes three work  models to promote a collaborative  and inclusive culture while balancing  the needs of the business with the  increased preference for flexible  working arrangements and flexible  working hours. • Adoption assistance, including  reimbursement of up to $10,000  for full-time employees and $5,000  for part-time employees for eligible  expenses for each adopted child. • Our expanded paid parental  leave provides both primary and  non-primary caregivers up to  six consecutive weeks of paid  leave upon the birth of a child or  placement of a child for adoption/ foster care. This benefit can be used  flexibly to support a continuous  full-time leave, supplement a short- term disability claim, allow a reduced  work schedule, and/or extend a leave  beyond FMLA requirements. • Paid caregiver leave offers two weeks  of paid time off to care for a child,  parent, spouse or domestic partner  who has a serious mental or physical  health condition. • Support for nursing mothers, which  includes access to private lactation  spaces while on site, time off during  the day to pump, and no-cost access  to Milk Stork for mothers traveling on  company business. • Family support benefits, which offer  employees center- and home-based  child care or elder care, subsidized  by UnitedHealth Group, to use  when regular care arrangements fall  through or are unavailable. • Tuition reimbursement for   employees who work 20 hours or  more per week. They are qualified   for up to $5,250 per calendar year   for job-related coursework in  accredited programs. At UnitedHealth Group, we aim to make healthy living easier by providing all  employees with choice, flexibility and a simplified work experience. As part of our commitment to the health and well-being of our employees and their families, our Rewards for  Health Program makes it easy for our employees to take actions to invest in their health while earning incentives. Rewards for Health recommends personalized activities based on each employee’s unique health indicators. Rewards can be used to offset medical premiums, deposited into a health savings account (HSA) or put into  a Stride Rewards Account to be used for health and well-being purchases. Some employees can earn enough  rewards to cover their entire premium cost for the year. Changes to the program in 2021 resulted in increased engagement in healthy activities, particularly by  employees with higher health risks. We ensure employees and their families have access to a  variety of mental health resources. The full spectrum of  resources to support team members and their families  ranges from caregiving and financial help, to mental health  counseling and solutions to prevent burnout. •  Enhancing Live and Work Well — our employee assistance  program (EAP) — to provide a simpler and improved  employee experience. Our EAP provides a wide range  of support, including 24/7 access to a life coach and  a variety of online resources. EAP services include  parenting resources, work/life concierge, backup child  and elder care, access to a money coach and free in- person counseling sessions. •  Providing 24/7 access to virtual behavioral coaching —  an eight-week digital program that offers personalized  support with a dedicated coach to help manage  symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety. •  Establishing an internal burnout coalition, composed  of leaders from across the enterprise, to collaborate on  combating the increasing issue of employee burnout and  working to ensure a systemic approach is prioritized to  support UnitedHealth Group employees. •  Offering additional clinician support through programs  such as Joy in Practice, created by the Center for  Clinician Advancement, with the goal of promoting a  healthy and joyful work environment. •  Creating employee resource groups, such as Working  Parents United, to build community and peer support. Helping to build  a modern, high- performing health  system requires a  workforce that is  constantly learning  and innovating. Career pathing needs to start early, with robust onboarding and digital  tools for self-assessment, learning and development planning to help  our team members grow their careers at UnitedHealth Group. Our talent practices reflect our employee-centered culture and promote  transparency, mobility and a modern approach to talent stewardship  that is aligned to our business strategy and values. In addition, our  practices promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture. Our talent development initiatives provide employees with self- assessment tools, learning experiences, and both formal and informal  education. We invest in mentoring, coaching and sponsorship to  provide stewardship and remove roadblocks. As we grow our key talent  segments, we evolve rotational programs to grow skills and careers in  critical jobs. People leadership programs equip our leaders with tools, resources  and an aligned vision so they can deliver the best experience for our  employees, which in turn enables them to deliver the best experience  for our customers. We introduced a People Leader Goal to set clear  expectations for leaders to create authentic connections, a sense   of belonging and a commitment to our mission. We listened to our  talent, leveraging natural language processing to explore more than  300,000 comments from employee surveys to evolve and bolster our  leadership culture. This People Leadership Initiative yielded strong adoption throughout  the executive population and will scale across the enterprise in 2022 for  deeper and broader impact. Our talent management initiatives support a workplace where  employees are included and visible, and have a clear understanding of  their strengths and capabilities to guide their career journeys. We enhanced technology platforms to organize talent data, working  across teams and stimulating mobility across the enterprise. We  maintain talent momentum through a consistent rhythm cycle of  high-potential identification, development planning, talent reviews and  succession planning in order to remove succession gaps and facilitate  talent movement based on development and succession plans. Our  talent management programs promote a culture invested in and  accountable to building a diverse workforce by ensuring diverse talent  is identified and included in all succession plans. Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health A Modern, High-Performing Health System Responsible Business Practices Performance Data UnitedHealth Group’s management structure and responsible  business practices, developed for over 40 years, supports our  ability to help build a modern, high-performing health system. Our principles of ethics and corporate governance outline  the behaviors and responsibilities that provide the foundation  for our actions, how we protect entrusted data, and the  expectations we set for our suppliers. These practices ensure  we are working to achieve our mission consistent with our  values and those of society at large. • Maintaining strong and effective corporate governance  to drive sustained shareholder value and respond to  the interests of our shareholders. • Adhering to our values through compliance and ethics  principles that guide our behavior and help us remain a  trusted partner. • Maintaining data privacy and cybersecurity,  recognizing our obligation to build and maintain  the trust and confidence of our stakeholders  and customers and ensuring we can protect the  information of all those we serve. • Partnering with suppliers to maximize value in our  supply chain to ensure we buy the right goods and  services from the right suppliers for the right price,   in a timely manner. • Committing to supplier diversity by developing a  supplier base that reflects the communities and  customers we are privileged to serve. • Utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence  to ensure technology is developed, deployed and  monitored ethically and responsibly, and is aligned  with our mission. Upon the election of the 2022 director nominees, the  average tenure of our board will have dropped from  12.6 years to 6.6 years since our 2021 annual meeting. Our board has enhanced governance policies over time to  align with best practices, drive sustained shareholder value  and respond to the interests of our shareholders. The Board of Directors Governance Committee reviews  corporate governance practices at least annually and  recommends modifications to the board for approval to  strengthen our governance. Additional information on our  corporate governance policies and board committees is  available in our proxy statement and on our Corporate  Governance webpage. We believe an effective board consists of a diverse group of  individuals who bring a variety of complementary skills and a  range of personal and business experience to their positions. The collective experience of our directors covers a wide range  of geographies and industries, including health care and  clinical practice, insurance, consumer products, technology,  capital markets and financial services, and roles in academia,  corporate governance, government, intergovernmental  organizations and business leadership. The board’s diversity is considered in the director nomination  process and assessed annually when the board evaluates  overall effectiveness. We are committed to actively seeking  women and racially/ethnically diverse director candidates. Upon the election of the 2022 director nominees, our board  will be 25% female independent directors and 38% racially/ ethnically diverse independent directors. Our directors may  serve on three other public company boards and our CEO may  serve on one other public company board. We strive to maintain a balance of tenure on the board. Long-serving directors bring valuable experience with our  company and familiarity with the successes and challenges  the enterprise has faced over the years, while newer directors  contribute fresh perspectives. Independent board leadership is another important component  of our governance structure. We separate the positions of CEO  and chair, and our bylaws require the company to have either an  independent chair of the board or a lead independent director. We value and respect the rights of our shareholders and have implemented strong  shareholder practices. Our directors are elected annually by a majority vote of our  shareholders. UnitedHealth Group does not have a dual-class share structure and  no supermajority shareholder approval provisions, as each share of common stock  is entitled to one vote. We do not allow shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount in  the event of a takeover attempt. Shareholders can call a special meeting and act by  written consent. Our bylaws also contain proxy access with standard market provisions. Directors are subject to a conflicts of interest policy and tender an irrevocable offer  to resign if they do not receive majority support. From there, the board will accept,  absent a compelling reason. Having received a 72% “For” vote on our annual Say on Pay proposal last year,  as compared to an average of over 95% support from 2011 through 2020, we  sought feedback from shareholders to better understand what motivated their  votes and what actions we could take to address topics relating to our executive  compensation program. We were pleased to hear shareholders indicate their strong support of the overall  design of our executive compensation program as well as the company’s overall  pay-for-performance philosophy. To be responsive to shareholder feedback, we  took a set of responsive actions to concerns raised by shareholders, which can be  found in the proxy statement. Our values – integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation  and performance – guide our behavior and help us maintain  the trust that comes with this responsibility. By adhering to our values, we are well-positioned to achieve  our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make  the health system work better for everyone. Our Code of Conduct provides guidelines that help us sustain  the highest possible standards of ethical behavior. The Code of  Conduct is published and available to employees in one of the  official languages of every location where we operate, including  Brazilian Portuguese, continental Portuguese, Spanish and  English. The code sets expectations for ethical conduct across  our company, including but not limited to: 
• Integrity • Accountability • Fair Competition and Fair Dealing  • Privacy and Information Security • Our Assets and the Environment • Government Interactions • Communications • A Safe and Supportive Working Environment 
The expectations set forth in our Code of Conduct provide  a clear guide for our employees to navigate potentially  challenging ethical situations, including corruption and  bribery, discrimination, confidentiality of information,  conflicts of interest and anti-competitive practices. The code  describes how to report misconduct, whistleblower legal  protections, reporting confidentiality and help line contact  information, how the company reports violations (including  termination and possible legal action), non-retaliation  principles, fair dealing, and the protection and proper use of  personal information and company assets. The Code of Conduct applies to all employees, contractors  and subsidiaries. Our entire global workforce, including  independent contractors and part-time employees, receives  periodic training on our code and other ethical standards. New team members complete training on the code as part   of their onboarding, and employees confirm annually   they have read the code and adhere to its principles. UnitedHealth Group’s policy is to provide a respectful work  environment that is free from all forms of harassment,  including sexual harassment. At UnitedHealth  Group, we understand  our tremendous  responsibility to do what  is best for the health  and well-being of the  millions of people we  are privileged to serve. Senior leadership oversees our Compliance and Ethics  program and provides regular reports to the Audit and Finance  Committee of the UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors that  detail performance on key compliance and ethics indicators. UnitedHealth Group’s Internal Audit department provides  objective audit and advisory services that identify and mitigate  risks throughout the company, including periodic audits of  the Compliance and Ethics program. UnitedHealth Group’s  Compliance and Ethics Office maintains our code, reviewing it  regularly to ensure continued support of our commitment to  integrity and good corporate conduct. 96% of employees agreed that the compliance and  ethics training provided them with adequate information  to operate in compliance with the policies, laws and  regulations associated with their job. Compliance and Ethics Assessment  Periodically, UnitedHealth Group engages   external consultants to assess the enterprise  Compliance and Ethics program against  government compliance guidance, regulatory  expectations and industry practices to evaluate  program effectiveness. In addition, UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare  and Optum conduct regular assessments  consistent with the Department of Health and  Human Services Office of Inspector General and  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  requirements, Department of Justice guidance and  other applicable regulatory requirements. In 2022, our Compliance and Ethics team began  building an interactive cloud repository to  automate input from our business partners and  aggregate results, reaching a broader group of  individuals who provide insight. UnitedHealth Group maintains internal policies at  the enterprise, business segment and department  levels that provide more specific direction beyond  the core elements of the Code of Conduct. • Anti-Corruption Policy  • Anti-Kickback Policy • Antitrust Policy • Conflicts of Interest Policy • Economic Sanctions and Sanctions Monitoring Policy • False Claims Acts Compliance Policy • Gifts and Entertainment Policy • Human Rights Policy • Environmental Health and Safety Policy • Insider Trading Policy • Interactions with Pharmaceutical, Medical Device or Biotech  Manufacturers, Wholesalers or Distributors • Non-Discrimination Policy • Non-Retaliation Policy • Personal Information Privacy and Data Protection • Reporting Misconduct  • Political Contributions Policy • Outside Directorships Policy • Related-Person Transactions Approval • Social Media Policy and Guidelines • Statement of Ethical Marketing • Travel and Expense Management Policy • U.S. Federal Government Contracting Policy UnitedHealth Group believes supporting human rights is core to advancing our  mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work  better for everyone. We are committed to a company culture that embraces  inclusion, diversity, innovation and growth while upholding the highest ethical  standards in how we operate internally and externally. One way we demonstrate this  commitment is to require all employees to complete either a manager or employee  training course covering sexual and other harassment and discrimination. In keeping with the spirit of the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business  and Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, our commitment extends to respecting  the human rights of all those with whom we engage and employ. See our Human  Rights policy for more details. We engaged a third party to conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment in  2022. This work helps us understand the human rights impact associated with our  operations, value chain and business relationships. We will engage stakeholders to  prioritize our impact and develop a plan for ongoing monitoring. We strongly and broadly encourage employees to raise compliance and ethics  concerns, including concerns about accounting, internal controls, auditing,  and ethical, legal, regulatory and policy matters. We offer several channels for  employees and third parties to report compliance and ethics concerns or incidents,  including contacting a reporting manager and compliance officers, and dedicated  phone lines and email addresses controlled by our Compliance and Ethics Office  and our Compliance and Ethics HelpCenter (EthicsPoint). Individuals may choose to remain anonymous in jurisdictions where anonymous  reporting is permissible. Once an investigation concludes, the Compliance,  business, Human Capital and Legal leads associated with the case discuss potential  disciplinary actions, if necessary, to determine whether disciplinary action is  consistent with similar cases across the enterprise and ensure uniformity in  disciplinary decisions. We prohibit retaliatory action against any individual who, in good faith, raises  concerns or questions regarding compliance and ethics matters, reports suspected  violations, or cooperates in an investigation. We train all employees annually,  and periodically remind them regarding how they may report possible ethics or  compliance issues and their affirmative responsibility to report any issues. Due diligence is required prior to engaging third parties that provide goods or  services to UnitedHealth Group outside the U.S. The level of due diligence required  will depend on the risks presented by each third party. The following reviews are  performed for all prospective third parties that will provide goods or services to  UnitedHealth Group outside the U.S.: 
• All third parties are screened through World Check, the company’s current   online screening tool, to determine if there is a match with a person or   entity in the World Check database. • Third Party Red Flag Considerations are reviewed to determine whether   any red flags are present. • Whether the third party will interact directly or indirectly on behalf of  UnitedHealth Group with public officials or public entities. • The UnitedHealth Group International Compliance group determines whether  the third party being considered is a Higher Risk Third Party. When making its  determination, UnitedHealth Group International Compliance may consider other  available information, such as the nature and value of the services or products to  be provided, and the reputation for corruption or bribery of the country in which  the services or products will be provided. • The engagement of the third party cannot proceed without the written approval  of UnitedHealth Group International Compliance. This approval may include  conditions upon which the engagement may proceed. Our communications with customers, members, employees, clinicians and other  stakeholders reflect our values and commitment to high standards of personal  and institutional integrity. Our sales and marketing activities serve our business  objectives, foster enduring relationships with our stakeholders and build trust one  person at a time. Our reputation stands upon the relationships we maintain with the  public, the media and those who interact with our company. We review all marketing materials to ensure accuracy, clarity and compliance  with applicable laws and regulations, such as the Medicare Communications and  Marketing Guidelines established by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services. These materials seek to provide straightforward descriptions of services  offered so our members can make informed decisions about their health care. UnitedHealth Group purchases pharmaceuticals and health  care products through our direct suppliers and other goods  and services through our indirect suppliers. Our procurement departments collaborate with our business  segments to identify, engage and manage our supplier base  to meet business objectives, enable growth and mitigate  risk for UnitedHealth Group and the individuals we serve. We  maximize value in our supply chain by creating competitive  markets for our internal business needs to ensure we buy the  right goods and services, from the right suppliers, for the  right price, in a timely manner. UnitedHealth Group has an enterprisewide Supplier Risk Management Program  governed by an Enterprise Vendor Risk Committee. This group oversees the  Supplier Risk Management Program with common standards, including regulatory  and compliance requirements, applicable to suppliers participating in the health  care value chain. We are committed to addressing the negative impact the changing environment  has on human health, including in the supply chain. For that reason, we have made  climate risk a key component of our ongoing sustainable procurement activities. We collaborate with the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) to retrieve qualitative and  GHG emissions data from targeted suppliers to establish a baseline from which  future reduction goals will be developed. The targeted suppliers represented  roughly 35% of our centrally managed procurement spend in 2021 and account  for a material basis of GHG emissions across our spend categories. We will use  this data to inform our GHG scope 3 inventory baseline measurement in 2022 and  engage our suppliers on climate risks and opportunities going forward. See page 62   for a further discussion. In parallel with establishing our scope 3 inventory, we engaged a third party to  conduct a supply chain ESG risk assessment to strengthen collaboration with  key suppliers and manage sustainability risks. This assessment includes ESG and  modern-day slavery criteria to assess our suppliers and inform our sustainable  procurement program refinement in 2022. UnitedHealth Group recognizes that we play an important role in advancing  responsible environmental and social sustainability practices across our supply  chain. We expect our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which  touches on various social and environmental items and references requirements  within our standard procurement contract language. Because UnitedHealth Group is entrusted with the protection of individuals’  most sensitive and personal health data, we place the utmost importance on  protecting our data and information systems. We require suppliers with access to  our information systems, customer data, or health plan member data to have the  appropriate security controls when doing business with us, including maintaining  their HITRUST certification or an acceptable third-party validated assessment. We ensure key suppliers meet our performance expectations through a systematic  Supplier Performance Management Program that monitors compliance with  our Code of Conduct and monthly performance of contractual Service Level  Agreements related to service delivery, quality and value delivery. Data-driven supplier performance scorecards are shared quarterly with executive  leadership to identify performance trends and areas of opportunity to drive  improvement plans for underperforming suppliers. Suppliers are evaluated on  criteria such as financial stability, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance,  organization resiliency, diversity participation and Net Promoter Score. Annually, we review the sustainability practices of critical suppliers to identify  policies, practices and goals for waste and carbon reduction, recycling and  other sustainability measurements. In 2021, we reviewed suppliers' sustainability  performance representing 29% of our Enterprise Sourcing & Procurement   program spend. UnitedHealth Group’s supplier diversity program  seeks to proactively integrate businesses  from underrepresented communities into our  supply chain, which creates a multiplier effect,  including job creation and income for people in  underserved communities. That value creation extends beyond our businesses to positively impact  the communities we serve and extends our societal impact beyond our  members and customers. We conduct an annual community impact assessment of our diverse  supplier spending to better understand how our efforts are supporting   local communities. • National Minority Supplier Development Council and 23 Regional Affiliates  • Women Business Enterprise National Council and 14 Regional Partner  Organizations  • U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  • National Veterans Business Development Council  • Disability:IN  • National LGBT Chamber of Commerce  • National Association of Women Business Owners  • Diversity Alliance for Science 
UnitedHealth Group’s supplier diversity program had its strongest  year in 2021, driven by core metric improvement and maturing our key  business processes and stakeholder engagement. Implementing effective  control, enhancing reporting and process measurement, and broadly  communicating the program’s culture and objectives helped grow Tier 1  spend with certified diverse suppliers by 17% from 2020 to 2021. We recognize the importance of supplier diversity and are committed to ensuring  diversity is an integral part of our strategic sourcing and procurement processes. Every request for proposal (RFP) managed by the Enterprise Sourcing &  Procurement (ES&P) team targets the inclusion of at least one diverse supplier,  where available. We evaluate RFPs through a balanced scorecard that considers  diversity alongside other key factors, including cost, quality and service delivery. Additionally, we build supplier diversity into ES&P category plans, and growth  objectives are developed and tracked annually to ensure continued progress. In 2021, we expanded our Tier 2 program efforts deeper into our supply chain  by inviting more prime suppliers to participate in the program. Prime suppliers  provide diverse vendors with opportunities to participate in subcontracts awarded  in connection with UnitedHealth Group business. In 2021, our identified Tier 2  spending increased 36% year over year. In 2021, we hosted our Diverse Supplier Summit, which brought   more than 100 diverse and prime suppliers together with executives from  UnitedHealth Group’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Office, UnitedHealthcare,  Optum and other corporate functions. The summit offered our suppliers insights   on our strategic priorities and the role diverse suppliers have in helping us move   our business and the health care industry forward. In addition, our leaders shared  ways diverse suppliers can develop sustainable strategic partnerships with  UnitedHealth Group business partners. In 2020, we developed a pro bono accelerator model to help build the capability of  diverse suppliers to grow their business with us and other companies. We piloted  the program with a minority and woman-owned consultancy focused on clinical  research in minority populations and health disparities. In 2021, we expanded the program to five suppliers across several different  demographic groups. Each supplier was paired with a project team as a mentor to  assist in developing targeted capabilities, as defined by the supplier. We are actively  working with the diverse suppliers to capture the impact of the accelerator program  on their business. Dragonfli Group is a disability- owned business enterprise (DOBE)  that participates in UnitedHealth  Group’s accelerator program. Glenn  Ballard, Dragonfli’s CEO, founded  the cybersecurity firm in 2008. He engaged UnitedHealth Group  to gain a fresh perspective from  experts who have “been there” and  who could share lessons learned  from successes and failures. Glenn was specifically looking  for assistance in creating a new  outreach and recruitment program  to reach underserved populations  while engaging current employees  to assist in their upskilling and  professional development. “The mentor team at  UnitedHealth Group has been  incredibly helpful in working  with us to identify practical  solutions that expand our  team’s versatility and expertise  while considering the unique  components of this industry. The program helped turn  some of our ideas into action  by helping us navigate  the challenging course of  talent recruitment in a very  competitive market.” 
Introduction Our People and Culture Environmental Health A Modern, High-Performing Health System Responsible Business Practices Performance Data We believe health  care data and related  information should be  used solely to improve  individual health,  advance health system  performance and aid  in new health care  discoveries. UnitedHealth Group receives personal information from or  about individuals (such as health plan members, patients,  customers, employees, or other persons whose information is  provided to or received by UnitedHealth Group or its business  partners) as part of our day-to-day business activities. While  health care data and information are critical to our ability to  serve our customers and the health system, we recognize this  information is highly sensitive and personal. As a result, we must build and maintain the trust and  confidence of our customers and stakeholders, ensuring  we can protect the information for all those we serve. We  are required to safeguard personal information reasonably  and appropriately and to use or disclose such information  only as authorized by the individual or in compliance with all  applicable laws. Primary tools used to fulfill these obligations  are cybersecurity and data privacy programs. UnitedHealth Group’s chief information officer, chief compliance and ethics officer,  chief privacy officer and chief information security officer are responsible for  administering our data privacy and security programs at the executive management  level. The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and  assesses the effectiveness of UnitedHealth Group’s policies, procedures and  resource commitments in the areas of compliance, ethics, privacy and cybersecurity. The committee receives regular updates covering critical issues related to one or  more of the following topics: our information security risks, cybersecurity strategy  and business continuity capabilities. In 2021, we established a Cybersecurity Leadership Council (CLC) to enable  aligned executive ownership and delivery of information security initiatives across  UnitedHealth Group. The chief information officer of each line of business or a chief  information security officer will sponsor each initiative and lead implementation. The CLC will oversee analysis, risk tolerance, policy, funding and implementation of  information security initiatives, and the transition to standard operating processes  to ensure sustainability. UnitedHealth Group manages cybersecurity and data protection through a robust  framework that provides our team members with training and resources that support  their day-to-day activities, assesses the risks our company faces, and establishes  policies and safeguards to protect our systems and the information of those we serve. UnitedHealth Group’s data protection policy applies to all lines of business and  subsidiaries. Data is assigned a classification based on its sensitivity level and  protected by security requirements defined by the policy. Data sent externally must  meet security requirements outlined by our enterprise data-sharing processes such  as management approval and strong encryption. Our Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to protecting the information  entrusted to us. Supported by a comprehensive set of principles, our policies and  programs describe appropriate uses of data and the safeguards that protect the  confidentiality and integrity of our systems, including: 
• Enterprise information security policies. • An enterprise resiliency and response program. • An incident management program that encompasses cybersecurity, privacy and  compliance obligations. • Privacy and data protection policies, including guidance on information handling. • An enterprise data governance program, including related policies. • Enterprise risk management and information risk analysis programs. • The Safe and Secure with Me employee training and awareness program –  required annually for employees who handle Protected Health Information. We regularly evaluate the security maturity of our systems. This includes vulnerability assessments and penetration  tests conducted by our internal team and qualified external  assessors. These efforts allow us to identify operational and  design risks and vulnerabilities in our systems. We use these  tests to help us identify opportunities to address emerging  security threats and improve system security as we work to  enhance our ability to protect information and data. UnitedHealth Group’s IT infrastructure and information  security management systems have been audited by internal  and external auditors in the last fiscal year. These audits have  resulted in certifications from industry-recognized certifying  organizations such as HITRUST, International Organization  for Standardization (ISO), System and Organization Controls  (SOC) and the Payment Card Industry (PCI). UnitedHealth Group manages a robust Information Security  Risk Management and Privacy Program that improves its  ability to make risk-informed decisions by conducting  systematic and structured reviews of information security  risks. Its protocols are based on industry practices and  applicable regulatory obligations such as the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), European Union General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer  Privacy Act (CCPA), and other requirements decreed by  state, federal and international authorities. Our Internal Audit team is engaged to advise on  strengthening compliance with applicable laws and  regulations. The team leverages a combination of auditing  and security frameworks to evaluate how best practices are  applied throughout our enterprise. This approach gives us  the ability to address risk from multiple perspectives and  implement layered remediation strategies. Furthermore,  our Internal Audit team independently assesses security  controls against enterprise policies to evaluate whether  compliance is maintained. The results of internal audits are  communicated to executive leadership and presented to  the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors  quarterly. Audit findings are tracked in the form of action plans  and managed within an enterprise governance, risk and  compliance tool. Owners are assigned, remediation  timelines are established and progress is regularly reported  to senior management. Annually, we conduct an enterprise information risk  assessment (EIRA) in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group’s  overall enterprise risk management assessment. In the  EIRA, we complete a comprehensive review of internal and  external threats and evaluate changes to the information  risk landscape to inform the investments and program  enhancements we will make in the coming year. There continues to be heightened risk caused by  sophisticated enhancements to ransomware and the  creation of criminal networks and affiliates that extend the  reach and skill of attackers. We continue to engage with  our suppliers and internal development teams to remediate  known vulnerabilities and are keeping a close eye on  upgrades that can be leveraged to mitigate future risk. UnitedHealth Group continues to monitor cyber threats and  invest accordingly across our systems. We are investing  in new capabilities to ensure rapid response and recovery  from potential attacks, including system rebuild and  recovery protocols to ensure key systems are restored fully  and rapidly, a step beyond the current protocols of data  center failover. Business continuity exercises are prioritized  and focused on technology interruption due to ransomware. UnitedHealth Group  uses artificial intelligence  (AI) and machine  learning (ML) in support  of our mission to help  people live healthier  lives and help make  the health system work  better for everyone. We are committed to  helping ensure that AI  is developed, deployed  and monitored ethically  and responsibly across  our company. When developed and used responsibly, AI/ML can  empower people with the information they need to make  personal health choices, provide physicians with insights to  assist their decision-making, and enhance the performance  of the health care system. AI/ML can augment human  tasks, assisting with disease progression management,  including tailoring care decisions to individuals, identifying  emerging risk of disease early, improving engagement and  adherence, and improving efficiency and consistency of  administrative processes. The health care industry as a whole is in  the early stages of implementing AI/ML. As AI/ML solutions continue to evolve,  it is important to ensure they are used  responsibly by continuously assessing  and improving our governance processes. We adopted the following principles  as guideposts to develop, deploy and  monitor our AI/ML solutions. Accountability  Establish measures and be prepared  to act swiftly to address and remediate  misuses or adverse outcomes. We established a governance structure consisting of   leaders across UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare and  Optum to provide oversight on strategy development and  guidance for investments and capability development of   AI/ML. This governance established foundational principles  for the responsible use of AI/ML and a Responsible Use of ML  program. The program is designed to provide a holistic and  structured approach to using AI/ML responsibly. In 2022, we will integrate the Machine Learning Review Board  as a key component of the Responsible Use of ML program. The board will proactively review AI/ML models for bias and  similar issues and advise analytics teams. The program will  provide guardrails in the application of innovative solutions  that advance the health care system. As we move forward, we will supplement our foundational  principles with a guide for all analytics teams to support  consistent practices to responsibly develop and use   AI/ML. The Responsible Use of ML program will make this  guide available to all employees, along with training. We  will develop a technology framework that standardizes and  automates AI/ML quality checks for use across our enterprise. Finally, we are engaging with industry and academic partners  to review our best practices and to co-research and publish  leadership for the benefit of the health industry. We recognize that the use of AI/ML can have unintended  consequences, including consequences that can arise from  bias in the health care system, data or algorithms. We take  steps throughout the design, development, deployment  and monitoring of AI/ML to help mitigate bias. These steps  include forming a team with a range of expertise to help  identify potential issues, assessing the data and model for  potential sources of bias and developing cross-discipline  mitigation approaches to mitigate bias. We are developing  processes for situations where bias or risks to health equity  are found that may include suspending or delaying release   of AI/ML until the risks are addressed through a   mitigation plan. UnitedHealth Group  engages in efforts to help  shape and inform public  policy decisions that  ensure all people have  access to high-quality,  affordable health care. Our  participation — including  making bipartisan political  contributions — is  designed to improve the  health care system and  positively impact all of   our stakeholders. Our public policy engagement is focused  on addressing the most pressing health care  challenges and opportunities in the communities  where we live and work. Public policy efforts  are led by UnitedHealth Group’s External Affairs  organization, with engagement and partnership  across UnitedHealth Group, including the Optum  and UnitedHealthcare businesses. We engage government officials at the federal,  state and international levels, serving as a   trusted and solutions-oriented voice in the  important discussions about health care   reform and modernization. • Developing and advancing public   policy solutions. • Conducting internally generated research  to provide key insights on the most pressing  issues facing the health system. • Partnering with leading academic institutions  to work jointly on health care research and data  analysis efforts. • Fostering strategic partnerships with key  stakeholders on policy and advocacy initiatives. We believe every person — regardless of race, gender,  sexuality, age, location or income — deserves to be  healthy. We are committed to helping ensure every  person has access to high-quality, affordable health care  that meets their unique health care needs and financial  means. We support solutions that build on the strengths  of today’s health system and leverage innovative, proven,  private-sector approaches and successful public-private  partnerships. Achieving universal coverage by strengthening and  expanding existing coverage options and public-private  partnerships. We believe that the 29 million uninsured  individuals in the U.S. can be covered through Medicaid,  exchanges and the individual market. Improving health care affordability with the goal of  reducing health care costs for consumers, employers,  governments and the broader health care system. We  believe this can be accomplished through a series of  solutions, including transitioning to value-based care,  addressing the high cost of prescription drugs and  delivering more care at lower-cost sites of service with  better clinical outcomes. Enhancing the health care experience by expanding  the use of secure digital tools that deliver personalized,  actionable cost and quality information, streamlining  and standardizing quality measurement and increasing  workforce capacity by amending state and federal scope   of practice laws. Achieving better health outcomes by improving care  quality to reduce the burden of disease. We believe  improved health outcomes can lower health care costs by  40% by compensating providers for cost-effective, high- quality care, promoting evidence-based clinical approaches  to care delivery and improving health literacy. Political contributions are part of our efforts to advance  solutions intended to ensure all people have access to high- quality, affordable health care. Our Political Action Committee  is managed by a long-established governance process, which  includes thorough review and approval of each contribution,  and public disclosure of contributions in accordance with  our political contributions policy, including publishing semi- annual political contribution reports on our website. Our board’s Governance Committee, which oversees our  overall strategy on ESG policies and practices, has oversight  of our advocacy and lobbying processes and activities,  including key trade association and coalition memberships,  as well as for the review of political contributions made by  the company and its Political Action Committee. The Governance Committee of the UnitedHealth Group Board  of Directors oversees the company’s political contributions  policy. The Health and Clinical Practice Policies Committee  of the UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors oversees the  company’s policies, positions and practices concerning  broad public policy issues, including those that relate to  health care policy and regulatory issues. UnitedHealth Group files federal lobbying disclosure  reports quarterly with the U.S. Congress, and state lobbying  disclosure reports with the appropriate state governing  agencies and in compliance with applicable laws. Additional  information on our public policy priorities can be found in  The Path Forward.

Explanation of our energy and emissions data: As part of our commitment to environmental health, we have measured a subset  of sites and sources of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for two decades, increasing the breadth of  measurement over time. In 2021, in order to establish a baseline for our operational net-zero target, we performed a comprehensive  analysis of our energy usage and scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint. As a result of this analysis, we updated our GHG accounting  methodology to include the data collection and estimations for all our facilities and fleets for all our controlled entities around the  world. This update expanded upon the previously reported energy and emissions. Under the updated methodology, the 2021 energy  and scope 1 and 2 emissions data accounts for 100% of UnitedHealth Group-controlled operations.

UnitedHealthcare covers certain medical services under the  preventive care services benefit. The federal Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires non-grandfathered health plans  to cover certain “recommended preventive services” as identified  by PPACA under the preventive care services benefit, without cost  sharing to members when provided by network providers. Non-Grandfathered Plans • Non-grandfathered plans provide coverage for preventive care  services with no member cost sharing when services are obtained  from a network provider. • Under PPACA, services obtained from an out-of-network provider  are not required to be covered under a plan’s preventive benefit  and may be subject to member cost sharing. Refer to the  member-specific benefit plan document for out-of-network benefit  information, if any. Grandfathered Plans • Plans that maintain grandfathered status under PPACA are not  required by law to provide coverage for these preventive services  without member cost sharing, although a grandfathered plan may  choose to voluntarily amend its plan document to include these  preventive benefits. • Except where there are state mandates, a grandfathered plan  might include member cost sharing, or exclude some of the  preventive care services identified under PPACA. • 2021 Sustainability Report: A Modern, High Performing Health  System — Preventive Services Long-Term Commitment, page 36. 1.

global emissions to net zero by 2050. However, the world is not on track to achieve this goal. Achieving net zero by  
2050 requires transforming the global energy system, as well as making significant changes in how key goods and

As a global financial institution, our strategy is focused on providing financing, strategic advice and investment services  
A key aspect of our low-carbon strategy is how we engage with our clients in carbon-intensive industries on their transition. In  
2020, we pledged to align key sectors of our financing portfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In May 2021, we became  
the first large U.S. bank to set 2030 targets – which we set as portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets for the Oil &  
We also announced our plans to expand our targets to new sectors of our financing portfolio over time. In October 2021, we  
joined the NZBA, a group convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative which brings together a  
global network of banks committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. While thoughtful policy, technology and behavioral advancements are all prerequisites in realizing our common goals around net  
zero emissions by 2050, we joined the NZBA because we support the ambition for greater climate action, the sharing of best  
practices and a collaborative approach between the public and private sectors to reach this goal. We may further address  
important details of these efforts as they develop over time, including where we believe practical considerations may constrain  
our work against the ambitions of the NZBA – such as the necessity of technological advancements, the evolution of consumer  
behavior, the need for thoughtful climate policies around the world, the challenge of balancing short-term targets with the need  
to facilitate an orderly and just transition, and other critical considerations such as legal and regulatory obligations. Participating in industry initiatives will also support our efforts to develop targets for other sectors and engage with a growing  
Since setting our first portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets, we have focused on implementing them in the  
management of our Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing financing portfolios. As part of this, an assessment of our  
in-scope clients in these sectors – for both lending and debt capital markets transactions. This assessment allows us to: 1) build  
in a view of our client's decarbonization trajectories during the decision-making process on a potential new transaction, as a  
factor in our usual approval processes, and 2) assess both our client's progress and in turn, our own progress towards our Our assessment framework uses a variety of quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate clients’ current emissions  
our assessment framework was led by the CCT, along with partners such as key Banking and Risk Management groups. We will continue to build on our efforts in key portfolios over time, particularly as we expand to additional targets and sectors. The low carbon transition is a focus for our banking teams, and we continue to build our ability to provide tailored  
advice and solutions to our clients as they adapt and grow their businesses in a changing world. Whether a client is  
working to transition their business model and operations to reduce emissions, or to develop and grow new  
technologies or solutions to help address the climate challenge, our objective is to use our capital and expertise to help  
them succeed. As we expand our capabilities, we are able to provide clients with increasingly diverse and innovative  
For example, in October 2021, we acted as Joint Placement Agent on a $1 billion equity placement to capitalize a new  
passenger EV subsidiary for Tata Motors. Recognizing the potential and capital needs of the passenger EV business,  
the transaction was designed to attract investors seeking exposure to this segment and enable Tata Motors to  
As another example, in June 2021 we acted as Active Bookrunner on a $1.5 billion green bond offering by NextEra  
Energy. NextEra owns and operates two businesses – Florida Power & Light, the largest utility in the U.S., and NextEra  
Energy Resources, the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar – which are working together  
toward a goal of reducing NextEra’s emissions 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline. The bond, proceeds of which will be  
used to support a portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage projects, uses a mechanism to encourage

While PPP loans are not part of the Firm’s Racial Equity Commitment, JPMorgan Chase  was the #1 PPP lender on a dollar basis – over the life of the program, we funded more than 400,000 loans for more than $40 billion. More than 30% of those loans  went to businesses in majority-minority census tracts. •  While small business lending volume through 2021 is below 2019 levels, the Firm expects to make progress against the $2 billion small business lending commitment  in the years ahead. •  Spend an additional $750 million with Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers. •  Spent an additional $155 million with 140 Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers. •  Help one million consumers open low-cost checking or savings accounts by  opening branches in underserved communities and increasing marketing to  reach more underserved, unbanked or underbanked consumers. •  Opened an additional 10 Community Center branches in low-to-moderate communities, often in urban areas with larger Black, Hispanic and Latino populations. •  Hired more than 100 Community Managers in underserved communities who serve as local ambassadors to build and nurture relationships with community leaders,  nonprofit partners and small businesses. •  Build a more equitable and representative workforce and hold executives  accountable by incorporating priorities and progress into year-end performance  evaluations and compensation decisions for members of the Operating  Committee and their direct reports. •  Expanded the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program to create three new employee programs supporting Hispanic and Latino employees, LGBT+ employees and  Asian and Pacific Islander employees. •  The Firm pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024, and exceeded the total goal this year by hiring 4,192 Black students as interns, fellows and entry-level analysts. •  Provide $2 billion in philanthropic capital to advance an inclusive economic recovery  and support Black, Hispanic and Latino and other underserved communities. •  Committed $396 million toward our philanthropic target, which includes grants, low-cost loans and direct equity. fostering an inclusive work environment where our employees are respected, trusted and encouraged to bring their

employees at all levels within the Firm. In 2021, taking into account factors such as an employee's role, tenure, seniority

Pay equity reviews give us important insights, but they are just a starting point. If we identify individuals with  
compensation that is less than expected, we dig deeper. Where appropriate, we take action to address it. We are proud  
of the overall diversity of our workforce. However, we also know that women and ethnically diverse employees still are  
not represented in as many senior management positions as are men and White employees. We are taking a variety of

The JPMorgan Chase Institute is a think tank dedicated to leveraging the Firm’s data to produce insights on the inner  
small businesses facing economic hardship due to the pandemic, our Firm released The First 100 Days and Beyond. The  
report highlighted research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute and the work of the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter to  
inform data-driven recovery policies to provide immediate support to those most impacted by the pandemic in the U.S.,  
as well as longer-term policies to increase the financial health and stability of households and small businesses. In  
addition, as the Firm advances the objectives of our Racial Equity Commitment, we are drawing on the work of the

Investing in communities is a route to expanding economic opportunity. Housing, in particular, is a central pillar of  
community development because access to a stable, affordable home is a leading determinant of income and wealth,  
affordable housing crisis has put this access increasingly out of reach. For example, 43% of Black and 40% of Hispanic  
households spent more than 30% of their incomes on housing as of 2019, compared with 25% of White households. 30

Financial Health events with more than 36,000 people in attendance, and participated in more than 600 Community Service events. “It’s an honor to play a part in  helping individuals and  businesses achieve their  financial goals, no matter what  those goals may be,” said Jordan  King, Los Angeles Community  Manager. “We’re here to provide  education and support to help  break down barriers that drive  lasting change, and discuss  important topics like budgeting,  saving and building credit. It  starts with meeting residents  right where they are, and that’s  exactly what we’re doing.” Responsibility for oversight and management of ESG is defined at multiple levels within the organization. Oversight of  
ESG matters is an important part of the Board's work in setting the policies and principles that govern our business,

We regularly solicit and  respond to customer and client feedback about our products,  services and organization as a whole, and endeavor to build  long-lasting relationships based on trust and mutual respect. •  We engage regularly with our customers in our branches and through our website and social media platforms. We take pride in providing inclusive interaction. For example, we have multi- lingual staff in many of our branches and are investing in sign language interpreters at key locations – e.g., near Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. We also seek customer feedback  via online and in-branch surveys, with the aim of improving customer interaction and experience, and have a conduct hotline through which our customers can anonymously raise concerns  and report misconduct. •  We also engage with our clients through one-on-one meetings, roundtables and conferences – for example, the Firm’s Annual Health Care Conference, which aims to connect global industry  leaders, emerging fast-growth companies and innovative technology creators. •  We listen and respond to the needs of our customers and clients by offering products and services that emphasize social and environmental responsibility, including lending for affordable  housing and electric vehicles and supporting minority-owned businesses through financial literacy coaching. Our people are at the heart of JPMorgan Chase and are  vital to our success. We work to understand our employees’  evolving needs and perspectives. •  We engage with our employees through surveys, including our global Employee Opinion Survey and Exit Surveys; town hall and small group meetings; focus groups; blogs, articles and  newsletters; online feedback tools; and other forums. •  Engagement surveys are conducted periodically and allow us to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement to promote continued employee satisfaction and retention. •  Our CEO-led Town Halls cover topics such as business strategy and outlook, emerging industry trends and our progress on key Firm initiatives such as the $30 billion Racial Equity  Commitment and $2.5 trillion Sustainable Development Target, and provide opportunities for employees to ask questions of our senior management. We are committed to ensuring the Firm's decisions are  informed by diverse perspectives, particularly those of the  communities we serve. •  We are engaging with external stakeholders in a variety of forums. Through our longstanding Chase Advisory Panel program, we facilitate regular conversations among senior  JPMorgan Chase executives and consumer policy groups, non-profit organizations, civic leaders, trade associations and diverse chambers of commerce, many of which are sources of  information and ideas about how the Firm can promote racial equity through our products, services and approaches. In addition, in 2021 we created Community Engagement and National  Stakeholder and Policy Engagement teams to further local engagement and two-way dialogue with stakeholders. •  We communicate to shareholders through our Annual Report and Proxy Statement, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, press releases and the Firm’s website. In addition, we  engage with shareholders through quarterly earnings calls, investor meetings and conferences, annual shareholder meetings and other forums. We conduct a formal shareholder outreach  program focused on topics including corporate governance, shareholder rights, executive compensation and sustainability. In these meetings, management shares information and provides  updates on these topics, addresses questions and solicits shareholders’ perspectives and feedback. Directors participate in these meetings as appropriate. Following each shareholder  outreach program, shareholders’ areas of focus and feedback are shared with the Board. •  We also engage in dialogue with shareholders outside these more formal channels. These engagements provide us with useful feedback, which we consider when developing the Firm’s  processes, practices and strategic direction. We strive to maintain an open, ongoing dialogue with our  global supervisory regulators and other policymakers. We  believe that responsible corporate citizenship demands a  strong commitment to a healthy and informed democracy  through civic and community involvement. •  We engage with policymakers on a range of issues, including banking, financial services, cybersecurity, workforce development, small business, tax, trade and inclusive economic growth,  among others. We engage with regulators as necessary to conduct business and provide commentary on proposed changes to relevant regulations affecting our business. We recognize that our clients, shareholders and other  stakeholders are interested in our performance on a range of  ESG matters. We regularly engage with ESG raters to provide  them with information relevant to the Firm. •  We engage in open, transparent dialogue with rating agencies in order to better understand their methodologies and scoring, correct discrepancies and provide feedback. Our Corporate  Sustainability and Investor Relations teams manage our relationships with ESG rating agencies and lead our efforts to identify and implement enhancements to policies, procedures and  practices that can improve our ESG performance and address any known issues. •  We also spend time and resources to educate relevant internal stakeholders about ESG ratings so they are prepared to respond to questions from clients about the subject. We strive to meet the information needs of members of the  investment community, including both financial and ESG  analysts and researchers. •  We provide extensive information to members of the investment community, including both financial and ESG analysts and researchers, through reports, presentations, quarterly earnings,  regulatory filings, conferences and publications on our website. In addition, we respond to surveys and specific information requests, and engage with analysts and researchers through  calls and meetings. We engage in dialogue with our key suppliers on topics  including our ability to operate efficiently and effectively,  deliver products and services that meet our clients’ and  customers’ needs, manage risk and controls and drive our  diversity, equity and inclusion agenda. •  We interact with our key suppliers on a frequent basis through various channels, including regular business reviews, ad hoc meetings, phone, town halls and email. We are committed to  holding our suppliers to high standards of business conduct and integrity, and we work together to make a positive impact in the communities where we do business.

(JPMorgan Chase) contained in this Sustainable Bond Annual Report,  that as of February 28, 2022, the net proceeds of $1,246,875,000 from the August 10, 2021 issuance of JPMorgan Chase’s Fixed-to-Floating Rate  Notes due 2025 were allocated to refinance Eligible Green Projects as defined in management’s assertion. JPMorgan Chase’s management is  responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assertion based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s assertion is fairly  stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management’s assertion. The nature,  timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of  management’s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  reasonable basis for our opinion. Only the information included in the “Project Type” and “Number of Projects” columns and funded amounts up to $1,246,875,000 in the “Funded  Amount Allocated to Notes” column within the table entitled “Use of Proceeds and Expected Impact Metrics” contained in this Sustainable Bond  Annual Report is part of JPMorgan Chase’s management assertion and our examination engagement. This Sustainable Bond Annual Report is  included as an appendix to JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report (ESG Report). The other information in this  Sustainable Bond Annual Report and JPMorgan Chase’s ESG Report have not been subjected to the procedures applied in our examination  engagement, and accordingly, we make no comment as to its completeness and accuracy and do not express an opinion or provide any assurance  on such information. In our opinion, management’s assertion that, as of February 28, 2022, the net proceeds of $1,246,875,000 from the August 10, 2021 issuance of  the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Notes due 2025 were allocated to refinance Eligible Green Projects as defined in management’s assertion is fairly  stated, in all material respects.

We have built Citizenship into how we do   business every day. “We aim to be a   force for growth and   a force for good. We see   these as inseparable.” We offered the resources to help keep  our employees safe and protected. We  provided many of the brands people  count on to take care of their personal  health and hygiene and to create  healthy homes. Since the beginning  of the pandemic, we donated tens of  millions of dollars’ worth of product,   in-kind and cash donations to help  people and communities suffering   from the effects of the pandemic. On the next two pages are just a few  examples of how we stepped up as a  force for good in this time of need. In the U.S., we have worked with partners such as  Matthew 25: Ministries, Feeding America, Hispanic Star  and the United Way to get much-needed products  and supplies to those requiring help as a result of the  pandemic, and our focus has been on helping those  communities disproportionally impacted by the virus. We supported efforts through the United Way and  national Red Cross Societies with donations of PPE,  COVID-19 tests, virtual education and food. In Brazil,  hospitals struggled to secure the oxygen needed to  help patients. We funded hundreds of cylinders of  oxygen as a short-term solution and then invested  in a machine to transform oxygen from the air into  medical-grade oxygen to provide a better long-term  solution. This new machine created enough oxygen   to meet the need for all ICU beds in the Santa   Julia Hospital. We joined forces with the International Federation  of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) and  National Societies to scale up health and hygiene  interventions, vaccinations and economic support. We provided more than 13 million P&G products,  helped fund temporary emergency medical  centers and food baskets for the homeless during  Ramadan and Easter seasons. To help vaccinate more than 500,000 Indian  citizens, we pledged funds in partnership with  government and local authorities. We covered  the cost of vaccinations for our 5000+ employee  workforce and their immediate family members,   as well as funded vaccinations for 100 Indians   for every P&G employee we have in India. Hebei and Jilin provinces in China suffered another  outbreak of COVID-19 at the start of 2021. Our Whisper  and Discreet brands supported medical workers on  the frontlines through the donation of Koala and adult  incontinence products. P&G Philippines stepped up to promote health and  hygiene through its partnership with the Philippines  Department of Health and USAID. The nationwide  program promoted safe handwashing and shared  education lessons about home and personal hygiene  practices. We also donated face masks and cleaning  products, including Safeguard soaps, Ariel laundry  detergent, Joy dishwashing liquid and Head &  Shoulders shampoo as part of the 70,000 family   home kits distributed to those in need. We have offered diverse tools to our employees to  help them effectively manage the challenges of  working and living during a pandemic. These include  additional mental wellness and resilience resources,  seminars and apps —and more flexible policies to  support caregiving at home and create the right  balance between work and personal priorities. This year’s events have helped to bring clarity to what matters. Our role as   a company is not only to serve consumers with the products they rely  on to take care of their personal health and hygiene and create healthy  homes, but also to step up to be a force for good in the world. Giving back is rooted in who we are as a company. For more than 180 years,  we have served our communities to help make lives a little better by — And across  our sites, we’re  supporting  our frontline  workers. Through our brands,   people and resources,   we are uniquely positioned   to help restore a sense of   normalcy in communities   impacted by disasters. In the last year, we stepped up  to help in the aftermath of more  than 30 emergencies by — In May, we partnered with Global Citizen on their VAX LIVE   event to encourage vaccination against COVID-19 and  to help make sure vaccines are available to everyone, everywhere to help end the pandemic. During this event, we  announced a $5 million donation to COVAX, a fund established and co-led by GAVI  , the Global Vaccine Alliance,  to help ensure equitable access to vaccines in more than 90 countries throughout Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin  America. With a matching contribution from GAVI, these funds will provide more than two million vaccines around  the world. As part of the VAX LIVE event, Tommy Montoya, HR and Product Supply leader from our   Box Elder plant in Utah, U.S. explained how plant employees at more than 100 manufacturing  sites around the globe have stepped up as a force for good serving consumers as frontline  workers over the past year. He shared what getting vaccinated means for the future in this  30-second clip  . During fiscal year 20–21, we stepped up to help in the aftermath of more than 30 emergencies including: 
• Providing free laundry through the Tide Loads of   Hope program to those in difficult circumstances,   such as residents effected by flooding or tornadoes,   or suffering from the impact of severe, unprecedented  winter weather 
• Providing clean drinking   water and products to those  impacted by hurricanes Eta   and Iota in Central America 
• Partnering with Matthew 25: Ministries to assist   with the recovery efforts from the La Soufrière   volcano eruption on the island of St. Vincent 
•  Stepping up with more than 1.2 million liters of water  through our Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program,   in-kind donations of Safeguard, Ariel and Rejoice and   cash to help those impacted by the cyclones that hit  central Vietnam While the world focused on the pandemic, many preexisting challenges remained for  communities around the world, including the shortage of clean drinking water for nearly   a billion people who struggle each day to have this basic necessity. In 2004, we created the  Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) Program which uses a simple technology that cleans   10 liters of dirty, potentially deadly water in just 30 minutes using a bucket, a spoon, a cloth   and a P&G Purifier of Water packet. Our program has provided more than 19 billion liters2 of clean water in more than 90 countries working closely   with our 150+ partners around the world. CSDW helped Mahia and her family in Honduras recover from the devastating effects of hurricane Eta, and thanks   to our partner Water Mission, the entire family had access to clean water in the aftermath of the hurricane. Pampers and UNICEF began their partnership 15 years ago to eliminate Maternal and   Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) and help make every baby’s world better. MNT is a fatal disease   affecting mothers and babies that can be prevented through immunization and hygienic   birth practices. The partnership journey began with a promise that every time a pack of   Pampers featuring the UNICEF logo was purchased, funding for one vaccine would be   donated to UNICEF. During this time, the partnership has eliminated MNT in 26 countries through the purchase and donation   of more than 300 million MNT vaccines. This effort is estimated to have saved one million newborn lives and  protected 100 million women and their babies, reducing the number of newborn deaths from MNT by 60%. P&G has a long history of giving back to communities and people in need, and that idea of  being part of our local community also remains strong in our hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees and retirees stepped up to support the  Greater Cincinnati annual United Way campaign and surpassed our goal by donating more   than $11 million. These dollars help solve systemic inequities and support signature programs   like Success by 6, Project Lift, Black Empowerment Works, 211 and many others. In addition to monetary contributions, P&G people also stepped up to volunteer their time and effort through   P&G Give Back Days. We created more than 1,600 Notes of Encouragement for older adults across the region   and contributed more than 4,000 items, including school and art supplies, personal hygiene items, shelf-stable   food and more. At P&G, we aspire to create a company and a world where equality  and inclusion are achievable for all; where respect and inclusion are the  cornerstones of our culture; where equal access and opportunity to learn,  grow, succeed and thrive are available to everyone. By being visible in our actions and staying anchored in our commitments   to our employees, through our brands and with our business partners,   we can continue to drive important change around the world. Our commitment to accurately portraying ALL people in  our advertising means ensuring representation, but more  importantly, never stereotyping, never diminishing, never  misappropriating and always trying to reflect unique and  relevant insights to tell authentic stories. We introduced audio description  across the majority of our   advertising in the UK, U.S. and  Spain — opening these ads to over 25 MILLION 6.3 million viewers and listeners  tuned in to this year’s Can’t  Cancel Pride virtual relief  benefit, raising more than 
We introduced Widen The  Screen, a broad creative and  partnership platform to increase  inclusion of Black creators in   the advertising, film, television  and media industries. click here  . 3  Audio description is a separate audio track which includes a description of the visual We are committed to using our voice to drive acceptance, equality and inclusion for all people. In partnership with  GLAAD, we launched The Visibility Project to bring together the world’s top brands and ad agencies working to  advance LGBTQ+ inclusion in ads by providing tools, techniques and resources for industry executives. Through our  commitment of $1 million over the next three years, The Project will act as a roadmap for greater LGBTQ+ inclusion  in mainstream advertising, leveraging insights from GLAAD and P&G’s 2021 “Accelerating LGBTQ Representation  in Advertising”   study and collaborating with the Association of National Advertisers’ Alliance for Inclusive and  Multicultural Marketing (AIMM). This past year, more of our brands leveraged their voices to accurately and authentically drive  LGBTQ+ visibility. We have been consistently recognized externally for this work including  Pantene, who continued their LGBTQ+ journey with #HairHasNoGender   in Europe and  Canada, BeautifuLGBTQ+   in North America, and #PrideHair in Japan. We were humbled   to have our efforts recognized by the leading LGBTQ+ equality organization, Out & Equal,   as the 2020 LGBTQ+ Marketer of the Year. Pride had a different look this year, featuring fewer masks and more in-person celebrations. However, even in the absence of a global pandemic, the LGBTQ+ community faces complex   and significant obstacles every day. On June 4, P&G and iHeartRadio once again joined forces   for the return of “Can’t Cancel Pride,” a virtual relief benefit for the LGBTQ+ community   featuring performances and appearances from influential LGBTQ+ voices and allies in   culture and entertainment. Hosted by iHeartMedia on-air personality Elvis Duran and singer-songwriter Bebe Rexha, the virtual relief benefit  included performances and appearances by Demi Lovato, JoJo Siwa, Lil Nas X, Dolly Parton, Ricky Martin, Troye Sivan,  Elton John, P!NK, Gus Kenworthy, Nina West and many more. Livestreamed across iHeartRadio’s social channels,  Revry and PrideRadio.com, the event drew in 6.3 million viewers and listeners and surpassed its goal to raise more  than $4.2 million to support the LGBTQ+ organizations including, GLAAD, SAGE, The Trevor Project, the National Black  Justice Coalition, CenterLink and OutRight Action International. At P&G, environmental sustainability is embedded in how we do business. We have a  responsibility to make the world better. P&G is committed to positively impacting  our homes, our communities and our planet — especially in the areas of climate,  forestry, water and packaging. We are focused on developing innovations and products that deliver irresistible  superiority in a sustainable way. We continue to reduce our footprint and strive for  more circular approaches in our supply chain. We’re building partnerships with external  organizations to combat some of the most challenging and complex issues we face  today. And our employees are committed to ensure that sustainability is built in —   not bolted on — to their everyday work. In September 2021, we announced a new ambition   to achieve net zero greenhouse gas  emissions across our operations and supply chain, from raw material to retailer, by 2040, as  well as interim 2030 goals to make meaningful progress this decade. We also published a  comprehensive Climate Transition Action Plan  , which outlines our approach to accelerating  climate action and the key challenges ahead. Our science-based plan to net zero will prioritize cutting most of our emissions across our  operations and supply chain, from raw material to retailer. For residual emissions that cannot  be eliminated, we will use natural or technical solutions that remove and store carbon. 4 vs. 2010 baseline 5 per unit of production across priority categories that account for more than 90% of supply chain emissions vs. 2020 baseline P&G is focused on ensuring we do the right  things in the right ways — innovating using  science and nature — for the long term. We see it as our responsibility to ensure no  one has to choose between the products  they use today and the world they want   for tomorrow. P&G and our brands are   committed to using our   voice, reach, innovation and   expertise to make sustainability   irresistible for all. We have provided more  transparency on our website,  launching a portal for investors  and an interactive map that  details our environmental,   social and governance efforts. Tide and Ariel have helped  consumers increase their   use of low-energy laundry  cycles to avoid roughly  
Tide’s Turn to Cold campaign  encourages consumers to switch   to cold water, reducing energy use   in the wash phase by up to 90%. Ariel’s new campaign aims to achieve  a five degree drop in average wash  temperatures in Europe by 2025. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY  IT’S OUR HOME: HOW SMALL ACTIONS AT HOME   CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR OUR PLANET Tide has brought two of the coldest icons in pop culture, Ice-T and Stone Cold Steve Austin,   on board to help convince everyone to #TurnToCold  , as switching from hot to cold water   in a HE top load washer reduces energy use in the wash phase by up to 90% and can save   U.S. consumers up to $74 a year. 10  
For Tide  , the goal is to have three out of four loads of laundry in the U.S. and Canada   washed in cold instead of hot by 2030. This has the potential to reduce GHG emissions   by 4.25 million metric tons (MT), which is the same as removing about one million cars   from the road for a year. 11 Ariel’s pan-European consumer engagement campaign   aims to achieve a five degree   drop in average wash temperatures in Europe by 2025. They have partnered with National  Geographic CreativeWorks on a campaign to highlight the impact of global warming   on the Arctic regions. If European consumers turned down their washing temperatures to 30°C or below, the   carbon dioxide saved would equal removing two million cars from the roads in Europe.

Given increasing stakeholder interest in social issues, climate change and the risks   and opportunities they may present for companies, we launched the ESG Portal   to   provide additional perspective on the actions we are taking in Environmental, Social   and Governance areas. In this portal, you can find out more about our goals, efforts   and progress on water, waste, climate, forestry, equality and inclusion and governance,   among others. As an additional measure of transparency, we have provided more details   on our commitment to the responsible management of forests in our supply chain. We also launched a Mapping Our Impact   section on our public website. This interactive map details our   activities on how we are helping make our home better across forestry, plastic packaging, water and climate. From experience, built over nearly 185 years, we know that a sustainably   strong business depends on maintaining strong ethical, compliance   and quality standards. P&G brands are striving to be a force for growth and a force for good. Serving  five billion people around the world provides a unique opportunity to not only  delight consumers through superior product performance, but also to spark  conversations, influence attitudes, change behaviors and drive positive impact. Brands have a responsibility to society  and the environment. To continue  pushing ourselves to do even more,  we set a goal in 2018 for “100% of our  leadership brands to inspire and  enable responsible consumption”     by 2030. It is a glide path for our  brands to accelerate by integrating  social impact and environmental  sustainability as an essential core   to their strategies and executions. Our brands have a glide path to integrate social impact and environmental  sustainability as an essential core to their brand strategy and execution  by implementing eight ambitious deliverables across product, packaging,  communication, consumer use and supply chain. On the journey to  meeting all 2030 criteria, brands are evaluated against certain milestones  with distinct requirements. Today, 65% of our leadership brands have met milestone one by   defining meaningful and measurable goals for all eight deliverables   and systematically integrating action toward them into their end-to-end  business processes. Moving forward, they will take consistent action to  prove meaningful, sustained progress to achieve a measurable positive  impact on society and the environment. 1 For generations, we have supported consumers, communities and our own  employees through difficult times, while providing many of the products   they count on to take care of their personal health and hygiene, care for   their families and create healthy homes. We committed to do   2,021 ‘Acts of Good’ this   year for our communities,   for equality and for the   planet we call home.

Our operating companies  employ approximately 144,300 employees in virtually all countries of the world, who are engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a  broad range of products in the healthcare field. We work with more than 45,300 suppliers and hundreds of external manufacturers to support the development and  manufacturing of our products worldwide. The Company’s product portfolio includes thousands of Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health products that  address the health and wellness needs of people every day. We are driven by Our Credo, a set of values and principles  that, since 1943, has challenged and inspired us to put the  needs and well-being of the people we serve first. * In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion  of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after the initial announcement. First published in 1943, Our Credo stipulates that paying our fair share of taxes is our responsibility to the communities in which   we live and work. Our tax footprint evolves over time and reflects our healthcare activities and investments, including in research  and development and manufacturing. What does not change or waver is our commitment to good corporate citizenship, which   we demonstrate through sustainable values and behaviors relating to tax governance and controls, compliance, tax planning,   relationships with governmental authorities and transparency, which are more fully described in our  &  Tax Policy. In 2021,  &  contributed approximately $13.1 billion in taxes and fees to governments and economies around the  world. This Total Tax Contribution is made up of two components: Total Taxes Borne by the Company and Total Taxes Collected. Taxes Borne are a direct cost to the Company, whereas Taxes Collected are collected from customers and employees on behalf   of governments and ultimately remitted to them. Our intent is to provide a comprehensive view of total taxes paid around the world. Corporate Income Tax represents   payments in all markets in which we operate and is the amount reported as Income Taxes Paid in the 2021 Annual Report. Other taxes shown aggregate the Company’s data from 22 major markets that represent the vast majority of our revenues. We aspire to include all markets in future years. In 2021,  &  bore $7.2 billion in taxes around the world. The taxes include corporate income taxes, the Company’s  share of payroll and social insurance taxes, and the Company’s share of sales and other taxes. Sales taxes include sales, use, and   non-recoverable value-added tax. Other taxes are primarily composed of customs and other duties such as local taxes and fees  charged to the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, in 2021  &  collected $6.0 billion related to the commerce the Company generates. These collections  were in the form of payroll and social insurance taxes from more than 144,000 employees across the world, sales and use taxes  and value-added taxes. These taxes are collected on behalf of governments and from employees, customers and other business  partners. Total Taxes Collected are an important part of the measure of the contribution made by  &  through job  creation and business activities in the many countries in which we do business. In 2021, society made progress in recovering from a global pandemic while, at  the same time, continuing to grapple with persistent and interdependent global  health, economic, geopolitical and environmental challenges. We are living  through a time when the risks to a peaceful, prosperous global future feel as  urgent as ever. Against this backdrop,  &  sees a greater need for compassion,  innovation and revitalization. Guided by Our Credo—a set of timeless values— our 144,000 employees feel a deep responsibility to deliver on Our Purpose of  blending heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly improve health for everyone,  everywhere. To achieve this aspiration, we are focused on meaningful solutions,  creating impact and collaboration. In my first year as Chief Executive Officer, together with the Executive Committee  and Board of Directors, we are charting our future to evolve and lead through an  increasingly dynamic world. This includes announcing our intention to separate  our Consumer Health business into a new publicly traded company and the  creation of a new  &  with our Pharmaceutical and MedTech  businesses to better serve patients and consumers, accelerate innovation,   and unlock growth. We also continued to deliver enduring impact by formalizing our environmental,  social and governance (ESG) strategy, which frames our ambitions, informs our  execution and creates accountability for our vision of the future. This is supported  by our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals that we all stand behind. Our ESG strategy is organized around three focus areas where we can achieve the  greatest impact: championing global health equity, empowering our employees  and advancing environmental health. This roadmap reflects our long-term goals  to deliver value by helping patients and healthcare providers achieve better  health outcomes, fostering rewarding opportunities for our employees and  suppliers, protecting and strengthening communities, and providing profitable,  sustainable growth for investors. All of this is underpinned by our commitment  to accountability and innovation, as we conduct our business with integrity to  continually earn the trust of those we serve and create value for all stakeholders. Through innovative pharmaceutical therapies, medtech solutions and consumer  health products, we aim to help patients and communities in the greatest need. We see unlimited possibilities in leveraging intelligent automation and data  
science to transform healthcare. We believe that digitization, robotics and cloud  connectivity will result in greater collaboration across healthcare communities   by facilitating sharing of real-world data and delivery of breakthrough medical  care for all. At  & , this approach to innovation is our future and how we will  improve our impact on the world. •  To drive global health equity, we provided our COVID-19 vaccine globally  at a not-for-profit price and shipped 180 million doses of our single-shot  COVID-19 vaccine to the African Union, COVAX and South Africa through  advanced purchase agreements and country donations; we provided  731,000 nurses, midwives and community health workers with skills, tools  and growth opportunities; as part of Our Race to Health Equity, we invested  in culturally competent community care models to close racial health gaps,  reaching 159,000 healthcare professionals and researchers in the U.S.; and we  strengthened local economies by spending $5.22 billion with small and diverse  suppliers, achieving a milestone in our accountable business practices. •  To further empower employees, we refreshed our Enterprise diversity, equity  and inclusion strategy and increased global representation of women and  ethnic, racially diverse employees at all levels of our business while reinforcing   a culture of inclusion and belonging. •  To advance environmental health, in alignment with global climate change  mitigation efforts, we signed the Race to Zero/Business Ambition for 1.5°C  campaign, aiming to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2045, as we further  reduced our carbon footprint by 34%. And as part of our Healthy Lives Mission  and as a signatory to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy  Global Commitment, Consumer Health declared a commitment to reduce total  annual use of virgin plastics in packaging weight by 25% by 2025. We are making strong progress toward achieving our Health for Humanity 2025  Goals. Already, we have exceeded one target and are on track to deliver against  the remaining 20 goals. As we look to the future, 2022 will be another transformative year. Our Purpose  has never been clearer, and our resolve has never been stronger. We are  committed to doing our part, as individuals, as a team and as partners within the  global healthcare ecosystem. It is with an acknowledgment of the major tasks that lie ahead, together with   our determination to succeed, that I invite you to read this Report to learn of   our progress and discover what is yet to come. doses of our COVID-19 vaccine shipped  to the African Union, COVAX and South  Africa through advanced purchase  agreements and country donations

The Foundation operates worldwide as  &  Foundation (founded 1953) and  &  Foundation Scotland (founded 2007). A robust governance structure for environmental, social and governance   (ESG) matters is essential to underpin the long-term success of our Company   and our ability to deliver value for our stakeholders. Our sustainability   governance includes oversight by the Board of Directors, management  accountability, policies and management systems, and published policies   and positions on key ESG topics. The  &  Enterprise Governance Council (EGC) is the   primary governance body for ESG topics and implementation of the   Company’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The EGC comprises   senior leaders who represent our Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer   Health business segments and our global Enterprise functions. In 2021, the EGC also oversaw and supported the Company’s work on   advancing ESG governance through our ESG Strategy and Priority Topics  Assessment (PTA) update. In addition, the EGC engaged regularly with teams  across the Company on core ESG-driven initiatives such as Our Race to Health  Equity and received briefings on our global public health, human rights and  environmental strategies and responsible procurement practices. As sponsors  of priority ESG topics, members of the Executive Committee contributed to all  aspects of our ESG management approach throughout 2021, ranging from our  ESG strategy to risk management and Health for Humanity 2025 Goals progress  oversight. The Board of Directors and its Committees provided oversight at  various points throughout the year. As a global healthcare company,  &  interacts with numerous  stakeholder groups at the global, national and local levels. Ongoing and   proactive engagement with these groups makes our Company stronger   and better informed by: 
Engaging with stakeholders on ESG: The PTA is an important mechanism to  engage with key stakeholders and understand their views on ESG topics they  believe are priorities for  & . In 2021, we conducted a PTA   update that engaged  &  leaders spanning multiple functions   and geographies as well as external stakeholders, including NGOs, partners,  suppliers and customers. Members of both our management team and the Board of Directors met   virtually with many shareholders around the world to discuss our Health for  Humanity sustainability approach and our progress in key ESG measures. We hosted our fourth annual ESG Investor Update webcast in June 2021,  coinciding with the release of our annual Health for Humanity Report. The   webinar provided stakeholders with the opportunity to engage and ask   questions of our business leaders in investor relations; product quality;   medical safety; legal; global public health; and environmental health,   safety and sustainability. Participating in strategic initiatives: To support dialogue and efforts related   to the role of business in society, we continued to participate in important  initiatives like the Council for Inclusive Capitalism with The Vatican, Chief  Executives for Corporate Purpose’s (CECP’s) CEO Investor Forum and Business  Roundtable (BRT). In 2021,  & ’s former Chairman and CEO and  current Executive Chairman, Alex Gorsky, served as Chair of BRT’s Corporate   Governance Committee, while Wanda Hope,  & ’s Chief Diversity,  Equity & Inclusion Officer, chaired BRT’s Diversity and Inclusion Working Group. Engaging with policymakers:  &  engaged in a variety of  forums in the U.S. and around the world to advance policy related to the efficient  and equitable access to medicine. We continue to support the Pharmaceutical  Research and Manufacturers of America in driving patient-centered innovation,  affordability and access alongside advocating for policies that support  biopharmaceutical research and development for patients. In 2021, we sponsored the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s virtual   Health Equity Summit focused on physical and mental health of the Black  community in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Congressional Hispanic  Caucus Institute Leadership Conference plenary session on “Latinos and  COVID-19: Beyond the Vaccine Phase.” 
We also advocated for key pieces of legislation in Congress, including the Black  Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021, and improving data collection processes  and quality measures to better understand the causes of the maternal health crisis  in the U.S. and to inform solutions to address it. &  also joined  more than 70 healthcare advocacy groups in advocating for the Dr. Lorna Breen  Health Care Provider Protection Act, which prioritizes the health and well-being   of frontline health workers. We also ensure that people’s health and well-being are made a core   consideration in all relevant EU policy areas, with appropriate prioritization and  funding for health. In 2021, we supported the proposal for a European Health  Union, the approval of a historic EU budget for health, the creation of Health  Emergency Preparedness and Response (HERA), and the strengthening of key  EU Health Agencies (EMA and ECDC). As the founding knowledge partner  and sponsor of All Policies for a Healthy Europe, we also partnered on the  development of numerous publications and policy dialogues by the coalition  across three thematic areas: the economy of well-being (covering the COVID-19  pandemic response and recovery, health systems resilience, value-based  healthcare, and the EU Beating Cancer policies), the digitalization of health  (contributing our expertise to emerging Data Governance and AI policies), and  environmental health (contributing our expertise to EU Green Deal policies). Engaging stakeholders for this Report: Many internal stakeholders across   & ’s global teams provided input for this Report. The CEO,   the Disclosure Sub-Committee and the Disclosure Committee reviewed the  Report outline and new metrics, and the Disclosure Committee reviewed the   full Report. Our entire Executive Committee reviewed and approved the 2021  Health for Humanity Report, which includes our first year of externally assured  progress against our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, and which we consider   key performance indicators of our ESG performance. Improving our ESG Policies and Positions: We continued to update and improve  our disclosures on key ESG topics in 2021. In particular, we added a Position on  COVID-19 and Intellectual Property Rights. Look for                    throughout   the Report to indicate sections where we   publish supporting ESG Policies & Positions   and click to learn more. Engaging with industry on ESG: Throughout 2021,  &    engaged with the pharmaceutical industry to address the most salient ESG   topics for disclosure and reporting purposes to ensure the expertise of   industry is reflected in the qualitative and quantitative metrics most relevant   to the sector. Efforts with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical  Manufacturers & Associations are facilitated by the Biopharma Sustainability  Roundtable, a network that helps biotech and pharmaceutical executives drive  their sustainability agendas forward. &  is also a member of   the Biopharma Investor ESG Communications Initiative, which was set up to   address the common interest of leading biopharmaceutical companies and  investors in achieving more decision-useful communications about the   sector’s most important ESG issues. In 2021, this Initiative published   Integrating Sustainability and Long-Term Planning for the Biopharma Sector   and participated in several investor engagements to ensure this sector’s voice   is reflected in company ESG disclosures. In particular, our former Chairman   and CEO (and now Executive Chairman), Alex Gorsky, opened CECP’s first   sector-specific CEO Investor Forum in June 2021 in which CEOs of  pharmaceutical and biopharma companies outlined their long-term plans   for value creation. Expanding our ESG frameworks: In 2020, Norges Bank Investment Management  (NBIM) published a guidance note containing a set of indicators that companies  may wish to consider when reporting on the effectiveness of their anti-corruption  efforts to external stakeholders. The indicators cover: culture, risk management,  third parties, compliance function and oversight. In the 2021 Health for Humanity  Report, we have added a disclosure of our performance on anti-corruption efforts  in line with NBIM guidance and indicators. This can be found in the   ESG Disclosure Index. As a member of the Biopharma Investor ESG Communications Initiative,  &   has been engaging in a series of sector-focused direct dialogues between  companies and investors since 2018. •  Recognized by EcoVadis as being in the top 1%   for Sustainable Procurement in the rated   pharmaceutical industry companies 
•  Recognized with a CDP A List rating for leadership   in climate action for the fourth consecutive year 
•  Named to the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate   Political Disclosure and Accountability for the   fourth consecutive year with Trendsetter status 
•  Earned a 100% score in 2021 from the Human   Rights Campaign Foundation and designation of   a “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality” A materiality assessment is a foundational tool used by companies to  identify, prioritize and strategically address relevant ESG topics that  can have a significant impact on society or their business. &   has been conducting such assessments, which we call Priority  Topics Assessments (PTAs) since 2008, and we enhance our PTA  methodology with each assessment. Typically, we have conducted the  PTA every two to three years, but due to the continued world-shaping  events of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial and social events of 2020,  we conducted a PTA in 2020 and again in 2021. In 2021, we aimed to improve alignment with the evolving needs   of stakeholders and keep pace with industry ESG best practices. Building upon our 2019 and 2020 PTAs, we developed an updated   list of ESG priority topics and revised our approach to include the  concept of “double materiality,” in which we examined ESG priority  topics from two standpoints: the impact of a topic on  &  ’s business results and the impact of  & ’s  business on people, the environment and society in general. Given changes made in 2021 to the priority topics assessed by our  stakeholders, a direct comparison between 2021 and 2020 is not  possible. However, in general, we saw similar areas of focus   compared to prior years, with the highest priority topics remaining  in top place, including: consumer health and safety; product quality;  access; and advancing public health. The insights and data   generated from the 2021 PTA refresh served as a critical input into  our ESG strategy. A detailed description of the 2021 PTA process,  methodology and definitions of topics can be found here. Additionally,  the results of the PTA refresh further support the priority areas in   which we set our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals. Disclosure on all   our PTA ESG topics and progress against our Goals can be found in   this 2021 Health for Humanity Report.

As the world’s largest healthcare company,  &  has a unique  ability to apply its expertise and convening power to advance progress on some  of the most difficult global health challenges. We strive to create long-term  social value through delivering innovative medicines, vaccines, treatments and  devices; improving access and affordability; supporting efforts to create stronger  healthcare systems; and helping put a healthy mind, body and environment within  reach of everyone, everywhere. Our commitment to advancing global health equity incorporates our active efforts  and collaborations to enhance access to medical treatment and healthcare for   all people while breaking down historic racial and social barriers that hinder  access to equitable healthcare solutions. Similarly, we contribute to increasing   the resilience and capabilities of health systems so they can improve equitable  access to healthcare for the long term. As a core priority embedded in our ESG  strategy, global health equity is an imperative for  &  and for   our stakeholders. Health equity is the absence of unfair,  avoidable and remediable differences in health  status among groups of people. Health equity  is achieved when everyone can attain their full  potential for health and well-being.2 
We continue to expand our transformational medical  innovation strategy to address additional diseases within  our therapeutic areas, improve our early stage innovation  capabilities and embrace advances in data science  to drive effective, targeted and equitable solutions  to diverse health needs. The COVID-19 pandemic  demonstrated how rapidly the world can be disrupted  by a major health crisis and how systemic inequities can  adversely impact healthcare for all. However, COVID-19  also brought everyone at  &  together to  harness our entire organization, knowledge, resources,  and many longstanding and new partnerships to curb the  pandemic through our COVID-19 vaccine and create a  better, healthier future for all.

Our new Guide to Expanded Access (EA): EA is a pathway that seriously ill  patients may consider in discussion with their treating physicians when they have  exhausted available treatment options and are not eligible for clinical trials. With  varied requirements and processes in every country, there is a burden on patients  seeking information about this potential treatment pathway while also dealing  with a serious or life-threatening diagnosis. To help bridge the information gap,  our Patient Strategies & Solutions team, part of our Global Medical Organization,  published a Guide to Expanded Access. The guide was co-created with patients  and advocates to provide an overview of EA in 28 European countries and Canada  and is available on Janssen.com. We have a longstanding commitment to tackling the toughest health challenges  facing underserved populations in the U.S. and all around the world. We innovate  from the lab to the last mile of care and access, enabled by our dedicated Global  Public Health (GPH) organization. As innovators, we are committed to pioneering  and sustainably delivering meaningful and transformational products in areas  where we believe we can make a profound difference. Working with global and  local partners, we strive to ensure the critical solutions necessary are within   reach of those who need them to save lives, cure patients and prevent disease. • creating access plans for endemic diseases; • improving access to schizophrenia treatments; • reducing the burden of obstetric fistula; and • supporting frontline health workers. The mission of our dedicated GPH  organization is to develop relevant innovations  that save lives, cure patients and prevent  disease and make them available, affordable  and accessible for the world’s most vulnerable  and underserved populations. These Goals are part of our broader aims to address public health that include  improving access to HIV and TB treatments (see sections: HIV and Tuberculosis)  and advancing healthcare for women (see section: Medical Safety). We continuously seek to enhance access to our innovative medicines,   vaccines and medical technologies in all countries—especially for underserved  populations in resource-limited settings within the U.S. and around the world. Specifically, we are active in expanding access to many of our treatments  targeted to halt the spread of different diseases such as HIV, TB, Ebola and  more—see section: Pandemics & Epidemics. As a signatory to the Business for Social  Responsibility (BSR) Guiding Principles   on Access to Healthcare, we collaborate   broadly across our industry to improve   access for patients around the world. Leading the global access ranking: The 2021 Access to Medicine Index (ATMI)  was released in January 2021, and we are proud to again rank as one of the top  three companies advancing access to medicines in low- and middle-income  countries around the world. The recognition of our leadership in this independent  evaluation is the result of a longstanding, deliberate strategy aimed at solving  some of the most difficult global health challenges and advancing equitable  access to care for everyone, everywhere. The ATMI evaluates the world’s  20 largest pharmaceutical companies on their efforts to expand access to  medicines. Each new Index raises the bar for the industry as the global health  landscape changes and expectations for companies evolve. The WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products is designed to  ensure that medicines supplied by procurement agencies meet  acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy. Non-PERC patient engagement: Beyond our structured program for patient  engagement, PERCs, we have experienced an increased demand for stand- alone market research projects that are driven by scientific objectives, where  understanding patient experience is needed to inform internal research strategy. However, we aim to ensure all patient engagement is conducted ethically and  consistently. To this end, we developed a set of Non-PERC Patient Engagement  Guidelines by leveraging existing Market Research Operating Guidelines to  drive standardization across therapeutic areas to integrate patient perspectives  compliantly and efficiently into our work. In 2021, for example, the Non-PERC  Patient Engagement Guidelines were used by our Medical Affairs team in   research to understand drivers of patient satisfaction with TREMFYA   (guselkumab) relative to other therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis. These insights informed internal decisions relating to the design of future  longitudinal, prospective research. Leveraging AI for improved adherence: Adherence is a significant factor in  the efficacy of any treatment regimen. Faced with situations in which a high  proportion of patients fail to fill their first prescription and even more fail to  complete six months of therapy, colleagues at  &  concluded the  
development of an End-to-End Patient Engagement Program. The program is   the first fully digital and AI-based patient journey management solution that  provides real-time insights to activate patients and support prescribers. With this  new tool, we expect to see adherence improvement and reduced delays in the  patient journey. Supporting clinical trial participants: MY TRIAL COMMUNITY is a web solution  cocreated with patients that helps clinical trial participants feel informed,  engaged, secure and better connected. It offers features and benefits to support  trial participants, caregivers and even researchers, including: 
• a dashboard explaining what participants can expect at each visit; •  access to trial-related data during and after the trial to support ongoing   health management; 
• individual clinical trial results; and •  the potential for continuous clinical trial improvement and education   through patient feedback. Advancing patient advocacy and education: In 2021, we continued our HEALTHEVOICES patient advocate conferences, bringing together online   health advocates to learn, share and connect. Our SUPER HEALTHEVOICES  LIVE! event was held over three days with 42 sessions, featuring contributions  from nearly 70 of the most influential online health advocates across a broad  spectrum of health communities and therapeutic areas. We also held our second  series of HEALTHEVOICES for HCPs virtual events, to foster conversation among  professionals in any area of healthcare practice and provide a platform for   sharing insights and learning about new tools that better enable them to   connect with patients online. At  & , we’re using the power of digital and  data to engage patients and customers more effectively  to improve inclusive access, enhance patient experience  and deliver better outcomes. Digital technology helps us  personalize treatments and accelerate improvements in the  standard of care, which is why we are actively integrating   new technologies across our healthcare innovation. Pricing transparency in the United States: In early 2022, we published our sixth  annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report, which highlights information related to  our R&D investment, approach to pricing and patient support programs. Updates  from this year’s report include: 
•  The average net price decline of Janssen medicines in 2021 was (2.8%),*  declining for the fifth year in a row. •  Nearly 55% of the list price of our medicines went to commercial insurers   and others in the healthcare system as rebates, discounts and fees. * 
Active collaboration with patients and caregivers helps guide our decision   making throughout the product lifecycle and accelerate patient-inspired  innovation. We aim to incorporate patients’ perspectives early in the development  of medicines, medical devices and clinical trial protocols, and collaborate with  patients to develop tailored solutions that empower them in managing their  disease or condition. Patient Engagement Research Councils (PERCs): Janssen Scientific Affairs  maintains PERCs covering key disease areas. PERCs are a group of contracted  individuals living with a condition of interest that our scientists can work with to  quickly gather patient insights over time and thereby improve how we research,  design studies and generate information. In 2021, we added the sixth PERC,  covering multiple sclerosis (MS), with a goal of connecting with patients to better  understand and integrate their needs and expectations into study development as  they navigate their MS journey. The MS PERC consists of 12 racially and ethnically  diverse MS patients from various parts of the U.S. We engaged this group to  provide input to our new PONVO trial, a Phase 4, real-world observational study  investigating fatigue in patients living with MS. The PERC for the PONVO study enabled us to directly   interact with patients before the trial started—to gain  insights critical to making the clinical trial experience in  PONVO more manageable and meaningful for participants. For example, we adjusted the frequency of data collection  and the means of collection on the primary endpoint based  on their feedback. * Figures according to Janssen internal financial accounting. ** Data are an approximate number of patients supported by Janssen CarePath provided by the program administrator.  &  has a legacy of  more than 130 years of impacting  human health through scientific  research and innovation. We pursue  breakthroughs in science and  technology in our own laboratories  and through our powerful network of  external scientists and entrepreneurs  all over the world. We combine a  strong internal focus on science and  scientific insight, drug creation, drug  development and strategic value  building, with external complementary  partnerships that have the greatest  potential to fulfill our mission of  improving human health. •  A differentiated research & development engine with excellence in  specific areas of science and medicine, with a focus on data science   as a key differentiator; 
•  Early innovation partnering teams, who seek and cultivate external   innovation opportunities from around the world, aligned with    &  scientific and business priorities; 
•  Building a differentiated and fully integrated R&D data science   team to help discover and develop transformational medicines   and treatment solutions. Recognizing external public health innovation: In addition to recognizing the achievements of  &   innovators, in 2021, we granted a $5 million endowment to Research!America to create an annual award to recognize  individuals and organizations working to make a profound difference in public health. This new category of awards will  be presented annually as part of the Research!America Advocacy Awards Program, now in its 26th year. &   is a founding member of the Research!America alliance, which launched in 1989. This year’s winners include  leaders who are addressing major health challenges, from smoking cessation to diversity in clinical trials to fueling  collaboration to advance solutions for COVID-19. Building on learnings from  the development of our Ebola  vaccine as well as our HIV, Zika  and RSV vaccine candidates,  the team led an ambitious and  unprecedented collaborative  research and development  effort to create a single-shot  COVID-19 vaccine. The team developed Coherent  Mapping, an advancement  in 3D mapping technology  that offers a solution to  assist in the diagnosis of  scar-related complex atrial  arrhythmia. Multicenter study  results overwhelmingly illustrate  the value of Coherent Mapping,  now part of the CARTO PRIME  Module, for physicians as  an integral part of mapping  challenging arrhythmias. The Janssen Oncology team  modified the successful  intravenous immunotherapy  DARZALEX (daratumumab)  to create DARZALEX  FASPRO (daratumumab  and hyaluronidase-fihj), a  subcutaneous injection to  transform the care of patients  with multiple myeloma  with a substantially shorter  administration time of  approximately three to five  minutes compared to the  DARZALEX IV formulation. Working over eight years, the  team optimized a novel peptide,  acetyl dipeptide, that is small  enough to penetrate the skin  and effectively deliver anti- aging benefits such as lifting,  contouring and firming for  consumers, including those   with sensitive skin. Celebrating Our Innovators     Across  & , we celebrate the achievements of our tens of thousands of scientists, researchers, engineers, designers and clinicians who are dedicated  to driving innovation for the benefit of our patients and consumers. The  Medal for Research and Development6 is the most prestigious award given for R&D  excellence within our Company. Since 1960, 423 scientists and engineers from our three business segments have received this award, representing a proud legacy of  innovation at  & . The winning teams of 2021 included 26 innovators who delivered four breakthrough solutions: Data science and digital health are fundamentally changing the face of healthcare. We are building a world class team that is fully integrated with all parts of R&D. We are assembling vast datasets into a data lab, and, in-house or with partners,  developing advanced analytical methods including AI and machine learning, to  analyze these data to solve problems that make our R&D teams more effective and  efficient, and often enable earlier delivery of new possibilities. We are increasingly leveraging data science and digital health to accelerate  innovation at every step of the R&D process to generate insights that allow us to  better understand the diseases we are tackling. For example, data science helps  us determine which compounds show the most promise, bring the best molecules  into clinical development and design, and execute clinical trials more effectively  for exactly the right patients. One major impact of using data science-driven  algorithms can be the earlier detection of disease in patients and determination of  the most suitable medicines, especially for those with progressive diseases. Today,  we have more than 100 data science and digital health projects, powering more  than 90% of our development pipeline. Generating unprecedented data to address multiple diseases: In January 2021,  we became a Founding Industry Member of the Our Future Health consortium,  which aims to collect one of the most comprehensive and most diverse datasets  ever from 5 million volunteers in the UK. &  and other pharma  peers will be able to analyze this dataset to help fuel the early detection,  prevention and treatment of a range of diseases with a higher-than-ever   degree of precision. In another project, progress was made by the UK Biobank, an exome sequencing  data science initiative supported by a consortium of government, charity and  industry members, including  & . In 2021, the Whole Genome  Sequencing (WGS) data for the first 200,000 UK Biobank participants (of a total  500,000) was made available to researchers to enable them to better understand  the role of genetics for health outcomes and potentially advance drug discovery  and development. The dataset will allow researchers globally to study the 98% of  genetic code that is not protein-coded and previously had no known purpose. Enhancing clinical trials: Data science is also enhancing the speed, efficiency   and inclusiveness of our clinical trials. In the early stages of the COVID-19  
pandemic, for example, we were able to gather comprehensive datasets and  leverage advanced analytics to understand how COVID-19 was spreading  worldwide, where it would likely peak next and where the potential for viral  mutations would be highest. These predictions proved remarkably accurate and  enabled us to place clinical trial sites in “hot spots” where participants would  be more likely to have exposure to COVID-19—meaning we could more quickly  determine the efficacy of vaccines. This helped reduce the vaccine development  timeline while generating efficacy data across multiple COVID-19 variants of  interest. This effort, undertaken with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  was recognized with the 2021 Innovative Applications in Analytics Award from  the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS),  regarding the creative and unique application of analytical techniques. Finding early markers of disease: Speed is critical when it comes to identifying  patients and providing the proper treatment, yet for many, rare and difficult-to- detect diseases, diagnosis often comes late—or never at all. For example, for  patients with PAH, the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is two  years, causing delay in treatment and a lower average five-year survival rate. Using the results of echocardiograms, we are applying AI, together with external  collaborators, to help identify early markers of PAH to help change the lives of  those living with the disease. Enabling more targeted therapies: The use of data science helps us select the  optimum therapy for individual patients. For example, we are using AI to analyze  histopathology images from patients with bladder cancer to detect mutations  that may make patients more likely to respond to new medicines and facilitate  recruitment into clinical trials for potentially lifesaving therapies. We are also  leveraging data science to help identify the most appropriate people for our  Phase 3 trial for a vaccine to prevent certain E. coli infections, that are becoming  increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We applied machine learning  to real-world data (RWD) to better understand the patient population and are  using this information to help inform the target profile for participants in our  upcoming clinical trial. Knowledge sharing within  & : More than 1,900  &   colleagues gathered for the third annual 2021  &    Data Science & Intelligent Automation Showcases. This internal, three-day event  highlighted transformational business accomplishments achieved across sectors  and functions throughout the year, some of which are captured in this section. More than 300 colleagues globally shared more than 100 posters and 75 topic- based presentations corresponding to five themed tracks: R&D, Supply Chain,  Commercial, Corporate Functions and End-to-End Integration. With our senior  
Our entire leadership is deeply committed to  leveraging data science and intelligent automation  to change the trajectory of human health. Sharing  knowledge and achievements helps us further  embed this transformational approach across  multiple business functions. We’re already seeing  concrete impact across our pipeline, with much  more to come.

Our Pharmaceutical R&D organization operates at the intersection of unmet  medical need and breakthroughs in science and technology. We work across  a wide range of therapeutic areas and biological pathways to deliver profound  impact, applying our expertise in small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, cell  and gene therapies, RNA therapeutics, and vaccines. Overall,  &   has executed more than 40 acquisitions and licenses and more than 350 strategic  partnerships in pursuit of the best science and solutions to healthcare needs. •  Treatment for a rare form of lung cancer: We received FDA accelerated  approval9 and conditional EMA marketing authorization for RYBREVANT  (amivantamab), the first fully human, bispecific antibody approved for the  treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung  cancer with a genetic mutation called epidermal growth factor receptor   exon 20 insertion. •  First approved treatment in Canada for cardiopulmonary disease: Over the  last two decades, our innovation has helped double the median survival time  of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)10 a rare, progressive disease. Our  latest step in endothelin receptor antagonist treatment for PAH is a fixed-dose  combination pill11 that received approval in Canada in 2021. We are working to  secure this treatment as an option for patients in other countries to reduce pill  burden and improve adherence and outcomes for patients. We received FDA approval for two pediatric indications for XARELTO  (rivaroxaban) for the treatment of blood clots and reduction in the risk of  recurrent blood clots. Clotting is a potentially serious problem in children,  affecting approximately 58 per 10,000 of those hospitalized in the U.S.,   with rates increasing.12 
We are translating immune insights into transformational treatments for patients  across traditional disease area boundaries, broadening our focus from six  anatomy-based diseases to more than 20 immune-mediated diseases.13   
 We are studying a full range of novel oral therapies and industry-first  combination therapies that could potentially benefit millions of people who  suffer from immune-mediated diseases. •  Investigational therapy for a rare neuroimmune disorder: In 2021, we  announced the full results from the Phase 2 Vivacity-MG study of the  investigational compound, nipocalimab (M281),14 in generalized myasthenia  gravis (gMG)—a rare, chronic, autoimmune neuromuscular disease. Granted  Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of gMG, we are also  investigating nipocalimab for rare and autoantibody diseases that span both  neuroscience and immunological diseases. FDA approval for CARVYKTI in early 2022, the first approved cell therapy   for Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of  &  (Janssen),   for the treatment of adults with relapsed and/or refractory multiple   myeloma,7 offering an innovative immunotherapy with the potential to   delay disease progression. •  First approved treatment for light chain (AL) amyloidosis: We received   FDA approval for a DARZALEX FASPRO8 (daratumumab and hyaluronidase  fihj)-based combination regimen for the treatment of patients with newly  diagnosed AL amyloidosis, the first and only FDA-approved treatment for this  rare blood disorder. Scientists at Janssen’s/Legend Biotech’s CAR-T lab in New Jersey prepare a patient’s T  cells to be genetically modified to recognize and fight the blood cancer multiple myeloma. Our mission is to develop and deliver  transformative medicines that positively   impact patients worldwide. With a powerful  future-facing innovation engine and disciplined  R&D strategy, we think equally of science,  unmet need and access—because even the best  treatments can only help those they can reach.  &  MedTech (J&J MedTech) targets some of the world’s   most pressing healthcare challenges across surgery, orthopaedics, vision   and interventional solutions to improve access and quality of care for millions   of individuals. Elevating surgical skills using technology: J&J MedTech uses data science to  generate deep insights and enable solutions powered by predictive analytics,  machine learning and AI to elevate the skill set of surgeons all over the world. In  2021, we continued to scale our C-SATS platform, a cloud-based, AI-powered  ecosystem of knowledge for surgeons that connects the operating room to the  cloud where best practices and surgical techniques are gathered and analyzed. The platform represents insights from a network of more than 375 board-certified  surgical experts to date and helps improve surgeons’ ongoing learning. •  Investigating the next generation of oral anticoagulants: Janssen  and Bristol Myers Squibb, two leaders in thrombosis prevention  and treatment, are collaborating to develop and commercialize  milvexian, a potentially first-in-class oral factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor,  with the goal of improving upon the benefit/risk profile of existing  anticoagulants. The milvexian Phase 2 clinical trial program15  focuses on prevention of blood clots after total knee replacement  surgery and secondary stroke prevention. •  Phase 3 trial for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)  vaccine candidate: ExPEC is one of the leading pathogens in the  AMR crisis. We initiated our Phase 3 E.mbrace study to evaluate  the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of a single injection of our  investigational vaccine to prevent Invasive ExPEC Disease (IED),  such as sepsis, caused by the nine most prevalent serotypes of  ExPEC, in adults aged 60 years and older. •  Phase 3 trial for RSV vaccine candidate: We initiated a Phase  3 trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of  Janssen’s investigational adult vaccine against lower respiratory  tract disease caused by RSV. With no approved vaccine or broadly  indicated antiviral available, millions of older adults around the  world are at high risk of developing potentially life-threatening  illness from RSV. New research on gut microbiome impacts among diverse people:  We entered into a collaboration with Persephone Biosciences, a  JLABS @ San Diego and BLUE KNIGHT company, for the colorectal  cancer arm of a research study evaluating the gut microbiome’s  impact on disease among people of diverse racial backgrounds. Using digital solutions for enhanced imagery: The Visible Patient Planning  Solution is an innovative surgical planning tool that uses patients’ medical  imaging to create a roadmap for surgery by generating an interactive 3D model  for vital organs. Pre-operative procedure planning with Visible Patient enhances  the information available to the surgeon for real-time clinical decision making that  can provide a clearer path for surgery. In 2021, we expanded the Visible Patient  Planning Solution to more than 11 countries in EMEA. Powering insights-driven care across the care continuum: The VELYS Digital  Surgery platform provides a suite of tools and technologies to provide greater  insights for real-time decision making; greater precision and consistency within  the procedure; and an overall more personalized patient care experience before,  during and after surgery. In 2021, we introduced the VELYS Robotic-Assisted  Solution, a first-of-its-kind table-mounted solution, designed to simplify knee  replacement surgery intraoperatively. The FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the  VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution, which is designed for use exclusively with our  ATTUNE Total Knee System. Leveraging robotics across surgery areas: J&J MedTech is pioneering a future of  advanced robotics across several areas of surgery. For example, our MONARCH  robotic bronchoscopy platform is making a meaningful impact on the diagnosis of  lung conditions, particularly in patients with small and difficult-to-reach nodules. Following the FDA’s granting of Breakthrough Device Designation for MONARCH- enabled NeuWave microwave ablation technology, we are continuing to develop  this platform to help make advanced techniques more accessible for hospitals and  extend physician capabilities with the precision of robotics. In 2021 alone, more  than 7,000 procedures were performed using the MONARCH platform. More  than 14,000 procedures were performed since 2019.16 In General Surgery, we are  advancing development of OTTAVA, a robotic-assisted surgery system, which we  believe has the potential to provide optimal surgical outcomes. New possibilities for shoulder surgery: In 2021, we introduced the INHANCE  Shoulder System, a first-to-market, fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system. This is the first shoulder system to offer surgeons the ability to seamlessly  transition from stemless to stemmed implants during surgical procedures based  on real-time decisions that are informed by bone quality and other findings during  the surgical procedure. The pandemic has given us all a deeper  appreciation of healthcare as an investment in  human possibility rather than a burdensome  expense to bear. It has also shown us how  digitization in the healthcare industry can power  a quantum leap forward in innovations that  address unmet needs, elevate the standard of  care and save lives.  Maintaining training and skills: During 2021, in a continuing response  to the mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, J&J  MedTech maintained efforts to support HCPs, including surgeons, with  training and learning platforms accessible without travel. Efforts included:  
•  J&J MedTech Mobile Lab Tours converted buses or trucks used as  mobile training labs so HCPs can safely learn about our products and  get a deeper understanding of how to use them. •  In partnership with OSSO VR, which has developed VR surgical training  modules, J&J MedTech made VR headsets available to surgeons and  academic medical centers throughout the world. •  We introduced a program for remote observation in the  electrophysiology lab designed to simulate the learning experience of  electrophysiologists using a videoconference platform. Web cameras  mounted in the electrophysiology lab allow the observers to see all  stages of the procedure while mapping images, intracardiac echo and  diagnostic recordings are shared on the video screens. •  J&J MedTech partnered with Advances in Surgery and other industry  associations to provide more than 1 million HCPs with online courses   on COVID-19-related professional education ranging from PPE  guidelines to ventilation best practices. &  Consumer Health advances personal health for consumers  every day with products that are rooted in science and endorsed by  professionals. We combine the power of science with human insights to deliver  naturally inspired health and wellness products, high-performance products  for healthy skin and everyday products that deliver effective outcomes for  healthier consumers at every stage of life. Bandages in more skin tones:   BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages  launched OURTONE, a collection of  BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages,  designed to blend with a variety of brown  skin tones, for more inclusive wound care  that embraces the beauty of diverse skin  tones. To develop the OURTONE range,  we listened to consumers, partners and  employees to deliver wound care solutions that better reflect the communities  we serve. For OURTONE packaging development, we worked with company  partners, including Hero Collective—a Black-owned agency committed to  creative projects that amplify Black and Brown voices. More options for acne sufferers: Our new NEUTROGENA Stubborn  Blackheads Serum, available to consumers with no need for a prescription,  is an acne serum with dermatologist-grade ingredients that visibly clears  blackheads while shrinking the appearance of pores, providing visible benefits  to those suffering from acne, including improvement in texture, blotchiness and  post-acne marks. The serum, made with a unique blend of scientifically proven  acids, is strong enough to be effective for mild to moderate acne sufferers and  gentle enough for daily use. A stronger option for cold + flu relief: TYLENOL launched two extra-strength  formulas for day and night treatment to provide relief from painful cold and flu  symptoms, including congestion, cough, headache and fever. Both products  are the strongest TYLENOL formulas available without a prescription, allowing  for expanded access to pain relief for adults and children aged 12 and older  experiencing multisymptom colds. The MONARCH Mobile Lab traveled to more than 20 U.S. cities  educating physicians, surgeons and hospital executives on robotic- assisted bronchoscopy with hands-on experience with MONARCH. The VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution Mobile Experience  completed a 21-week mobile lab tour across the U.S.,   offering hands-on and VR-based education to surgeons,   operating room team members and hospital administrators.

Crowdsourcing to drive innovation:  &  Innovation’s QuickFire  Challenges are crowdsourcing competitions committed to identifying and  cultivating potential health solutions from innovators whose work aims to change  the trajectory of healthcare. In 2021, 16 new QuickFire Challenges were launched  and six Challenges from 2020 were completed. Of the innovative solutions  recognized in 2021, 14 aimed to solve unmet medical need for populations that  have been historically marginalized, and of those awarded funding, 39% were  women-led teams, and 24% were teams led by people of color. As part of these  QuickFire Challenges, we also launched two first-ever innovation challenges that  could benefit the military community, recognizing that many post-active-duty  veterans disproportionately face health issues compared to other Americans. Creating flexible collaborations, deals and investments: Through our Innovation  Centers located in life science hot spots around the world, we collaborate and partner  with external innovators at the early stages of development—including startups,  academics, entrepreneurs and biotech leaders. Since 2013,  &   Innovation has identified, shaped or facilitated more than 1,000 collaborations,  including the following recent examples: 
•  An agreement between Janssen R&D and the National Cancer Center Japan to  profile miRNA biomarkers and understand their role in early stage lung cancer  and tumor formation. Through the collaboration, the groups will be able to assess  results from an East-Asian cohort, which offers the opportunity to bridge the data  between Western and East Asian populations, accelerating identification of robust  biomarkers and facilitating discovery of new treatment targets. •  Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of Anakuria Therapeutics, a company focused  on mTORC1 inhibitors, provides Janssen Pharmaceuticals with a potential first-in- class opportunity to explore solutions for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney  disease, a commonly inherited disorder that causes the kidneys to enlarge and lose  function over time. •  A collaboration between Janssen Oncology and Mersana Therapeutics to enable  the development of up to three novel antibody-drug conjugates targeting cancers in  areas of high unmet medical need. •  An agreement between Janssen Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company  Cidara Therapeutics, one of the JLABS alumni companies, to develop and  commercialize drug-Fc conjugates for the prevention of seasonal and pandemic  influenza. This collaboration could transform the standard of care for patients facing  serious viral infections. •  An innovation developed with  &  Consumer Health and CellScope  to launch SMARTCHECK from Children’s TYLENOL, a digital ear scope that  attaches to a smartphone to enable sharing of recordings of a child’s eardrum  to help provide a remote diagnosis, including a potential ear infection. In 2019,   &  Innovation acquired the rights to the CellScope smartphone  otoscope technology and worked with Consumer Health to bring this innovation to  parents and families. By connecting the best science, technology and  entrepreneurs to our resources, tools and expertise,   we aim to generate transformational healthcare solutions  that address the toughest healthcare challenges and  improve the lives of patients and consumers around the  world. As part of the world’s largest and most broadly based healthcare company, J&J MedTech is transforming the future  of medical intervention and pioneering the next frontier of patient care. By tackling some of the world’s most pressing  healthcare challenges across surgery, orthopaedics, vision and interventional solutions, we work to save lives and ignite all  that’s possible in every body. Through our Ethicon franchise, we deliver surgical technologies, including advanced digital solutions and robotics. At  DePuy Synthes, we maintain one of the most comprehensive orthopaedics portfolios in the world that helps heal and  restore movement for the millions of patients we serve, including joint reconstruction and other specialties. Additionally,  our Cardiovascular, Stroke and Specialty Solutions business provides healthcare providers with tools for neurovascular  care; heart rhythm disorders; ear, nose and throat treatment; and breast reconstruction. Through  &   Vision, we continue to deliver innovation from specialty contact lenses that correct vision and also adapt to changing light  conditions or include an antihistamine to help relieve allergic eye itch to intraocular lenses that deliver the widest range of  continuous vision for cataracts surgery patients (see section: Vision). J&J MedTech is committed to elevating the standard of care in surgery by bringing insights, scale, ingenuity and new  technologies to meet the needs of more people in underserved communities around the world, using our global surgery  capabilities to address healthcare inequities, expand patient access, improve outcomes and reduce health system costs. surgical procedures are  undertaken worldwide each  year; only 6% occur in the  poorest countries, where  more than one-third of the  world’s population lives. About obstetric fistula  It is estimated that more than 2 million young women live  with untreated obstetric fistula in Asia and sub-Saharan  Africa. Obstetric fistula is an abnormal opening between a  woman’s genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum and  is directly linked to one of the major causes of maternal  mortality: obstructed labor. Obstetric fistula is preventable  with improved practices and treatable with timely access  to surgical care. Preventing and managing obstetric fistula  contribute to the SDG 3 of improving maternal health.20 
 &  has also supported the treatment of obstetric fistula since we first donated sutures in the 1980s and we  have continued to donate sutures to health centers and hospitals in Africa for obstetric fistula repair surgeries for many years. Recognizing the continued unmet need for high-quality surgical care, we created a dedicated Global Surgery team as part of  our GPH organization to deliver transformational impact for those suffering with obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa. We have included an important ambition as part of our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals—to help  reduce the number of women suffering from obstetric fistula.19 
 Piloted new surgical instruments in Sierra Leone  to increase patient comfort, maximize surgeon  visibility and improve safety for the patient   and surgeon. Over the last half century, we have developed many innovative treatments for  conditions impacting the brain and central nervous system. Building on this  legacy, we are expanding access to mental healthcare for the world’s most  vulnerable and underserved populations. In addition to our large-scale clinical  study (see below), we continue to support programs that empower frontline  health workers to manage mental illness. Progress: Initiated the CASPAR study assessing the   treatment of schizophrenia with paliperidone palmitate   LAI in Rwandan healthcare settings. To address the urgent need for mental health understanding and services in  Rwanda, in 2018,  & ’s GPH organization partnered with the  Rwanda Ministry of Health to develop a framework for quality, accessible mental  healthcare. Over the past three years, the partnership has trained thousands  of community health workers on the signs and symptoms of mental illness;  conducted the first National Mental Health Survey in Rwanda; and has made  second-generation antipsychotics available, including oral risperidone and  paliperiodone palmitate long-acting injectables (PPLAI). Dr. Rachel Pope performs an obstetric fistula repair surgery using new instruments at the  Freedom from Fistula Hospital in Sierra Leone. Support in Kenya and Tanzania: We supported obstetric fistula procedures and  donated surgical products in Kenya (the Fistula Foundation Treatment Network)  and in Tanzania (the Changing Lives, Changing Communities Comprehensive  Community Based Rehabilitation Hospital and The Mabinti Centre, both in Dar   es Salaam). As a manufacturer of the specialist suture that allows for accurate  repair of obstetric fistula, we aimed to ensure continuity of supply of sutures  to rural areas, allowing obstetric fistula repairs to continue, even during the  COVID-19 pandemic. Trialing new surgical instruments in Sierra Leone: In 2021, we trialed new  surgical instruments for obstetric fistula at the Freedom from Fistula Hospital   in Sierra Leone, treating patients with new fistula scissors and a suture/catheter  organizer. These improvements aim to provide high-quality instrumentation to  increase patient comfort, maximize surgeon visibility, and improve safety for  both the patient and the surgeon. By reducing cost and surgery time, the goal  is to develop a sustainable sourcing model in resource-limited settings. This  development was progressed in collaboration with Dr. Rachel Pope, Assistant  Professor, Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center,   as part of our initiative to develop or improve three surgical instruments used   during fistula surgery. Having received positive feedback from surgeons,   the new instruments are planned for use in Kenya in 2022. In March 2021, we partnered with Medical & Surgical Skills Institute  (MSSI) to provide a two-day obstetric fistula panel, attended by 500  medical professionals from across sub-Saharan Africa, including  obstetric fistula surgeons, physicians, nurses, midwives and medical  officers. This interactive virtual event was the first time a world-class  panel of experts had been pulled together to address key aspects of  fistula prevention, repair and rehabilitation in Ghana. The MSSI in Accra, Ghana, was  established in 2005 by  &   and other partners, including  the West Africa College of Surgeons,  and has become a center of excellence  for advanced healthcare training  in West Africa, providing hands-on  medical and surgical skills training   in advanced trauma, including  childbirth injuries. •   &  contributed to the mid-2021 publication of the  UK’s Life Sciences Vision, providing expertise in relation to mental  health and dementia as well as other health challenges. •  We maintained our support for the World Dementia Council and   co-led a workshop on dementia prevention and care in 2021. Healthy Brains Global Initiative (HBGI) and co-chairmanship of the   Use of Proceeds working group by Dr. Husseini Manji, Global Head,   &  Science for Minds. HBGI was established in 2020  as a nonprofit aiming to mobilize $10 billion for brain health research   to benefit people living with neurological and mental health disorders. •  We are closely involved with the NIH Novel and Exceptional  Technology and Research Advisory Committee (NExTRAC), which  helps shape new initiatives focused on data science and emerging  technologies. & ’s Dr. Husseini Manji was appointed   to NExTRAC in 2021. Beyond the data to be generated, the study is also helping strengthen critical  research capacity in resource-limited settings by providing local Rwandan clinical  staff with valuable training related to the conduct of mental health research and  Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Our efforts included a dedicated training program  for local staff, developed and delivered with the help of the European Centre for  Clinical Research Training. The launch of the CASPAR study represents the latest  step in our commitment to generate evidence that will inform adoption of PPLAI  as a treatment option for schizophrenia. Supporting mental health workers: As part of our strategic collaboration with   the Ministry of Health of Rwanda, we co-developed a unique, phone-based mental  health training program on the signs and symptoms and referral process for  common mental health disorders for more than 50,000 community health workers  in Rwanda. Implementation of this study was found to be feasible and acceptable  as a training platform in a new study published in Frontiers in Public Health. The  training program results support the expanded usage in LMICs. •  FDA approval of INVEGA HAFYERA (six-month paliperidone   palmitate), the first and only twice-yearly treatment for adults with  schizophrenia, offering patients the fewest doses per year for a life   less defined by schizophrenia medication; 
•  European Commission approval of BYANNLI (six-month  paliperidone palmitate, trade name INVEGA HAYFERA in the U.S.)  for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults; and  
•  the addition of once-monthly paliperidone palmitate INVEGA  SUSTENNA/XEPLION LAI treatment for adults living with  schizophrenia to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML). Advancing a digital mental health solution in China: Our agreement with the  digital health and data analytics company, Holmusk, to explore the development  of a digital mental health strategy in China, yielded initial results in 2021 with the  granting of regulatory approval for mConnect, a patient-centric digital health  solution for major depressive disorder. We worked with Holmusk to localize the  
As a member of NExTRAC, I am involved in defining and  characterizing the kinds of research that will require   gathering data about individuals using emerging technologies,  considering both the benefits and risks. These insights will help  define future initiatives, informed by stakeholder input,   to ensure that data science progresses in a responsible manner  and respects the privacy of individuals. In low- and middle-  income countries,   more than 75% of   people with mental  disorders receive no  treatment at all for   their disorder.22 
Facts about Mental Health app, and in November 2021, it made its debut in the Apple store for download and  use by patients and clinicians. Use of the app will support targeted management of  wellness-oriented consumers as well as mental health patients. First interventional clinical study of schizophrenia in Africa: Building on this  momentum, in 2021, we commenced our Clinical Study to Assess the Treatment  of Schizophrenia with Paliperidone Palmitate in Rwandan Healthcare Settings  (CASPAR), the first interventional clinical trial for schizophrenia in Africa. The  study is assessing the impact of the PPLAI antipsychotic treatment in patients  with schizophrenia in real-world healthcare settings. &  is collaborating with the Government of Rwanda to help  improve access to care for those suffering from mental illness in the country.

More than two out of three people with psychosis in  the world do not receive specialist mental healthcare.23  &  Vision aims to help people see better, connect better, live  better. We activate and advance innovations to protect, treat, cure and support  every person’s lifelong journey of healthy sight. Across the world, we collaborate  to expand access to quality eye care in communities with the greatest need. At  &  Vision, we have a bold  ambition to redefine healthy sight for life. People  value sight above all other senses—it’s how we learn  and how we connect. Yet, two billion people right  now are living with vision impairment—more than  half of which could have been prevented or has yet to  be treated. This is what motivates our teams around  the world every day. Together, we’re protecting sight,  optimizing sight, restoring sight. and of these, at least 1 billion people have a vision impairment  that could have been prevented or is yet to be addressed. &  Vision continues to deliver new vision solutions from  specialty lenses to innovative surgical equipment for the most advanced vision  procedures. The shift to digital platforms has created a rapid increase in vision  demands. To meet these needs,  &  Vision developed its  most advanced intraocular lens (IOL) using its TECNIS platform, a proprietary  combination of materials and design for IOLs that was pioneered 20 years ago. The TECNIS SYNERGY is a presbyopia-correcting IOL that combines the best  of extended depth-of-focus and multifocal technologies to deliver the widest  
Beyond product innovation (see section: Innovation in  Practice), examples of our activities to advance eye   health and care in 2021 included: 
Contact lenses for managing myopia: In 2021, the FDA approved ACUVUE  ABILITI Overnight Therapeutic Lenses, the first and only FDA-approved  orthokeratology contact lens for managing myopia. The approval is the result  of a collaboration between  &  Vision and Menicon and  represents a breakthrough in helping patients and eye care professionals  address the progression of myopia. range of continuous vision without the visual gaps caused by existing multifocal  technology. For example, ACUVUE THERAVISION with Ketotifen contact lenses,  which were approved and launched in Canada and Japan in 2021, and in the U.S.  in 2022, are the world’s first and only drug-releasing contact lenses for vision  correction and allergic eye itch. For cataracts, we have developed the broadest  global portfolio of intraocular lenses to offer patients continued freedom from  wearing glasses.

EDB supports  &  Vision’s commitment   to pioneer an integrated eye health ecosystem and elevate  the standard of care for eye health. This project provides  exciting job opportunities in Singapore for digital talent and  reinforces Singapore’s position as a leading innovation hub  for digital health. Addressing unmet needs in cataract surgery: We expanded the availability of   our next-generation cataract surgery globally, offering more surgeons, patients  and healthcare systems around the world the possibility of better health  outcomes. The VERITAS Vision System is an advanced phacoemulsification  (phaco) system designed to address three critical areas of cataract surgery:  patient safety, surgeon efficiency and comfort. Phacoemulsification is the most  common cataract surgery technique25 and allows surgeons to effectively emulsify  and efficiently remove the eye’s internal lens when it has become cloudy from  cataracts. The equipment that surgeons can rely on in performing the   procedure is critical to optimizing the circumstances for surgical success. Working with global partners to improve eye care access and quality:  Longstanding strategic partners that we engage with to advance our mission   to change the trajectory of eye health include: 
•  HCP Cure Blindness: Dedicated to reaching the most unreachable patients,  HCP Cure Blindness envisions a world in which no person is needlessly blind. The organization cultivates the growth of local, sustainable eye care systems  and outreach events to ensure access for all to high-quality, cost-effective   care in underserved areas of the world. &  Vision supports   its efforts to bring life-changing care to more than 20 countries across South  Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In June 2021, in honor of World Cataract Day,   &  Vision teams led a company-wide campaign to raise  awareness and funds for HCP Cure Blindness to help reach more people  affected by blindness and lack of access to care. New integrated eye health ecosystem in Singapore: In line with Singapore’s  Smart Nation initiative,  &  Vision established a three-year  roadmap of initiatives designed to establish Singapore as the regional hub for  eye health innovation, supported by our expected investment of SGD 10 million  over three years. Rooted in a new, integrated eye health ecosystem, our efforts  will support the delivery of a new standard of eye care by improving access,  capacity and personalization of patient care. Further, with a focus on data and  digitalization, this initiative aims to foster up to 40 local eye care professionals   in leadership positions with the support of the Singapore Economic   Development Board. •  Sight for Kids (SFK): Since 2002, Lions Clubs International Foundation has  collaborated with  &  Vision to implement the largest-known,  school-based eye health program, SFK. This innovative program mobilizes eye  care professionals and volunteers to provide comprehensive eye health services  to students in low-income schools across North America, Asia and Africa. In  2021, SFK was expanded to the U.S., in collaboration with the Florida Heiken  Children’s Vision program (a division of Miami Lighthouse for the Blind and  Visually Impaired), to bring comprehensive eye health services and treatments  to approximately 20,000 South Florida students experiencing inequities in  access to eye health care.26 In addition to pro bono eye exams and eyeglasses  provided in compliance with COVID-19 safety guidance from the CDC and  the American Optometric Association, program participants will also receive  educational eye health materials, available in four languages to meet the needs  of these diverse communities. Smoking cessation programs: In 2021, we increased our support for smoking  cessation during the COVID-19 pandemic by extending our partnership with the  WHO through the Access Initiative for Quitting Tobacco. Following our 2020  partnership in Jordan to support 5,400 smokers to quit, in 2021, we advanced a  further partnership in the Philippines to support an additional 4,500 smokers. As  part of these partnerships, we have donated more than $1.5 million worth of  NICORETTE patches.

Improving product transparency: In September 2021, JOHNSON’S Baby  launched our first-ever consumer-facing product transparency dashboard with  product-specific ingredient and environmental information for the brand’s 10  highest impact products in the U.S. market. &  Consumer Health  developed and launched the dashboard to help consumers make more informed  choices about personal care products after conducting extensive qualitative  research to better understand their unique expectations of the brand and engaging  consumers to co-create the tool with us through a real-time design process. This  milestone will pave the way for our other Consumer Health brands to implement  product transparency in a way that is simple and compelling for consumers. Building on this successful first initiative, we have a strong foundation to scale  product transparency in 2022 to more brands and markets around the world. Skin cancer prevention: We created In the Sun, Neutrogena Studios’ first-ever  documentary film to elevate awareness and understanding of skin cancer for  all skin types and colors. Skin cancer rates, including rates of melanoma, have  continued to increase in the U.S. and worldwide.27 Practicing sun safe habits, such  as seeking shade, wearing protective clothing and increasing use of sunscreen,  can help reduce this trend and help consumers live life safely and vibrantly in  the sun. To raise awareness across a wide population, NEUTROGENA founded  “Neutrogena Studios” and partnered with Executive Producer Kerry Washington  to produce an inspiring, unbranded documentary that shares the skin health  journeys of seven families facing extraordinary circumstances as they uncover  the long-term effects of living in the sun. The response to the documentary has  been beyond expectation: In the Sun was included as an Official Selection of  16 film festivals and named the “Best Environmental Documentary” at the 2021  Seattle Film Festival. More than 8.2 million people have viewed the documentary,  in addition to 125,000 school students who participated in in-school learning  programs across the U.S. Feedback indicates that many viewers are likely to wear  sunscreen consistently and/or do a skin self-exam as a result. NEUTROGENA  also engaged in a first-of-its-kind collaboration to use the documentary to train  thousands of Walgreens beauty advisors on skin cancer prevention. Monique Mack (left) shares her journey as a child, how her mom, Aurelia Mack (right),   helped her through it all and why it motivates both of them to keep their family safe.

•  A*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering Circular Materials  Lab, a collaboration to identify circular flexible film packaging solutions. Our Healthy Lives Mission guides our Consumer Health brands to take action to  advance health—for people at every stage of life, for communities around the  world and for our planet. By taking concrete action to design more sustainable  products and packaging, not only do we provide consumers with personal health  solutions that meet their evolving expectations, but we live into our commitment  to operate increasingly more sustainably and significantly reduce the planetary  impact of our operations and our products. •  Reduce our total annual use of virgin plastics in packaging weight by  25% compared to 2020, achieved through a combination of recycled  plastic, plastic packaging reductions and more reuse models. Increasing our use of sustainable packaging: We are advancing our Healthy   Lives Mission by taking important steps to reduce the environmental impact   of our personal care product packaging—using less virgin plastic, using more  recycled materials and ensuring our packaging is easier to recycle or reuse. As a signatory to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy   Global Commitment, we declared a commitment that by 2025, we will reduce  our total annual use of virgin plastics in packaging weight by 25% compared  to 2020. This goal will be achieved through a combination of increased use of  recycled plastic, plastic packaging reductions (elimination, substitution, etc.) and more reuse/refill models. We couldn’t be more excited to pilot this new tool on  JOHNSON’S. Consumers have told us how important  product transparency is to them, but it can be difficult to  navigate the sea of information that is out there. This is   a simple, visual, one-stop shop for product-level detail. I wish something like this had been available when my  own kids were babies and I was researching products   for them. It would have made things so much easier! In the first year since the launch of Our Race to Health Equity (ORTHE) platform, a  $100 million five-year U.S. commitment to help eradicate racial and social injustice  as a public health threat by eliminating health inequities for people   of color, we have been working to create meaningful change through three  priority areas:28 
1. Creating a people-first culture: We are committed to cultivating a diverse and  inclusive workforce and achieving ambitious goals to increase ethnic/racial  diversity across our organization, including at management levels (see section:  Our Employees). To support these goals, we have strengthened partnerships  with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving  Institutions (HSIs), among others. 2. Building healthier communities: We are committed to closing the racial health  gap by investing in culturally competent community care models that create  healthy outcomes for people of color. Working with various partners, we aim to  help build trust between minority communities and health systems, backed by  our commitment to supporting 200,000 HCPs and researchers by 2025. In 2021, we supported 11 health clinics as   part of the National Association of Community  Health Center’s Workforce Development   Grant Program and partnered with the  Foundation of the National Student Nurses’  Association to increase nursing scholarships  for underrepresented groups. We further  supported 27 partner organizations and  projects focusing on community health  workers and health centers that serve  people of color. We also created a   six-episode video series, hosted by Michael  Sneed, now retired Executive Vice President  Global Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer,  & ,  featuring conversations with Black doctors and nurses on the front lines of health  equity across the U.S. In 2021, entrepreneurs, innovators, startups and community- based organizations were invited to submit their ideas for  transformational innovation to advance health equity in six cities  where Black and Latinx communities face significant disparities  in health outcomes: Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Orleans,   New York and Philadelphia. With $1 million in available funding,  &   called for ideas that enhance equitable access to care,  stimulate diversity in science, advocate for more trustworthy  community-based healthcare, and prevent and treat illnesses  that disproportionately affect Black and Latinx communities. More than 180 applications were submitted and evaluated  by an independent judging committee, and awardees will be  announced in 2022. 3. Establishing enduring alliances:  &  is partnering with  universities, health systems, NGOs and governments to build coalitions to  develop and expand programs that help close the health gap for people of   color. To support the creation of a next generation of diverse physicians,   & , along with Janssen, strengthened our 20-year partnership  with the National Medical Fellowships (NMF), a nonprofit dedicated to  increasing diversity among U.S. physicians. With our support, NMF introduced  an inaugural class of 25 physicians into the NMF Diversity in Clinical Trials  Research program to increase the number of underrepresented minority  clinicians who serve as lead research managers or principal investigators. •  Research: Investments with partners to conduct research to better  understand and raise awareness for health disparities impacting  communities of color. •  Frontline health worker representation: Scholarships and other non- financial support funding for a range of professional healthcare and  advocacy organizations to help increase the representation of people  of color in medical, scientific and health professions. •  Community-based healthcare solutions: Funding to support  community-based healthcare solutions that improve quality of and  access to care for people of color. •  Advancing climate solutions and health equity: Support leading  organizations that are addressing the disproportionate impacts of  climate change on the health of communities of color. For example,  working with the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health  and the National Medical Association, we created the pioneering  Climate and Health Equity Fellowship to support physicians of color  to become leaders in climate and health equity education, advocacy,  and policy solutions. We also supported 20 full scholarships for  students of color to attend the first-ever Youth Summit on Climate  Change & Health that was hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School  of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health and the Global  Environment (Harvard Chan C-CHANGE). Boosting diversity in clinical trials: We share the concern about the historic  underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, and  Janssen has taken specific steps to (1) advance internal awareness on the  need to successfully recruit underserved and underrepresented patients and  apply new tools to increase enrollment of diverse populations in our clinical  trials, (2) increase underserved and underrepresented populations’ access to  participation in clinical trials through various internal and external initiatives  that address barriers to enrollment, and (3) improve awareness and education  about clinical trials in underrepresented populations to facilitate greater trust  and participation in clinical trials. Driving innovation: For example, we encourage innovation through our  QuickFire Challenges that invite ideas from diverse groups with the aim to  solve healthcare challenges to create equitable and inclusive healthcare  systems (see section: R&D Innovation). In 2021, we launched an innovative program in the UK to help drive a more  diverse healthcare workforce and provide young people with opportunities to  pursue a career in STEM. The  &  STEM Scholars Programme  was created to support Black students studying STEM in further education. The five-year program is championed by the  &  Innovation  Centre in London and supports 25 students for two years, and a cohort of 10  students for a further three years during their time at university. The program  aims to build understanding of the healthcare industry and STEM careers and  will enable students to gain experience through work placements and paid  internships at  &  UK locations, supported by a  &   mentor. Advancing health equity though MedTech: At  &  MedTech,  we use our role as a MedTech leader to address health disparities and promote  health equity solutions across surgery, orthopaedics, interventional solutions  and vision. We aspire to reach more than 1 million HCPs through partnerships  with the Society of Black Academic Surgeons, Advances in Surgery (AIS) and  others to execute training initiatives focused on addressing disparities   in healthcare. •  Supporting a two-year scholarship and mentorship program for diverse  medical students in the U.S. conducted by the NMF; 
•  Partnerships with the NMF Diverse Clinical Investigator Training Institute   with MedTech Color to increase patient diversity in clinical trials; 
•  Training sessions for HCPs on healthcare diversity, in collaboration with AIS  and the American College of Surgeons (with more than 60,000 participants  from 150 countries having attended the training); 
•  Launching an initiative to drive change in stroke care, starting with the  collection and analysis of data and insights needed to identify and drive the  change in closing the disparity gap associated with stroke care; and 
•  Helping publish, as a member of AdvaMed, industry-wide principles on  health equity and engaging regularly with the FDA and other groups to  advocate for communities of color. At  &  UK, a key priority is to invest  in the next generation of healthcare talent and to  ensure that young people everywhere have the  opportunity to fulfill their dreams, regardless of  their ethnicity, background or circumstances. This  programme will help build a more diverse talent  pool for  &  and create a stronger  and more resilient healthcare workforce. Also in 2021, J&J MedTech continued its My Health Can’t Wait program in the  U.S. and around the world. My Health Can’t Wait is a global education initiative  and online resource to encourage patients and HCPs to access and provide care  safely during the pandemic and beyond. The program provides resources to help  HCPs and patients reengage in meaningful conversations about how and when to  get the right medical treatment. In 2021, we launched a localized My Health Can’t  Wait pilot program, focusing on underserved communities in Chicago, informed  by research that indicates that Black and Hispanic adults deferred care at higher  rates throughout the pandemic, reinforcing the inequities facing communities  of color in the region. Through both initiatives, we were able to reach millions of  individuals with resources that can guide them to receive the healthcare   they need. &  Vision is the first major   eye health company to sign the 13% Promise,  an initiative created by nonprofit Black  EyeCare Perspective to increase equity and  representation in optometry to mirror the 13%   of Black people in the U.S. population. To learn more about our efforts to advance DEI across our  organization and through our business activities, see also our third  annual DEI Impact Review. At  & , we contribute to advancing health and well-being in the  communities in which we live and work. Our GCI organization, through funding  from the nonprofit  &  Foundation and other operating companies  across  &  business segments and functional organizations, drives  programming for our community giving, social impact and other initiatives around  the world. In 2021, GCI built on existing work with expanded and new programs. Established in 2019 and equipped with a $250 million, 10-year  commitment from the  &  Foundation and the   &  Family of Companies, the Center for Health  Worker Innovation carries forward our longstanding focus on  frontline health workers as essential to solving all health challenges. The Center is committed to supporting one million frontline health  workers, specifically nurses, midwives and community health  workers, projected to reach 100 million people by 2030. In 2021,  with an additional $50 million commitment toward our COVID-19  response, the Center worked with partners around the globe to   help build resilient, community-based health systems while   adapting and responding to the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering for collective impact: The Center for Health Worker Innovation  supported the launch of the Kenya Community Health Strategy, a multistakeholder  coalition to strengthen community health led by the Kenyan Ministry of Health. The strategy aims to formally integrate community health workers into the health  system. This strategy co-creation model was also launched in South Africa with  the national Ministry of Health to help transform the health system by supporting  community health workers with accredited training, advancing a digital health  system and updating government policy. Helping health workers manage stress: To support health workers in managing  stress, exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Center for Health Worker  Innovation launched The Resilience Collaborative, a global learning community  connecting more than 400 people from 200 organizations across 34 countries  to advance learning and drive adoption of evidence-based strategies for health  worker resilience, particularly in low-resource settings. The Collaborative’s Toolkit  and other resources have been accessed by more than 100 organizations. Harnessing digital health: The Center for Health Worker Innovation supported   the digital training of hundreds of thousands of frontline health workers on  COVID-19 response and vaccination through a range of partners, including   the Western Catholic Educational Association, Reach52, VillageReach,   Praekelt.org and UNICEF. Additionally, content developed by UNICEF, the  COVID-19 Digital Classroom Consortium and WHO was adapted for different  mobile-first channels and made freely available for use by organizations around  the world. We also supported other digital initiatives that provided real-time   alerts, vaccine registrations and other tools, reaching millions of people globally. Building community health worker capability in China: More than 180 million  elderly people suffer from one or more chronic diseases in China, accounting for  75% of this population.29 In October 2021, the Center for Health Worker Innovation  partnered with China Primary Health Care Foundation to launch the Community  Health Worker Capability Building for Elderly Common Disease program in China. The program aims to help community health workers improve their capability to  manage common diseases among the elderly and improve the quality of public  health service. The program has committed to train 4,000 community health  workers and benefit 400,000 residents in communities or villages each year for  five consecutive years. The project will initially focus on disease management of 
cataract and atrial fibrillation, two common chronic diseases in the elderly. In addition, the program will carry out nationwide health communication  campaigns to enhance the public’s awareness of prevention and treatment   of common chronic diseases among the elderly. Boosting resilient community-based health systems: As part of our advocacy  work to support frontline health workers and build resilient community-based  health systems, we progressed several collaborative initiatives, including: 
•  Partnered with Women in Global Health to create the Fit for Women—Safe and  Decent PPE for Women Health and Care Workers Report, a global research  report to document the challenges frontline women health workers faced during  COVID-19, as most medical PPE are not designed for women’s bodies;  
•  Collaborated with global sustainability nonprofit Forum for the Future to create  a report covering resilient community health systems of the future, including  lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic;  
•  Contributed to the publication of the “State of the World Midwifery Report  2021” and Emergency Obstetrics and Newborn Care e-learning modules; 
•  Commissioned the first-ever mobile, modular museum, Micro Museum of Care,  that explores caring for one another told through the stories of frontline health  workers. The Museum of Care will reside first in the New York City public library  system through spring 2022; and  
•  Collaborated with the Financial Times (FT) and our partners to produce a series  of articles that explore and build awareness of the challenges and opportunities  facing the global health workforce through stories of individual health workers  based in different parts of the world and their real-life experiences. The Center  also supported the development of an FT special report, Delivering Healthcare,  looking at challenges facing the world’s health systems and how to solve them. Another channel through which we aim to   help transform healthcare in our communities   is  &  Impact Ventures,  a  &  Foundation initiative to  develop a global portfolio of impact startups  and social ventures, with a focus on low- income and diverse communities. In October  2021,  &  Impact Ventures  announced a $50 million investment from  the  &  Foundation to be  allocated to innovative financing for health  impact entrepreneurs to improve healthcare in  communities around the world. To date,    &  Impact Ventures portfolio  companies have reached 1.8 million lives.31 
 &  has supported the nursing profession for more than 125  years because we believe nurses are the backbone, lifeblood and heart of  health systems worldwide. COVID-19 Vaccine Facts for Nurses (CVF4N) digital campaign: To help  nurses educate themselves and prepare them to inform and counsel their  patients and the communities they serve, we provided support to the  American Nurses Association (ANA) to launch CVF4N. The campaign was  developed in collaboration with 22 nursing organizations to identify evolving  questions about COVID-19 vaccinations and provide culturally relevant, critical  information and expert perspectives about the safety, efficacy and importance  of vaccines. The campaign included webinars, town hall meetings, videos,  infographics and diverse social media content, and a website. Nurses across  the country engaged widely with the campaign and at its conclusion at the end  of 2021, an ANA survey indicated that nurses’ confidence in vaccine safety and  effectiveness had risen to 75% over the course of the year.30  
Accelerating nursing, transforming healthcare research:  &   partnered with the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL)  and the ANA to conduct a large-scale research study examining the impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nursing workforce as a way to extract key  learning, spotlight exemplars and help chart a progressive path forward for  the nursing profession. This work led to the publication of four papers in July  2021, a webinar and conference presentations. While the adverse impacts of  the pandemic on nurses is well documented, we found that the urgency of the  pandemic removed longstanding barriers for the profession, enabling nurses  to step up and lead in new roles and innovate in new settings, indicating clear  opportunities for nurses to continue to help transform healthcare in new ways  in the future. At  & , we use our scale and resources for good, contributing to  many causes around the world to help advance health and improve people’s lives  by providing funding, products, nonprofit support and engaging our employees  in volunteer efforts in our communities. Our giving is primarily executed through  the  &  Foundation, a registered charitable organization that is  funded solely by the  &  Family of Companies. The Foundation  operates worldwide as  &  Foundation (founded 1953) and   &  Foundation Scotland (founded 2007). These independent  entities support both global and in-country partnerships and initiatives,  opportunities for employee engagement, and disaster response activities  managed by the GCI organization at  & , including the Center  for Health Worker Innovation, Our Race to Health Equity platform and    &  Impact Ventures. We maintain several global partnerships and platforms that advance healthcare  and the quality of life for patients, consumers and communities. We continue to  engage with the following organizations: 
•  Save the Children, a longstanding partnership supporting a range of programs  such as newborn survival, support for refugees, response to humanitarian crises  and joint advocacy; 
•   &  One Young World Program, a partnership since 2013 to  provide young leaders in healthcare with opportunities to contribute to solving  health issues; and 
In the U.S., we also support independent initiatives by donating medicines   and funding to the  &  Patient Assistance Foundation, Inc.  (JJPAF), an independent nonprofit committed to helping eligible patients   without insurance coverage receive prescription products donated by    &  operating companies. allocated in support for the  immediate, mid- and long- term response, as well as  readiness, to natural disasters  around the world. We continue to work with trusted partners, including Americares,   Heart to Heart International, the Catholic Medical Mission Board, MAP  International, MedShare and International Health Partners, on the front lines  of care by coordinating product donations and supporting programs that  help communities recover, rebuild and become resilient. In the immediate  aftermath of major disasters, our response includes providing essential  Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health products as well as  monetary donations and other support.32

It’s our first line of support to those  impacted by disasters around the world. Photo by Heart to Heart International. A family impacted by disaster receives a  &  Hygiene Kit. Photo by Heart  to Heart International. In 2021, we supported communities impacted by   disaster, in addition to our continued support for   regions affected by new waves of the COVID-19   pandemic. Examples include: 
•  Winter storm in Texas: Winter storm Uri in February 2021 caused   blackouts for more than 5.2 million homes and businesses in Texas   resulting in hundreds of fatalities. We provided funding to the H-E-B   Spirit of Giving Fund to support those without power with food, water and  cleaning supplies. •  Earthquake in Haiti: Thousands of people lost their lives and many more were  injured in the earthquake that struck the Southwestern part of Haiti in August. &  donated 5.4 million doses of VERMOX, our medicine for  intestinal worms, and three DePuy Synthes small fragment fracture sets for  long bone fracture management to help Haitians in need access essential  supplies and medicines and respond to the acute surgical needs of those  injured in the disaster. •  Hurricanes in the U.S. and Mexico: We continued our support for Medical  Brigades that were active in recovery efforts resulting from Hurricane  Grace in Mexico and supported AIDS United in its efforts with vulnerable  populations following the havoc wreaked in the U.S. by Hurricane Ida. •  Western Kentucky tornado:  &  provided key partners  working on the ground with mobile medical units and other facilities for  healthcare providers to help communities recover from the violent Western  Kentucky tornado. •  Wildfires in Turkey: In the aftermath of raging fires affecting more than   47 provinces and destroying 160,000 hectares of forest areas in Turkey,   we provided support to local communities and donated 20,000 saplings  to the Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion to be planted in the  impacted region. •  Flooding in Brazil and Europe: In Brazil, we partnered with the Brazilian Red  Cross to provide first aid, food and psychosocial support to those impacted  by heavy flooding, affecting dozens of cities across the country. In Europe,  we donated funds to the German Red Cross for disaster relief efforts and sent  Consumer Health hygiene products to the disaster areas. When disaster strikes our communities  around the world, we invite  &   employees to make personal  donations, which are matched on a two-for- one basis by  &  to triple the  impact in helping affected populations.  &  is actively engaged in responding to and preventing a broad range of pandemic and epidemic  threats; our experience in these areas has been built over more than a century. Our track record in advancing vaccines  and novel treatment regimens and facilitating access to address multiple diseases such as HIV, TB, COVID-19, Ebola,  dengue and others, as well as addressing the growing threat of AMR, has made a significant contribution to global  public health and UN SDG 3, which aspires to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. We maintain a wide range of collaborative partnerships to advance global health security and pandemic preparedness. One such collaboration, BLUE KNIGHT, is between JLABS and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development  Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with the goal of accelerating the  research and development of potential solutions for a range of diseases with pandemic potential. In 2021, the  collaboration expanded residency opportunities to all JLABS and affiliate locations in North America as well as  maintaining a virtual, global engagement model. By the end of 2021, the BLUE KNIGHT portfolio had grown to 19  companies globally, dedicated to anticipating potential health security threats, activating the global innovation  community, and amplifying scientific and technological advancements. &  was a strategic sponsor of the 2021 World Health  Summit to advance the collaboration, solidarity and commitment that  will be necessary to tackle the infectious disease threats of both today  and tomorrow. Four senior leaders representing our advances in Global  Public Health shared their experience and insights at the conference. include a key focus on combating pandemics and  epidemics, with three goals addressing pandemic  preparedness, vaccination monitoring capabilities  and access plans for endemic disease assets in our  pipeline. In addition, we have specific goals relating   to developing and enhancing access to HIV and   TB treatments. The  &  COVID-19 vaccine was granted  Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. FDA  and Conditional Marketing Authorization by the European  Commission, in addition to Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by  the WHO. The Company’s COVID-19 vaccine was granted full  approval by Health Canada. Shipped 180 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the African  Union, COVAX, and South Africa through advanced purchase  agreements and country donations. Progress: Completed first large use case of the Vaccination  Monitoring Platform (VMP) through the UMURINZI campaign,  fully vaccinating more than 200,000 individuals against Ebola   in Rwanda. Also deployed VMP via the WHO Solidarity trial for COVID-19  vaccines in three countries (Colombia, Mali and the Philippines).  &  has a legacy of responding during crises. We have actively  engaged in fighting global epidemics and outbreaks from TB to HIV and Ebola,  and we leveraged this knowledge and experience in our actions to help fight  COVID-19. We have been and continue to be intensively engaged in activities  to help halt the COVID-19 pandemic through developing an easy-to-deploy  vaccine, conducting trials, obtaining regulatory authorizations, building supply  chain capabilities and engaging with partners around the world to support health  systems and healthcare providers involved in combating COVID-19—all at an  unprecedented speed. Consistent with this legacy,  &  was  among the early responders to the global pandemic in January 2020, where  we invested substantially in both antigen design and vaccine drug product  development to enter into trials by mid-2020, and launch into large global   studies of our COVID-19 vaccine by the third quarter of 2020. A commitment to global equity has guided the Company’s response since the  beginning of the pandemic, starting with the decision to pursue a vaccine that  can provide protection with a single dose and be easily stored and distributed  with standard refrigeration globally, including in resource-limited, rural or remote  settings. &  supported the development of its vaccine with a  global and inclusive clinical research program that studied the vaccine in the   U.S., Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America as we sought to generate evidence  across multiple geographies and diverse, at-risk populations, including in  resource-limited settings. Completing our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials: In January 2021,  &   shared top-line efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE  clinical trial, demonstrating that a single dose of the Company’s COVID-19  vaccine met all primary and key secondary endpoints. The final analysis of this  study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in March 2022  and demonstrated that a single shot provided 75% efficacy in preventing severe/ critical COVID-19 at least 28 days following vaccination. We also conducted the Phase 3 “ENSEMBLE 2” study to evaluate the safety   and efficacy of a homologous (same vaccine) booster shot administered 56   days after primary vaccination. A final analysis of the double-blind phase of this  trial is currently undergoing blinded peer review and has been submitted to a  scientific journal. Additionally, the  &  COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized as a  booster by multiple regulators and healthcare bodies around the world, including  a recommendation by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization  (SAGE) for the WHO, an EUA from the FDA, as well as a Positive Opinion for  use of the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine as a booster from the Committee for  Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency  (EMA). Boosting with the vaccine is permitted in homologous (same vaccine)  and/or heterologous (“mix-and-match”) vaccination regimens. Acting swiftly on vaccine safety: The safety and well-being of the people  who use our products is always our number one priority. For the  &   COVID-19 vaccine, we were notified of reports of a very rare adverse  event (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS), which can occur  
In 2021, 180 million  doses of our  COVID-19 vaccine  were shipped to the  African Union, COVAX  and South Africa  through advanced  purchase agreements  and country  donations. following vaccination. In response, we acted swiftly and in full collaboration and  transparency with the FDA, CDC, EMA, WHO and others to investigate; take  appropriate action; and update our COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheets for healthcare  providers, vaccine recipients and caregivers. &  continues  to collaborate with health authorities around the world to ensure HCPs and  individuals are fully informed about TTS, enabling correct diagnosis, appropriate  treatment and expedited reporting. In May 2022,  & , in close  coordination with the FDA, updated its U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet to  increase awareness about the risk of thrombosis with TTS, a rare but potentially  life-threatening condition. Generating real-world evidence: In January 2022,  &   announced results, which were subsequently peer reviewed and published   in JAMA Network Open, from the largest study conducted in the U.S. to date   on the durability of COVID-19 vaccines. The study found that a single shot of   the  &  COVID-19 vaccine resulted in protection at least  six months against COVID-19 breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and  intensive care unit admissions. The study showed that the effectiveness of  the vaccine against breakthrough infections and hospitalizations remained  especially durable. In parallel, our research indicated that the vaccine induces   a very strong cellular immune response, distinguishing it from other vaccines  and likely contributing to its durability of protection and its breadth of  protection from emerging variants. In December 2021, we announced new preliminary results from the South  African Phase 3b Sisonke (TOGETHER) study, which showed that a single shot  of the  &  COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated 85% effectiveness  against COVID-19-related hospitalization. Through the Sisonke study, the  Government of South Africa was able to make 500,000 donated doses of the   &  COVID-19 vaccine immediately available to healthcare  workers for use in South Africa. The study was sponsored and conducted by  the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) and showed that the   &  booster reduced the risk of hospitalization from COVID-19  among healthcare workers in South Africa after Omicron became the dominant  variant. In November 2021, the next phase of the study, called “Sisonke 2”,  began offering booster shots of the  &  COVID-19 vaccine to  Sisonke clinical trial participants. Equitable access to our COVID-19 vaccine:  &  remains  committed to ensuring equitable global access to its COVID-19 vaccine   candidate for people around the world. In 2021,  &  provided  its vaccine globally at a not-for-profit price and through its advance purchase  agreements (APAs) and country donations, shipped approximately 70% of its  global vaccine supply to LMICs. As of March 2022,  &  has  shipped more than 220 million vaccine doses to Africa through a combination   of our APAs with the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT); South Africa  and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and on behalf of the COVAX Facility, along with  government donations. COVAX aims to support the world’s COVID-19 vaccination  needs, particularly in lower-income countries globally, while AVAT procures  COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of the African Union’s 55 member states. As part   of our efforts for global vaccine equity, we have supported the donation of   &  COVID-19 vaccine doses by the U.S. government and EU  member states to COVAX. Additionally, we support the COVAX Humanitarian  Buffer through an agreement with the U.S. government and Gavi that enables  access to our COVID-19 vaccine for the world’s most vulnerable people. Supplying our COVID-19 vaccine:  &  launched unprecedented  efforts to manufacture our COVID-19 vaccine. We forged partnerships across   four continents, including manufacturers in South Africa and India, to establish   the manufacturing capacity and capabilities that would enable us to deliver   our vaccine on a global scale. We also worked efficiently with numerous   suppliers to quickly source the more than 160 different materials required   for vaccine production. Our COVID-19 manufacturing collaborations each include a license to our  technology and the sharing of manufacturing know-how to enable the safe and  high-quality production of our vaccine. We worked with our partners, regulatory  authorities and governments to expedite all steps of the vaccine production  process and to activate our manufacturing sites as quickly as health authority  approvals allowed. As with all vaccines, the manufacturing and supply chain for  our COVID-19 vaccine is highly complex, and it takes time to scale up production. Although we have experienced challenges in fully activating our global supply  network, we have overcome these challenges and continue to focus our efforts   on ensuring our vaccine is available during the pandemic where people are most  in need. Catalyzing vaccine production in Africa for Africa: Early in the pandemic, we  sought a strategic partner in Africa to whom we could transfer our ‘fill-and-finish’  manufacturing technology. In 2021, our strategic partner, Aspen Pharmacare  in South Africa, successfully manufactured millions of doses of our vaccine for  delivery globally, including across Africa, which is critically important given the  comparatively low vaccination rates across the continent. Building on this, in  March 2022,  &  announced a landmark agreement between  Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Aspen SA Operations (Pty) Ltd, which enables the  first COVID-19 vaccine to be manufactured and sold by an African company for  people living in Africa, with the goal of increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates  across the continent. Data from the Sisonke study confirm that  the  &  COVID-19 booster  shot provides robust effectiveness against  hospitalization in areas where Omicron is  dominant. This adds to our growing body of  evidence, which shows that the effectiveness  of the  &  COVID-19 vaccine  remains strong and stable over time, including  against circulating variants such as Omicron  and Delta. The arrival of  & ’s  COVID-19 single-shot vaccine in Africa was  the focus of an important press conference,  where Dr. John Nkengasong, Director of the  the Africa Centres for Disease Control and  Prevention, heralded the arrival as a historic  day for Africa. Contributing to vaccine confidence: Vaccines can only be effective in a  pandemic if they are accepted as a positive health intervention by the majority  of people. In this context,  &  funded a large-scale multicountry  study, conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  (LSHTM), aiming to explore the public’s intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. The  study examined the sociodemographic and emotional determinants of COVID-19  vaccine uptake for more than 19,000 individuals in 17 countries and provided  important insights into worldwide variations in COVID-19 vaccine uptake intent. We believe that continued work in vaccine confidence is critical to understanding  public sentiment and informing the creation of the most effective channels and  communications for vaccine deployment. &  is also contributing to the collective vaccine confidence effort  in Africa by leveraging our market research expertise to produce insight-based  tools in support of public vaccine education campaigns 
Supporting WHO COVID-19 vaccine research: In 2021, the WHO launched a  new platform of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of promising  new COVID-19 vaccines. The Solidarity Trial Vaccines (STV) started recruitment  in Colombia, Mali and the Philippines and are expected to expand to more  countries. Critical to the success of STV is the Vaccination Monitoring Platform  (VMP), a digital tool that helps improve participant identification and tracing,  data management and two-way communication with participants to implement  impactful clinical trials. Our contribution in helping make STV a success was  recognized by the WHO in a public statement at the launch of the study. Mosaico continues global Phase 3 HIV vaccine trial: Our large-scale   efficacy study, Mosaico, continued to run in 2021. Mosaico aims to test the safety  and efficacy of a specific composition of an investigational HIV vaccine regimen  among men who have sex with men and transgender individuals and is being  conducted in the Americas and Europe. The regimen is based on ADVAC viral  vector technology, which Janssen successfully used in the development of our  COVID-19 and Ebola vaccines. Our other large-scale Phase 2b HIV  vaccine clinical trial, Imbokodo,36 was  discontinued in 2021 after data showed  the investigational HIV vaccine regimen  did not provide sufficient protection  against HIV in a population of young  women in sub-Saharan Africa at  elevated risk of acquiring HIV. Though  the trial did not continue, following  completion of all vaccinations in 2020,  further analysis of the Imbokodo study  is ongoing, and the study has provided  enough data to progress with key  immunological research to help inform  future research in this field. It has now been more than 40 years since the first cases of what would become  known as AIDS, caused by HIV, were reported in 1981. While a cure continues  to evade our best science, groundbreaking innovation in advanced treatments  have helped transform HIV from a terminal illness into a manageable condition,  enabling those affected by the virus to enjoy productive lives. After a long history of developing progressive treatments for HIV, we achieved  another highly significant milestone in HIV drug development: FDA approval of  the world’s first long-acting injectable (LAI) HIV treatment regimen,35 approved  for both an every-month dosing schedule (12 injections per year) in January 2021  and an every-two-months dosing schedule (six injections per year) in February  2022. The LAI regimen includes two antiretroviral drugs, one developed by  Janssen (rilpivirine) and the other by ViiV Healthcare (cabotegravir). The LAI regimen replaces a daily two- or three-drug oral regimen with two  injections administered on the same day either every one or two months,  significantly easing the burden of medication and facilitating adherence. Further,  daily pill regimens may create stigma for those living with HIV, creating a barrier  to seeking and adhering to treatment due to fear of disclosure. LAI regimens  could provide solutions to these challenges and, supported by ongoing efforts  to expand access to HIV treatment, help transform the lives of those living with  HIV while bringing us closer to our commitment of making HIV history. In 2021,   &  and ViiV Healthcare submitted regulatory filings for the  everyother-month dosing schedule of the cabotegravir + rilpivirine LAI regimen  in Botswana and South Africa. This marks the first such filings in resource- limited settings, illustrating our commitment to help ensure innovative products  reach patients in need in LMICs as quickly as possible. people with HIV accessing  antiretroviral therapy (ART)  globally as of June 2020  (9.5 million people without  access to ART). people (approx.) died from  AIDS-related illnesses  worldwide in 2020, compared  to 1.3 million in 2010, a  testimony to the effectiveness  of and access to treatment. Imbokodo enrolled  approximately 2,600  young women across  23 trial sites in five  countries in sub- Saharan Africa for  four vaccination   visits over one year. The high incidence of HIV among young women in sub- Saharan Africa reminds us that, despite great progress made  in treatment and prevention, HIV remains a major health  challenge for the region. This underscores the need to apply  the knowledge that will be gained from this trial to continue  to advance the pursuit of a global HIV vaccine. Professor Glenda Gray  President and Chief Executive Officer, South African Medical Research Council  (SAMRC) and Imbokodo’s Protocol Chair HIV treatment in the last mile: Many people worldwide still live beyond the reach  of traditional healthcare systems and without access to care. Closing this “last  mile” of health delivery and ensuring global, equitable access to modern HIV  treatments is one of the most significant challenges in global health. We funded  a multiyear pilot study program with the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala,  Uganda, to test the feasibility of delivering lifesaving HIV treatments quickly,  efficiently and reliably to people in need in the Kalangala District using customized  medical drones. The Kalangala District comprises 84 islands on Lake Victoria,  accessible for drug supply and to health workers only by boat, often in adverse  weather conditions, which cause delays to deliveries and safety risks for   health workers. The first regularly scheduled medical drone flight took place in April 2021. The  program serves five landing sites across the region, reaching approximately 100  people living with HIV and has the potential of reaching more than 1,000, if it  scales. The program also offers an opportunity for researchers to quantify the  effectiveness of medical drones’ HIV drug delivery through a Randomized Control  Trial that will help inform future efforts to scale drone technology to solve other  last mile delivery challenges in Uganda and elsewhere. Pediatric HIV treatment and prevention: Getting HIV treatments to those who  need them remains a challenge in many parts of the world, especially in sub- Saharan Africa. A combination tablet, containing our product PREZISTA (darunavir)  in a fixed-dose combination with ritonavir 50mg, received WHO Prequalification,  enabling its use in helping address the high unmet need in second- and third-line  treatments for adults and children in an accessible and affordable form. Further,  data from the Nucleosides and Darunavir/Dolutegravir in Africa study38 was  published in The New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrating the efficacy  of ritonavir-boosted darunavir as a second-line treatment. Following these  successes, along with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF),  we announced our renewed commitment and the next phase of the New Horizons  Collaborative, which includes an extension of our darunavir donation program and  a commitment to continue enrolling new pediatric HIV patients through at least  2025. This is also an important step toward meeting our commitments to help  tackle the challenge of pediatric HIV as part of the Rome 5 Paediatric HIV and  TB Action Plan. A woman explains the use of a dapivirine ring in preventing HIV to a group of adolescents  in Africa. Photo by International Partnership for Microbicides. HIV prevention for women and girls: The dapivirine ring, recommended in 2021  by the WHO as an additional prevention choice for women with a substantial  chance of contracting HIV as part of combination prevention approaches,   was a popular choice among African adolescent girls in a recent study. The dapivirine ring is a long-acting HIV prevention method specifically for  women, developed by the International Partnership for Microbicides and based  on Janssen’s ARV compound. The flexible, silicone ring is discreet, easy to use,  has minimal side effects and only needs to be replaced monthly. In July 2021, Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) presented interim data   showing a strong preference for the dapivirine ring and higher adherence than  previously observed. Further, a U.S. National Institutes of Health funded Phase 3b study, DELIVER  (MTN-042), showed encouraging interim safety results for the use of   the dapivirine ring late in pregnancy. The study is ongoing among pregnant  women who are HIV negative in four sub-Saharan African countries with a high  prevalence of HIV/AIDS, especially in women. MTN is also conducting a study on  the ring’s safety and use among women who are breastfeeding (MTN-043). of study participants said  they liked the monthly  dapivirine ring during the  six months they were   asked to use it. Several studies have  shown that pregnancy is  associated with an increase  in susceptibility to HIV  acquisition.37 
We need to have a range of HIV prevention  options so that women can choose the one  that works best for them. The dapivirine vaginal  ring is something they can control—putting the  power to reduce their HIV risk in their hands. MenStar has contributed to initiating more than  2.2 million men aged 15+ years onto treatment  and has achieved 94% viral suppression among  those men since 2018. Education for HIV prevention: In sub-Saharan Africa, DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDSfree, Mentored  and Safe) Thina Abantu Abasha (DTAA), a youth-led, peer-to-peer HIV prevention program, continues to empower  adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) with leadership, employability, sexual and reproductive health and rights  information, and skills in two South African provinces. In 2021, the DTAA program reached more than 1.3 million AGYW  through a reading competition, targeted radio programming and extensive use of social media. The MenStar Coalition helps break the cycle  of HIV transmission among men by providing  the services and support they need. HIV diagnosis and treatment for men: As a founding member of the MenStar Coalition, we continue to support  strategy and programs aiming to expand the diagnosis and treatment of HIV infections in men, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa. &  is a co-founder  of the New Horizons Collaborative,  which aims to improve treatment  and care for children with HIV in 11  countries across the region through  drug donation and capacity building. & ’s New Horizons Collaborative  has saved thousands of lives and addressed some  of the most daunting obstacles posed by the HIV  pandemic. We are just thrilled to celebrate 30 years  of collaboration with  &  this year. Tuberculosis (TB) is preventable and curable, yet it remains one of the top causes  of death worldwide, claiming more than a million lives each year. Addressing  this public health challenge is complex due to increasing resistance to the most  frequently used first-line TB medicines (see section: Antimicrobial Resistance)  and, in the last two years, disruption in health services and diversion of healthcare  resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. &  has been a committed partner in the fight against TB—from  the lab to the last mile of healthcare—for more than two decades. Our efforts are  part of a comprehensive 10-year TB initiative, launched by  &   in 2018 and focused on treatment access, patient finding and R&D. In addition,  in 2019, we committed $500 million over four years to spur the development and  delivery of TB and HIV innovations, and in 2020, we announced our commitment  to Pediatric TB as part of the Rome Action Plan. The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed years of progress   in providing essential TB services and has disrupted  already-fragile systems for TB treatment and care around  the world. •  Advancing the Ending Workplace TB initiative, a multisectoral collaboration  that we colaunched in 2020, which leverages the untapped potential  of businesses in countries disproportionately impacted by TB to roll out  awareness, detection and treatment programs in their workplaces to reach  millions of workers, their families and communities. Business-led efforts  to fight TB are an important complement to national TB programs. Several   &  suppliers joined the initiative in 2021. •  Executing a historic Memorandum of Understanding with the National TB  Elimination Program (NTBEP) in India for the TB Changemakers program   in which  &  and the NTBEP are committed to engaging  youth to raise awareness and improve healthy behaviors in themselves and  those around them. This program is targeted to reach at least 20 million  youth in eight Indian cities in an innovative digital initiative as part of India’s  National Program. •  In South Africa, we are working with Aquity Innovations to improve  diagnosis and treatment for children and adolescents living with DR-TB. This initiative includes capacity-building efforts to support training and  mentorship programs, social mapping to improve contact tracing and  elevating local TB champions and advocates. Notably, with  &  ’s support, Aquity Innovations has helped reopen a pediatric TB  ward that was initially closed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on these efforts, in 2022, we announced a series of youth initiatives  aimed at helping to empower a generation of youth to end TB and supporting  efforts to find the “missing millions” of undiagnosed TB cases. &  , together with the Central TB Division under the Ministry of Health  of India, the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, Aquity Innovations and others,  will support and engage young people to drive health-seeking behavior, build  community awareness and reduce stigma to enhance early diagnosis of TB. Collaborating to accelerate research: In early 2021, we launched the J&J  Centers for Global Health Discovery, a new, global network of unique research  collaborations that will leverage the strengths of  &  and leading  academic institutions to accelerate discovery research to address the world’s  most pressing global health challenges. The first J&J Satellite Center for Global  Health Discovery was launched at the LSHTM, and additional J&J Centers will  launch worldwide in 2022 and 2023. The J&J Centers will advance the critical, early-stage discovery and exploratory  science needed to develop potentially lifesaving innovations to address diseases  
Essential medicine for pediatric MDR-TB: In 2021, the WHO added the 20mg  pediatric formulation of SIRTURO (bedaquiline) as part of combination therapy  to the EML and the Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc).40   This new milestone builds on FDA and EMA approvals of bedaquiline 20mg  tablet, as part of combination therapy for the treatment of MDR-TB in children  aged 5 years and older and weighing at least 15kg. Research to inform the  dosing of bedaquiline in MDR-TB children below the age of 5 is ongoing. The WHO EML and the EMLc include the medications considered to be  efficacious, safe and cost-effective and help guide and prioritize the selection  of medicines for national needs in more than 150 countries. &   remains committed to ensuring this essential medicine is available, accessible  and affordable. Working to help end TB: In recognition of World TB Day in 2021, we announced  a series of new commitments in support of global efforts to find and deliver  care to the millions of adults and children living with TB who have not yet been  diagnosed. Identifying undiagnosed people living with TB, especially those  living with DR-TB, remains one of the most significant obstacles in achieving  SDG target 3.3 that aims to put an end to epidemics, including TB, by 2030. Four out of 10 people with TB go undiagnosed and untreated, a situation  exacerbated by health disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.41  Collaborating with national governments, nonprofit organizations and the  private sector is an important part of making care accessible to thousands of  people and protecting the vulnerable communities in which many of them live. Among others, these initiatives included: 
•  Project inSight, a collaboration with the Global Fund in Indonesia and the  Philippines that is furthering understanding of the difficulties of identifying  DR-TB patients. We expect to devise new strategies to amplify efforts to  identify, engage and support people living with DR-TB, particularly in the  context of the COVID-19 pandemic. that disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable people. Each Satellite  Center will focus on entrenched and emerging threats that have a high unmet  need, including TB, flavivirus and AMR. Additionally in 2021, together with a global consortium of 30 partners from 13  countries, we launched UNITE4TB to develop new TB and DR-TB treatments. This  multiyear, collaborative initiative aims to accelerate improved clinical evaluation   of combinations of existing and novel drugs, with the goal of developing highly  active TB treatment regimens for drug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB. UNITE4TB  is a project of the IMI AMR Accelerator, a public-private collaboration that aims   to progress the development of new medicines to treat or prevent resistant  bacterial infections. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has  powerfully demonstrated the importance of  investing in basic science and discovery. We  have long worked with  &  to  tackle significant global health challenges, like  tuberculosis and Ebola, and are eager to build  on this work in pursuit of a healthier, safer and  more equitable world. Our history of combating the Ebola virus goes back more than 20 years. The  Zaire ebolavirus has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of individuals, mainly  in Africa, since it first appeared in 1976, and the cadence of new outbreaks is  increasing. In our efforts to develop a vaccine to halt the spread of this deadly  virus, we have focused on Zaire ebolavirus and conducted more than 15 clinical  trials sponsored by  &  and multiple collaborations since 2002. Today,  & ’s two-dose Ebola vaccine regimen comprising  ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Bavarian Nordic’s MVABEA (MVA-BN-Filo) is  indicated for active immunization of disease caused by the Ebola virus (Zaire  ebolavirus species) in individuals ≥1 year of age. Additionally, in March 2022, the Ghana Food and Drugs Authority granted  conditional Marketing Authorization to the  &  Ebola vaccine  regimen, becoming the first African regulatory authority to approve the regimen  for commercial use. Proven safety and immunogenicity of our Ebola vaccine regimen: Confirming  previous clinical trial findings, results from our EBOVAC-Salone Phase 3 study  conducted in Sierra Leone found that our Ebola vaccine regimen is safe and  generates strong immunity in both children and adults. Data from two papers  
Similarly, newly published data in PLOS Medicine demonstrated that    & ’s Ebola vaccine regimen was well tolerated and induced   a robust immune response in both healthy adults and adults living with HIV. As of December 2021, more than 262,000  people worldwide have received a first   dose of  & ’s Ebola vaccine  regimen, including 233,000 who have been   fully vaccinated. In 2021,  &  welcomed the  recommendation by the Strategic Advisory  Group of Experts on Immunization for the  WHO in support of the use of  &  ’s Ebola vaccine regimen during  outbreaks for individuals at risk of Ebola  exposure and preventively, before outbreaks,  for national and international first responders. published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases demonstrated that the regimen  generated robust antibody immune responses in adults and children   (ages 1 – 17) with the immune responses persisting in adults for at least two   years. The data also showed that booster vaccination, administered to adults   two years after the initial vaccination, induced a strong immune response   within seven days. Following Marketing Authorization granted  by the European Commission in July  2020, the regimen was granted WHO  Prequalification in April 2021—the first   &  vaccine to receive WHO  Prequalification—and will help advance  preparedness strategies for countries with  the potential for Ebola outbreaks. Milestone vaccinations in Rwanda: In 2021, we achieved a significant milestone  in our support to the Government of Rwanda’s UMURINZI campaign: completion  of the full vaccination of more than 200,000 Rwandans against Ebola with the   &  Ebola vaccine regimen. This vaccination program also  represented the first large use case of the VMP, a suite of digital technologies  that integrates biometric identification, mobile phone messaging and data  management into a single tool that empowers healthcare workers and vaccination  teams to drive successful, multidose vaccination campaigns. Ongoing, the INGABO study, which was established as part of UMURINZI to  evaluate the vaccine in healthy pregnant women, continues. As of March 2022,   the study is 95% enrolled and is critical to advancing our vision of preventing   Ebola outbreaks. This is a vaccine that can be used more broadly,  including to protect children from being infected by  Ebola, so this is a very important finding that can be  worked into the process of preparing supplies. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect more than 1 billion people   worldwide, predominantly among the poorest and most vulnerable populations  in tropical climates. Of the 20 NTDs prioritized in the WHO roadmap 2021 –  2030,42  &  research and medicines support the treatment  and prevention of three high-prevalence NTDs: dengue; soil-transmitted  helminthiasis (STH), also known as intestinal worms; and leprosy. As a  longstanding partner in the fight against NTDs for nearly two decades,   &  collaborates across sectors to develop sophisticated diagnostics and  data management systems, build capacity, and support frontline health workers  while pursuing an R&D pipeline to advance solutions for the prevention and  treatment of NTDs. The  Hall Clock Tower at our World  Headquarters in New Brunswick was lit up   in orange and violet on January 30, 2022,  joining more than 40 cities and more than   100 landmarks to “light up the world” in   honor of the third annual World NTD Day. 3.9 billion people are at risk in 128 countries, of which more than  100 are endemic for dengue. 0.08% of those infected lose their  lives to dengue. About 30 million people are estimated at risk, with more than  200,000 reports of infections from 119 countries in 2019, including  more than 14,000 children. 92 countries required mass drug administration in 2019, mostly  across sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia but also in  some areas of the European region. Reaching a milestone in treating STH: By the close of 2021, we surpassed a  total of two billion doses cumulatively donated of VERMOX (mebendazole),  our medicine to treat intestinal worm infections. Since the donation program’s  inception in 2006, VERMOX has been administered to people in need in more  than 50 resource-limited countries worldwide. Our longstanding donation  program aims to help children, who are especially vulnerable to intestinal  worms, live healthier lives. Our extended VERMOX donation commitment   aims to ensure that up to one billion doses of VERMOX Chewable (mebendazole  chewable 500mg tablets) are provided in the 2021 – 2025 period to high- burden countries, treating up to 100 million children each year. In 2021, the   first year of this commitment,  &  donated more than 220  million doses of VERMOX in chewable and tablet formulations. &  has supported BRAC, an international nonprofit leading  the fight against STH in Bangladesh, where one in two children is infected. Through the program, BRAC has trained nearly 200 community health workers  and more than 4,000 school mentors to educate families on deworming. In  turn, these providers have educated more than 100,000 mothers and caregivers  through health forums and reached more than 90,000 children with deworming  medication through schools and community deworming camps. More than 15 years ago,  &  committed  to address the threat of intestinal worms. The reach and  the impact of this program is a testament to the power of  enduring commitment and unprecedented collaboration  across sectors and shows that together, we can tackle the  most significant challenges in global health. Targeted research and collaboration addressing other NTDs: We continue to  investigate improving the efficacy and safety of treatment for leprosy through  a proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial that is currently running to assess the safety,  pharmacokinetics and efficacy of eight weeks of bedaquiline monotherapy in  participants with multibacillary leprosy. The trial is fully enrolled with a primary  completion date in January 2023. We are also collaborating with the Walter and  Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in an extended drug-discovery  collaboration to develop potential new antimalarial drug candidates. Advancing protection against the dengue virus: We shared new preclinical  data,44 published in Nature, showing that an early stage compound with a novel  mechanism of action could potentially treat all serotypes of dengue and provide  protection against acquiring dengue, an achievement no antiviral has delivered  to date. Building on this research, we completed a Phase 1, first-in-human clinical  study evaluating a small molecule with a novel mechanism of antiviral action,  which confirmed the dengue-specific antiviral to be safe and well-tolerated in  humans. This marks an important step forward in assessing our novel dengue  antiviral, as there are currently no treatments available for dengue, and the sole  licensed vaccine is approved for limited use. Our breakthrough work in dengue signals what is  possible when collaborative science is applied at  the discovery phase and channeled toward great  unmet need in public health.

NTD surveillance and research: Together with public and private organizations  and governments,  &  is helping streamline the diagnosis and  surveillance of NTDs in low-resource countries by developing novel technology  using AI. Through our unique collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,  Germany’s Global Health Institute and other organizations, we strive to optimize  the impact of the interventions by providing tools to improve efficiency and  accuracy of diagnosis, including an AI-based tool that aims to enable country  programs to effectively monitor and target treatment for STH. Additionally,  in partnership with WIPO Re:Search, we make our JumpstARter Compound  Library of 80,000 small molecules and compounds fragments freely available  to drug discovery researchers to help identify and advance promising drug  candidates to fight NTDs. Actively seeking new antibiotics: As a founding member of the AMR Action  Fund, our $100 million commitment advances the Fund’s goal of bringing two  to four new antibiotics wto patients by 2030. As the world’s largest public- private partnership, the AMR Action Fund aims to invest more than $1 billion in  smaller biotech companies and provide industry expertise to support the clinical  development of novel antibiotics. In 2021, the AMR Action Fund announced its  first non-industry investments, raising an additional $140 million, adding to the  initial investment from more than 20 leading biopharmaceutical companies that  established the Fund in July 2020. Leading the way to outpace AMR: For the third year in a row,  &   is proud to be named one of the top three companies leading the  way in addressing the complex health challenge of AMR. The 2021 AMR  Benchmark, developed by the independent Access to Medicine Foundation,  recognized our strong performance across three critical areas: 
Our  &  Global Public   Health and Janssen Infectious Diseases and  Vaccines teams are critical to maintaining   our position at the forefront of impact against  AMR—from tackling DR-TB to advancing   the development of a vaccine against ExPEC   and exploring innovative CRISPR-Cas3- enhanced bacteriophage technology to   develop targeted treatments. The WHO considers antimicrobial resistance (AMR) one of the top 10 global health  threats,45 with the potential to cause 10 million deaths each year by 2050.46 The  reducing effectiveness of today’s antibiotics can turn everyday infections and  simple surgical procedures into potentially life-or-death ordeals. For example,  most surgical procedures from appendectomies to joint replacements or even   coronary bypasses rely on antibiotics to prevent life-threatening infections. Growing drug resistance is compounding AMR as a public health challenge. For example, drug-resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB) now accounts for nearly  one-third of all deaths from AMR, with hundreds of thousands of new cases of  DR-TB detected each year (see section: Tuberculosis). Further, the increase in  hospitalizations and antibiotic use in COVID-19 treatment is predicted to further  exacerbate AMR. Greater innovation is urgently needed to  outpace AMR by safeguarding the treatments  we have today and accelerating the  development of the treatments of tomorrow. Leading practices in overcoming AMR: The AMR Industry Alliance (AMRIA)  brings together biotech, diagnostics, generics and research-based pharmaceutical  companies to drive and measure industry progress to curb AMR. The recently  published 2021 AMRIA Progress Report cites  & ’s notable  contributions in recognition of our efforts to innovate and advocate to outpace   the threat of AMR, including:  
•  Expanding the availability of bedaquiline, including the pediatric formulation  and several partnerships to support access to treatment in the regions that  need it most;  
•  Maintaining a resilient supply chain to ensure alignment between demand,  inventory, supply and manufacturing to meet the needs in resource-limited  settings, even during events causing major disruption; Our employees at  & —144,300 individuals around the world—continue to be energized by our shared purpose to blend heart,  science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. We promote a culture of respect, inclusion and excellence,  inspired by Our Credo, so that the talent of every individual at  &  can be leveraged to ensure our Company, our communities  and our environment, and each of us as individuals can thrive and grow. These ambitions will help focus our efforts to make our workplace   even more diverse and inclusive, improve the health and wellness of our   employees, and expand our engagement to encourage more girls toward  STEM education, helping to create a more equitable workforce for   tomorrow and strengthen communities. We believe that one of our greatest differentiators at  &  is that we are firmly committed  to living Our Credo. The strength we draw from these universal values has guided us decade after decade  to respect our employees; foster a culture of well-being; embed diversity, equity and inclusion everywhere  we work around the globe; and provide opportunities for everyone to share in meaningful work that  contributes to better health for humanity. We must provide an inclusive work environment   where each person must be considered as an   individual. We must respect their diversity and   dignity and recognize their merit. With this in mind, our mission is to make DEI how we work every  day. We advance our culture of belonging where open hearts   and minds combine to unleash the potential of the brilliant mix   of people, in every corner of  & . Diversity is about each individual’s unique perspective. It’s about each of us, our colleagues and the world we  care for—all backgrounds, beliefs and the entire   range of human experience. Equity is tailoring tools and resources to meet the unique  needs of each individual and continuously improving  our systems and processes, so everyone has the  opportunity to reach their full potential. Inclusion is creating a deep sense of belonging, where  each individual is valued, each one’s ideas are heard and  everyone advances this culture for everyone. Progress: 6% of management positions in the U.S.  are held by Black and African American employees,  representing growth of 25% from 2020. Our strategic approach to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion is a moral and business imperative and an essential   part of our success. We strive to seamlessly infuse DEI into all business areas and across every region to drive impact  through inclusive research, development, partnerships, charitable giving and suppliers. At the heart of this are our  employees, because we know that bringing our diverse backgrounds, cultures, experiences and perspectives together   is the best way to solve today’s complex health problems and to create a healthier, more equitable world. In 2021, we refreshed our DEI strategy to reflect our experiences, our learning, and the future state of the world in which we live and  work. Specifically, we added a fourth strategic pillar with a focus on equity, making a commitment to transform our talent and business  processes to achieve equitable outcomes for all. Our third annual DEI Impact Review shares insights about the evolution of our DEI strategy and a wide range of stories of our progress  throughout 2021 to advance DEI across the four pillars of our new strategy within our three business segments.

new leaders participated in our  Enterprise Leader Development  Program in 2021, bringing the  total number of leaders trained  to date to 13,131 
sampling of countries in 2021. Additionally, we completed our annual living wage  assessment with the aim of ensuring all employees globally receive pay that is  competitive in their local markets and sufficient to support a sustainable standard  of living for them and their families (see section: Human Rights). In addition to  salary and wages, our benefits packages aim to improve the quality of life for  employees by providing support for family, health and well-being; education; and  long-term financial management needs. We continuously review and update the  range of benefits we offer in line with new needs as they arise, employee feedback  and changes in market practices. New hybrid working model: In 2021, in recognition of the new way of working,  we initiated J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers our eligible office-based  employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote  work. This model allows for work to happen seamlessly across a variety of  workplaces and is enabled by an array of enhanced collaboration tools and  technology to optimize productivity and connection. J&J Flex rolled out in late  2021 globally and will continue deployment through 2022 as protocols and  requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic allow. We continue to evaluate  flexible work strategies for our on-site workforce, such as virtual onboarding and  
training, to help our employees balance their personal and professional lives. Also,  we continued to enhance our benefits offerings with access to wellness tools,  on-site vaccine clinics, mental health support resources and delivery of at-home  testing kits. During 2021, we also introduced a number of new benefits to support the   well-being of our employees and their families (see section: Employee Health,  Safety & Wellness). Across  & , employees find inspiration in Our Purpose to change  the trajectory of health and leverage the platforms, tools and resources that  we provide across the Enterprise to help everyone contribute effectively. We  encourage open and inclusive communications so that everyone feels welcome to  offer ideas and suggestions about how we can improve outcomes for patients and  consumers as well as in the way we care for our communities and our planet. Listening to our employees: In 2021, we conducted our biennial Our Voice Survey,  which was administered in 77 countries and made available in 36 languages. In a  year of continued unprecedented challenges, the Company achieved a significant  participation rate and improved favorability, which reflects how we are fulfilling  our commitments to our employees. We benchmark our performance on the Our Voice Survey with the Mayflower  Group, which is a consortium of top-tier, global companies dedicated to employee  surveys. Our scores fall well above the median score of the Mayflower Group  companies with regard to employees recommending the Company as a great  place to work and wanting to stay with the Company—both critical components  of employee engagement. Following analysis of the detailed results, which were  communicated to all employees, we developed plans to address the main areas  of opportunity identified by our employees’ voice, both at the corporate level and  within individual teams. In alternate years, we conduct Our Credo Survey, which tracks employee  sentiment and feeling of being connected to our colleagues and our values. Women in STEM: Through our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, we encourage  our employees to play an active role in engaging with our nonprofit partners  to expose more girls to science, technology, engineering, mathematics,  manufacturing and design (STEM²D) activities in the knowledge that advancing  gender equality in technical professions will both strengthen society and also  build a stronger pipeline of diverse talent in these under-resourced professions,  critical to advancing innovation in healthcare. Our Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Manufacturing  and Design (WiSTEM²D) initiative supports youth, undergraduates, scholars  and professionals and has been active since 2015. Through our WiSTEM²D  Youth Pillar, where we seek to spark enchantment with STEM²D in young  women and girls all around the globe through creative problem-solving and  play, in 2021 more than 2,400  &  employee volunteers  directly engaged with approximately 300,000 girls. The program also indirectly  engaged with more than 6 million girls through nonprofit partnerships and  teachers across more than 30 countries. 91%   agreed: I would like to be   working at  &   one year from now. 87%   agreed: I would recommend    &  as a   great place to work. Additionally, our WiSTEM²D University Pillar organizes events and activities with  partner universities as well as internships, professional development programs and  various other opportunities for students. In 2021, WiSTEM²D partnered with more  than 65 universities and delivered more than 90 events, reaching more than 7,000  undergraduate university students. Each year since 2017, we have selected female STEM²D tenure-track professors  who are making key STEM²D discoveries as part of our ongoing WiSTEM2D  Scholars Award Program. Each awardee receives a grant of $150,000 and three  years of mentorship. Despite research work being severely impacted by the  COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, we received more than 430 applications from highly  qualified nominees from around the world. With a focus on global diversity, more  than 68% of applicants were from outside the U.S. We again selected six women  scholars, whose work represents pivotal global innovations across diverse fields of  interest for better healthcare outcomes.

WeSustain, our environmental sustainability employee engagement program,  mobilizes passionate employees to improve the environmental health of the places  where we live, work and sell our products. In 2021, the number of WeSustain  teams active across 32 countries increased from 67 to 78. WeSustain teams  are focused on taking action to protect the environment and human health by  educating and inspiring other employees to adopt sustainable behaviors through  their roles at work and at home. A few examples of how local teams brought  unique sustainability engagements to life this year include: 
•  WeSustain Brazil organized an employee sustainability forum that attracted  employees from all across the Latin America region to hear from internal and  external thought leaders. •  WeSustain Japan focused on fostering a culture of sustainability through  awareness and educational opportunities. In 2021, the team hosted several  webinars and community activities, engaging thousands of employees  throughout the year. •  WeSustain Guelph, Canada, partnered with a local community group to turn  green space around our manufacturing site into a pollinator-friendly ecosystem. In early 2022, the site received certification from the Wildlife Habitat Council. •  We launched an optional self-paced online learning and development program  on environmental sustainability and our environmental goals. Thousands of  employees completed the program within six months of launch. •  We continued to activate our virtual platform, Healthy Planet, launched  in 2020, to connect employees from across the world to share ideas and  take environmentally sustainable actions through gamification. Customized  campaigns, events and idea boards allow us to cover topics that range from  water conservation, plastics and packaging, energy, climate and health, nature,  and recycling cooperatives to circular economy. Employees completed more  than 24,500 actions via Healthy Planet in 2021. Impact metrics from Healthy  Planet illustrated employee-led savings, including reduced paper use, reduced  trash, lower energy consumption and lower water use. Getting out of our comfort zones is very important  for our personal and professional growth. To balance  Global Pro Bono with my other projects, I awoke early  each morning to dedicate time to my pro bono partner,  Reach52, supporting the user experience of a portal  for community health workers and community access  managers. This adjustment to my usual morning routine  changed my life in amazing ways, filling me with  energy for my workday. By working in  & , we acquire   high-quality knowledge and experience, which allow  us to provide added value—not only to the business,  but also to these social organizations. It made me   very happy to serve as team lead for Fundación  Sangre Panama’s project to define a communications  and promotional plan for an app that improves this  partner’s community impact. In 2021, we maintained our Talent for Good programs across the Enterprise, with  most remaining virtual for the health and safety of our employees and partners.

The 2021 program included 25 community partners and 133  employees from 27 countries. •  Global Pro Bono: engages employees in pairs with selected partner  organizations working on the front lines of health to support them and   build organizational capacity over a period of 12 weeks for 20% of their time. The 2021 program included 11 partners and 47 employees from all of our four  geographic regions. •  Pro Bono for Health Equity: the newest Talent for Good program, launched in  2021, utilizes the skills and talents of  &  employees to build  
the capacity of U.S.-based Community Health Centers supporting  communities of color. This program is part of Our Race to Health Equity  commitment. •  Global Secondment Program: enables and empowers selected   &  employees to support partner organizations on  the front lines of health to raise public health standards in communities  around the globe by sharing their knowledge, skills and passions over a  four- to six-month time frame. •  Mitigation of workplace risks and ensuring employee health protection through  the implementation of corrective and preventative actions. * See the Employee Safety table in the ESG Performance Data section of this Report for footnote  considerations related to Global Employee Safety data. Ongoing safety during the pandemic: Protecting and supporting our employees  during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a top priority and our approach  includes: keeping employees informed of local COVID-19 transmission rates and  corresponding risk levels; promoting the health and safety of our employees in  the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access  to cleaning supplies and PPE; supporting employees with pay continuity, benefits  and well-being tools; providing a Global Recharge Day for additional time off  to rest, recover and build resilience; and recognizing extraordinary employee  contributions at work and in our communities. In addition, as COVID-19 vaccines  were broadly distributed and administered in 2021, we adopted policies in the  U.S., Puerto Rico and certain other countries to require proof of vaccination from   &  employees and contingent workers, where permitted by local  law and regulation. Supporting our superheroes: We continued to offer one additional working  week of paid time off for tens of thousands of essential on-site employees and a  paid-leave program for our medical staff who want to volunteer on the front lines  against COVID-19. At  & , our investment in employee health, well-being and safety  is built on our conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing  and protecting the total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—of  our workforce. We aim to ensure that all our employees around the world, as well  as temporary contractors and visitors to our sites, can work safely by providing  robust safety programs, risk assessments, training and communications. We  continuously expand health and well-being programs and benefits throughout   &  globally, incorporating new thinking and technologies to   help employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals. As we look toward 2025, we aspire to have the healthiest workforce,  further embedding our culture of health throughout  &  and  strengthening organizational capabilities in support of health and well-being. Through the continued expansion of our total health benefits, programs and  offerings, we’ll support the physical, mental and emotional well-being of our  workforce to continue to meet their needs, regardless of where they are in their  health journey. Our Health for Humanity Annual Healthiest Workforce Score will  help us track our success in fostering the world’s healthiest workforce. In 2021, we identified our Healthiest Workforce Score metrics  and set our baselines for measurement. The core metrics that  influence the Healthiest Workforce Score include:  
•  In 2021, we announced the extension of our paid parental leave benefit from  eight weeks to 12 weeks for all eligible employees globally to be implemented  on a phased basis in 2022 to all our regions.48  
•  Bereavement leave was extended from three to five days for employees in the  U.S. and Puerto Rico. •  We launched a Military Spouse Time-Off Policy for employees in the U.S. and  Puerto Rico, which provides up to 10 days of paid time off for eligible military  spouse employees when their families experience challenging situations arising  from military service. •  We updated our Military Leave Policy to enable National Guard and Reserve  service member employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico to receive full pay and  benefits during military leave for a maximum duration of three continuous  years—an increase from the previous two-year maximum. •  We expanded our Global Exercise Reimbursement, a popular benefit with   tens of thousands of employees, to include additional virtual subscriptions and  at-home equipment. We continue to evolve the reimbursement beyond exercise  to support total well-being. •  We piloted a new Employee Mental Well-Being Training to educate and  empower employees to prioritize their mental well-being and support their  colleagues to do the same. Digital health and well-being support: Digital health and well-being tools  continued to support employees to stay physically energized, emotionally  connected and mentally focused. This included the expansion of the online  confidential health risk assessment that helps employees understand how lifestyle  choices, health status and behavior influence their current and future well-being  and learn how to address modifiable health risks. Global Activity Challenge: Our sixth annual 30-day Global Activity Challenge  engaged more than 29,000 participants in 74 countries, encouraging employees  to be physically energized, reduce stress and boost their total health. Energy management: Our enterprise-wide ENERGY FOR PERFORMANCE  program helps employees manage their energy capacity so that they can be  their best at work and in life. We have consistently expanded the use of this  program and introduced virtual courses to continue to deliver this important  training during the pandemic. In 2021, 9,816 employees completed ENERGY FOR  PERFORMANCE courses. At  & , we understand that human health and environmental health are fundamentally linked—healthy people need a  healthy planet. We are marshaling our resources, expertise and convening power to positively impact planetary health while also ensuring  the resilience or our business for generations to come. This commitment includes continually striving to improve the environmental footprint  of our operations, our products and our value chain while working with like-minded partners to tackle today’s global health challenges at  the intersection of human and environmental health. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in February 2022, noted: We now know that a healthy planet  is fundamental to secure a liveable future for people on Earth and that’s why we say that the needs of climate, nature and local communities  have to be considered together and prioritized in decision making and planning—every day and in every region of our world.49 
Our Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) Standards reflect industry best practices and aim to ensure that all  &   entities around the world are compliant with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that they maintain consistently high-quality  EH&S performance in line with our goals and the multiple metrics that we track at every facility and through our supply chain (see section:  Responsible Supply Base). At  & , our commitment to the health of our planet is grounded in   Our Credo values that say we must protect the environment and natural resources we  are privileged to use and is inspired by Our Purpose to change the trajectory of health for  humanity—because we know healthy people need a healthy planet. That is why in addition  to the decades of effort to improve the environmental performance of our business, we also  work with partners to make a difference beyond our value chain, advancing solutions that help  improve the health of people and our planet. Our Goals are aimed at reducing  our carbon footprint and doing our  part to address one of the greatest  global public health challenges  of our time—climate change. In  parallel, we drive improvements  across resource consumption and  product development and packaging  optimizations as part of our ongoing  environmental sustainability activities. * See the EH&S Compliance and Certifications table in the ESG Performance Data section of this Report for  footnote considerations related to EH&S Governance data.  &  is committed to helping mitigate our impact on climate change and climate  change’s impact on our business and society. To do our part to help maintain a healthy climate, we take  a holistic approach that includes improving the footprint of our operation and value chain, supporting  policies that aim to achieve a low-carbon economy, and working with others to drive impact at scale. We have made significant progress against our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals that focus on carbon  neutrality and renewable electricity. We will also continue to engage our upstream suppliers in  emissions reductions associated with our procurement practices and recognize we must continue   at a pace to meet our commitments. Our operational (Scope 1 + Scope 2) emissions goal has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as  being consistent with the reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5°C, and our operational carbon neutrality goal  goes beyond what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Our value  chain (Scope 3) emissions goal has been validated by SBTi as being consistent with a 2°C reduction scenario, and we will be  reevaluating this goal based on the guidance from SBTi issued in 2021. Through our due diligence and continuous improvement process, we are evaluating potential additional sources of  greenhouse gas emissions within our manufacturing processes. We will report additional greenhouse gas emissions, if  material, in future disclosures. Signed four new renewable Power Purchase  Agreements (PPAs)—one in North America   and three in Europe—as well as two Utility   Green Tariff contracts in the U.S.

See the  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions table in the ESG Performance Data section of this Report for additional footnote  considerations related to Scope 3 GHG emissions data. To achieve carbon neutrality, we will make further investments in energy efficiency,  alternative fuel sources and environmentally preferred fleet vehicle choices while  expanding our use of renewable energy. To reduce upstream emissions, we will partner  with our key suppliers to encourage them to reduce their emissions. We will balance  any remaining carbon emissions by supporting solutions that accelerate nature’s ability  to remove carbon from the atmosphere. &  is a signatory of the UN-  backed Race To Zero campaign and SBTi Business  Ambition for 1.5°C, with an ambition to reach net  zero emissions across our value chain by 2045. Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes the top 1% – 2% of EPA SmartWay Partners with a SmartWay Excellence  Award for their achievements. In 2021,  &  received the EPA SmartWay Excellence Award for outstanding environmental  performance and climate-efficient transportation for the eighth time. More than 97% of  &  freight in North America is  transported with SmartWay-registered carriers with a strong record of fuel efficiency and GHG reduction. Capital expenditure for energy efficiency: Energy efficiency programs at our  most energy-intensive manufacturing and R&D sites are allocated up to $40  million per year in capital relief through our CO2 Capital Relief Program, for  energy projects that demonstrate potential CO2 savings and a financial return  of at least 15%. Renewable electricity: Generating and procuring  renewable electricity has been a critical element of our  energy program for two decades. &   maintains more than 50 on-site renewable energy systems  in 17 countries and has executed multiple deals for off-site  renewable electricity procurement. In 2021,  &   signed four new renewable Power Purchase  Agreements (PPAs)—one in North America and three in  Europe—as well as two Utility Green Tariff contracts in the  United States. These agreements, and our prior renewable  electricity efforts, are expected to provide the equivalent  of 100% renewable electricity for our operations in the  United States, Canada and Europe by 2023. * Results from completed projects. Based on fuel and electricity reduction calculations. Avoidance  of energy consumption and GHG emissions were calculated by comparing energy consumption  before project implementation and expected consumption after implementation using engineering  estimates at the time the projects are approved. * Includes site-specific data from all  &  owned and leased sites over 50,000  square feet where  &  has operational control as well as manufacturing and R&D  sites under 50,000 square feet, unless otherwise noted. * Percentage of electricity used by  &  that is generated from renewable sources. Europe includes Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,  Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. North America includes United States and Canada only. Contact lenses made with renewable electricity: With our new renewable  agreements,  &  Vision will be powered entirely with 100%  renewable electricity. That means all ACUVUE brand contact lenses will be  made using 100% renewable electricity, since  &  Vision’s  production site in Limerick, Ireland, is already powered by 100% wind. Expanding solar energy: We continued to expand the installation of on-site  solar arrays at our facilities, with new installations in 2021 in China, Colombia,  South Africa and Thailand. New this year was the introduction of on-site PPA  structure in the form of multiyear “energy as a service” contracts at two sites,  enabling GHG-reduction benefits without the need for capital investment. At one of the largest manufacturing sites in South Africa, the Cape Town  installation represented the first renewable electricity initiative for  &   in South Africa. Reducing carbon emissions by land, air and sea: As part of our ongoing efforts  to leverage data science across our operations, in 2021, we automated a manual  freight load planning process to produce a 3D loading plan that optimizes  space utilization of shipping containers, resulting in lower GHG emissions from  shipping, a faster loading process and cost savings. In Europe, we identified  opportunities to switch deliveries from our Belgium distribution center to  Denmark, France and Spain from air to road—significantly reducing the carbon  emissions with minimal impact to customer service. Eliminating ozone-depleting substances: Chlorofluorocarbons have been  eliminated from use in our facilities for several years. We plan to eliminate  the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by the end of 2025, or earlier  where required by government regulations, and in 2021, all  &   manufacturing sites were required to prepare an HCFC phase-out plan. We continue to pursue  Leadership in Energy &  Environmental Design  (LEED) certification   or equivalents   (for example, Building  Research Establishment Environmental  Assessment Methodology [BREEAM]). In 2021, we added seven LEED certifications  and one recertification across our facilities,  bringing our total at the end of 2021 to 67   LEED-certified and BREEAM-certified    &  sites. More than 9.4   million square feet of  &   workspace is now LEED-certified. Our teams are finding creative ways to supply renewable  energy, both on-site and off-site, to bring us closer to  our climate goals. On the demand side, our designers  and engineers are using innovative technologies and  techniques to decrease the amount of power needed  to run global operations, even as  &   continues to grow. As a leader in the healthcare industry, we’re guided by our  strong sense of purpose, helping people around the world  see better, connect better, live better. That commitment  extends to how we innovate to support the health of the  planet, and that includes making all our contact lenses  with renewable electricity. At  & , we are continuously evaluating climate-related risks and opportunities to  strengthen our business and to ensure that we can continue to meet our patient and customer needs. In 2021, we undertook a focused assessment of the potential physical climate-related risks on our own  properties and certain supplier locations. We identified several opportunities to improve business  resilience such as access to reliable energy and water supply in the event of a disruption that we  will build into our long-range capital planning process. Several projects are planned and budgeted,  including a potable water tank, storm water pumps and additional emergency generation. Partnering for climate action: In 2021, we further engaged in partnerships and coalitions to help make  a positive impact on the health of our climate beyond our value chains. Four examples include: 
•  Becoming a Sustaining Sponsor of the Beyond the Megawatt Initiative of the Clean Energy  Buyers Alliance. This initiative is advancing several projects designed to help mobilize deeper  environmental and social impacts in large customer energy procurement with a target   outcome of contributing to carbon-free energy systems that are resilient, equitable and  environmentally sustainable. signed an open letter with other leading CEOs to show our support for the UK NHS climate plan. •  Aligning with more than 400 corporations and investors to sign an open letter to President Biden  calling for an ambitious U.S. emissions reduction target. The initiative was led by the We Mean  Business Coalition. •  Participating with nine pharmaceutical companies to launch Energize, an initiative to help  decarbonize the global pharmaceutical supply chain. The program aims to educate key industry  suppliers on renewable procurement opportunities and help them in their transition to   renewable energy. * See the Energy Use table in the ESG Performance Data section of this Report for footnote considerations related to Energy Use data. To learn more about our partnerships at the intersection of climate change  and health equity, see Our Race to Health Equity. We continue to advance initiatives across all our facilities and throughout our supply chain to minimize our impacts on the planet  through responsible use of water, avoidance of waste and reduction of waste sent to a landfill. Reusing wastewater in Canada: Our team at our facility in Guelph,   Canada, completed an investment in a skid-mounted wastewater   treatment system that uses reverse osmosis to purify the wastewater. With this new system, the site can reuse nearly all the wastewater   generated during manufacturing to feed boilers for heat in winter and   to support cooling towers in the warmer months. Overall, the site is   expected to reuse approximately 10 million liters of water each year. This initiative won an award from the City of Guelph’s Water Smart   Business Program. Using remediated ground water in Belgium: In 2021, at our facility in Beerse, Belgium, an innovative project helped the   site reduce purchased potable water volumes to the lowest level in 20 years. Traditionally, potable water had been used in   the site’s cooling towers, which consumed large amounts of water, especially in the summer when requirements are highest. After extensive testing and evaluation of a range of processes, a solution that replaced potable water with groundwater from   an on-site soil remediation project was adopted and then supplemented by rainwater captured in the winter season. As a   result, the site was able to reduce water withdrawal from the municipal water grid, helping safeguard potable water levels   supplied for the local community. Aligning with external water and waste standards: As part of our continuous improvement to measure and minimize   our water and waste impacts, we are working toward achieving certification across selected facilities to two industry-  leading tools and standards: 
•  the international Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard, which addresses sustainable water management,   water dependencies and impacts, responsible water procedures, and building relationships with local water-related   stakeholders; and 
•  Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) TRUE Zero Waste certification, a program that rates how well facilities   perform in minimizing their non-hazardous, solid wastes and maximizing their efficiency in the use of resources. In France,  &  started collecting fiber waste generated during  the production of tampons for resale to make floor mops. Previously, these  fibers were incinerated. So far, more than 500,000 mops have been made. We are committed to developing more sustainable products that use fewer and  more sustainable resources to support the health of people and our planet. We  examine product environmental impacts across product categories and platforms. We also examine impacts across all stages of the product lifecycle, including  design, development, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, use and end of  life. We then focus on the product categories, platforms and lifecycle areas with  the highest potential impact and prioritize improvements that can be implemented  across multiple products to enable the greatest possible improvements. Our R&D teams continue to integrate principles of green chemistry and  engineering to develop our medicines. In 2021, for example, for application  in our late-stage product portfolio, we achieved process intensification and  highly efficient processes via biocatalysis and organocatalysis. Biocatalysis and  organocatalysis enable a reduction in the use of organic solvents and generate  lower levels of organic waste, resulting in fewer GHG emissions. In 2021, this new  green chemistry process was introduced at selected  &  sites. We  also collaborate widely with our suppliers to identify and evaluate green chemistry  options across many manufacturing processes. Packaging plays a critical role in maintaining the quality, safety and integrity of  our products throughout our value chain. We comply with applicable packaging  regulations in all the countries where our products are sold while aiming to reduce  overall packaging materials, increase the recycled content of our packaging and  improve recyclability of packaging materials across all our business segments. Specifically, in our Consumer Health business, as part of our Healthy Lives  Mission, we have set goals to reduce packaging waste, and we have driven many  packaging improvements (see section: Consumer Health). Examples from our  Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments include: 
•  Pharmaceutical: For all markets, the plastic trays used in our TREMFYA One  Press line were replaced with a Pulp Injection Molding (PIM) tray. Extensive  testing and evaluation of the material was required to obtain new material  certifications and regulatory approvals, as injection-molded pulp had not been  used previously in pharmaceutical industry packaging. This was a significant  breakthrough in pharmaceutical packaging, particularly since PIM trays can  be disposed of through regular cardboard recycling waste streams, available  in most countries. We aim to convert all our self-injectable device platforms to  PIM trays by 2025. •  MedTech: DePuy Synthes reduced primary packaging weight across a range of  packaging platform solutions, including SYNTRAY, SYNSIGHT and PLATOON,  while also reducing the size of the packages. ETHICON VISTASEAL, a fibrin  sealant for surgical use, was launched with new packaging that is half the size  and half the weight of the original, resulting in a significant reduction in waste  and in storage space. Partnerships for circularity: In 2021, we continued to engage with partners on  projects that advance a circular economy, for example: 
•  The Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council and the Sustainable Healthcare  Coalition, collaborating with industry leaders to increase healthcare recycling,  reduce waste and elevate sustainability in global health systems. •  As a member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and  Associations (EFPIA), companies strive to invent, produce and distribute new  medicines and vaccines in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. One  of the key pillars is to transition to a circular economic model by proactively  innovating and expediting circular principles and remove regulatory blockers  across the pharma value chain. We recognize that the products we create to help patients, doctors and consumers  can have environmental impacts after use. We, therefore, assess the end-of-life and  post-use impacts of our products and develop category-specific action plans to  improve performance over time, as necessary. Pharmaceutical products: We are an active and founding member of the  Antimicrobial Resistance Industry Alliance (AMRIA) and we collaborate across the  industry to address AMR (see section: Antimicrobial Resistance). Pharmaceutical products take-back: In 2021, we relaunched our SAFE RETURNS  program in the U.S. for home-administered immunology products, following a full  redesign of the program to improve convenience and sustainability for patients. A significant feature of the redesigned program is the removal of the hazardous  material classification due to the needle-safe authorization, thereby eliminating  the need for patients to prepare special paperwork for handling by mainstream  postal services. Additionally, the new system uses paper envelopes to return the  devices after use instead of bulky plastic containers that were previously used. We  intend to expand this program to nine countries in Europe in 2022. In parallel, we  are developing our capability to disassemble the collected devices from the SAFE  
RETURNS program to close the loop and reuse or recycle the materials   and components, something that has not yet been fully achieved in the  pharmaceutical industry. MedTech: To reduce the impact of medical device parts in the environment,   J&J MedTech offers reprocessed, single-use devices manufactured by Sterilmed,  Inc., a part of the  &  Family of Companies. In line with local laws,  J&J MedTech also offers reprocessed products from other original manufacturers  as well to provide a broad opportunity for customers to meet their needs in an  environmentally responsible manner. Bronchoscope reprocessing program: With traditional bronchoscopes, the  hospital owns and manages the scope through its entire lifecycle, and the   hospital must reprocess the scope between each clinical case. MONARCH  READY is a novel bronchoscope sustainability program where Auris Health  handles the service, maintenance and reprocessing of bronchoscopes and in  doing so, maximizes the useful life for each bronchoscope while maintaining   the highest standards for quality and device performance. Reprocessing microlumen devices: Medical devices that have complex   features and functionalities make reprocessing of these high-tech products  increasingly challenging. Reprocessing medical devices that contain microlumens,  in particular, have a higher degree of difficulty and risk due to the requirement   of ensuring the lumen is completely clear of all soils and particulates, including  very small 50 micron and larger microparticles that must be cleared to ensure  patient safety. Sterilmed recently developed a new patent-pending test method  for reprocessing microlumen devices that can detect microsized particles to  ensure the lumen is clean and clear for all devices that pass this test—allowing   us to reprocess these devices. Surgical device recycling: Our initial pilot program in one hospital in Germany  to recycle disposable medical instruments designed for single use was expanded  to six clinics in 2021 and will be extended in Germany nationwide. The program  allows hospitals to recycle metal and plastic components from Ethicon single- use surgical instruments while digitally capturing and communicating the  environmental impact of salvaging materials such as steel, titanium, aluminum,  copper and chrome steel as well as a variety of plastics. The recycling initiative is  now being introduced as a pilot in several additional countries across Europe. Javier M., Senior MRP Planner Advanced Therapies, ensured  temperature control throughout the delivery of personalized  CAR-T therapies to cancer patients. Throughout our business, our commitment to science and data-driven decision  making, compliance, integrity and responsible business practices are embedded  across the Enterprise. By accepting personal accountability to uphold Our Credo  values, we create a culture in which everyone supports Our Purpose to profoundly  change the trajectory of health for humanity. We do so in an ethical manner and  through continuous improvement that drives innovation in our systems, processes  and practices. We expect all employees at  &  to help us sustain  the trust earned over the course of 135 years of business operations. Running a  responsible business is an essential driver of value creation, and our stakeholders  expect it. Our approach is to effectively manage ESG risks while delivering value for our  stakeholders. Our commitment to R&D and innovation is key to our important  breakthroughs in health for humanity (see section: R&D Innovation for details of  progress across our diverse innovation channels). Throughout our operations, we  adhere to strict quality standards at every stage of the product lifecycle. We rely  on ethically led, science-driven decision making in all matters relating to medical  safety and strive to protect our patients and consumers from counterfeit and illicit  trade. We are committed to respecting the human rights of individuals throughout  our value chain, including through our supply base by maintaining ethical supplier  standards and sustainable sourcing. Trust is at the heart of our business at  & . Being a trusted corporation, employer, business partner and  provider of high-quality products for our patients and consumers  is critical to our ability to address today’s most pressing health  challenges with bold action and innovative approaches. Without  accountability, there is no trust. That’s why holding ourselves  accountable is a foundational element of our strategy and  essential to our ongoing success. Beyond the innovation we deliver in our Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer  Health business segments (see section: R&D Innovation), innovation underpins  the way we work, the way we manage our operational facilities and the value we  create across every business function. In 2021, as in every year, we advanced  multiple innovations throughout our operations. Some examples follow: 
Advanced manufacturing technologies: In 2021,  &  received  three new World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse designations for its use of  advanced manufacturing technologies. The three designations recognized were: 
•  Vision Care order-fulfillment operations, in London, UK, developed a dynamic  virtual call center that relies on advanced technology such as intelligence-based  call routing and auto answer. The technology anticipates customer reorder  behaviors and reserves lenses for them, which improves customer service levels. •  Consumer Health, in Helsingborg, Sweden, addressed customer needs through  increased agility using digital twins, robotics and high-tech tracking and tracing  to enable volume growth, accelerated time to market and cost reductions,  alongside investments in green tech, to become  & ’s first-ever  carbon neutral facility. •  DePuy Synthes Advance Case Management Lighthouse, in North America,   leveraged open application programming interface architecture, machine- learning algorithms and a suite of digital tools across our hips and knees  restoration implant portfolio value chain. This enabled a reduction of the   number of instrument trays in operating rooms, simplified inventory  management for healthcare providers and shortened the time to set up  operating rooms, saving valuable hospital resources. costs across all product lines. This is the first use in the pharmaceutical industry of  real-time release testing in established batch-manufacturing processes in place of  traditional laboratory release testing and has been approved by the FDA, the EMA  and Health Canada for use in different products. We plan to roll out this innovative  process globally in 2022. Expanding smart manufacturing: Through our collaboration with Microsoft,   & ’s Supply Chain Technology organization continues to  accelerate the efficiency of our processes as part of digital manufacturing  transformation. Using a range of digital and cloud-based capabilities, we  are enabling business innovation and improving agility and disaster recovery  while reducing overall operational costs. See our suite of smart manufacturing  capabilities represented in the graphic below: 
Reducing release times for medicines: Janssen developed and adopted a new  process for real-time product quality release based on surrogate dissolution  modeling. This model calculates the expected dissolution of a tablet without the  need to physically dissolve the tablet in dissolution media, significantly decreasing  release times by up to 50%, reducing the standard deviation of product release  by up to 90%, optimizing inventory levels by up to 15% and reducing operational  
We are in an era of unprecedented product and  process complexity, along with increased customer  expectations and new demand. We are transforming our  manufacturing capabilities to be increasingly connected,  intelligent, lean and networked. Personalized MedTech solutions: We leveraged state-of-the-art solutions  throughout our  &  MedTech manufacturing and supply chain,  following the implementation of innovative manufacturing capabilities at 14 J&J  MedTech sites. Implemented in collaboration with Jabil Healthcare’s Medical  Devices sector, this transformation included personalized medicine solutions,  allowing for the manufacture of implants that are customized for the patient at  several facilities. For example, at our Mezzovico site in Switzerland, operating  surgeons can now provide scans for individual patients that enable the production  of patient-specific craniofacial and mandible implants in less than two days. Improving access to healthcare information:  &  became the  first healthcare company to introduce an Enterprise e-labeling solution based  on the GS1 Digital Link Standard to provide electronic information across the  industry. Initially implemented to support the launch of a key oncology product in  Singapore, scanning a barcode on our product enables users to view its electronic  leaflet containing important healthcare information. Instant digital access to  information enables HCPs to make informed decisions when treating their patients  and contributes to patient safety, enhanced supply chain security, efficiency and  accurate data sharing. &  was ranked #3 for the second  year in a row on the 2021 Supply Chain Top  25 list by Gartner, Inc., which evaluates supply  chains across all industries based on business  and financial data, ESG metrics, and community  opinion of expert analysts and peer votes. In addition, for the fourth year,  &   was named #1 on Gartner’s annual Supply Chain  Top 25: Life Sciences list in recognition of our  supply chain’s commitment to getting ahead  of evolving customer needs while continuously  improving our foundations. Our extended supply base comprises more than 45,300 suppliers across our three business segments. A critically important link in our value  chain,  & ’s supplier network underpins our business continuity and enables us to manufacture and deliver essential products and  services to our patients, consumers and customers. We aim to maintain collaborative and trusting supplier relationships and encourage a broad  diversity of suppliers to work with us. Through our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers, our Supplier Sustainability Program (SSP) and our Global  Supplier Diversity & Inclusion program, we manage our supply base in line with Our Credo values. * Represents spend we have control over/addressable spend, defined as products and services that  procurement teams can negotiate with suppliers to meet business goals. Supply chain organizations are poised to  drive meaningful growth for their companies  as they improve digital capabilities across  operations, enhance resilience to respond  nimbly to inevitable challenges and build full  transparency into all aspects of the supply  chain. At  & , we invest in   these capabilities across our complex   supply network. 1. Providing training to  &  employees   who travel overseas on business to explain how to spot   and report potential instances of human trafficking. 2. Linking performance on diversity metrics to business   awards in select contracts, including Tier 2 procurement   from minority suppliers. We enroll suppliers in our SSP based on a number of risk metrics as well as the  size of their business with us. The SSP requires, among other things, suppliers  to conform to our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers, and all suppliers in  the program regularly complete an assessment by EcoVadis, a recognized  provider of business sustainability ratings for global supply chains. See section  on Responsible Supply Base for details on our progress towards our Supplier  Sustainability Program 2025 Goal. Auditing supplier site compliance: We verify supplier site compliance with   laws and regulations as well as with other policies, including our Responsibility  Standards for Suppliers and our Position on Human Rights, through our EH&S  audit program and SSP. Our EH&S audit program, which has been in place since  2006, is conducted using the audit protocol and checklist developed by the  Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI). Our social audits program, part  of our SSP, is conducted in accordance with Supplier Ethical Data Exchange  (Sedex) Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 4-Pillar guidelines and is focused  on human and labor rights. In 2021, we completed 124 EH&S audits, the majority  in Asia, and 11 social audits. Our audit programs in 2021 continued to be affected  by COVID-19, mostly due to travel restrictions, minimizing in-person site visits  and limited resources at suppliers to support audits. We continued to leverage  virtual audits using video and other online tools. Building supplier capabilities through our SSP: In 2021, we launched our  Onward Sustainability Program, part of our SSP, to focus on direct engagement  with suppliers to explain our requirements and how they can best meet them. Replacing our previous static supplier toolkit, Onward is an engaging and  broad-reaching series of webinars and materials in which  & ’s  procurement and sustainability subject matter experts partner with the British  Standards Institution to host best-practice sharing sessions on topics relating to  our goals and objectives. The program is ongoing but has included sessions on  sustainability basics, starting a supplier sustainability program and how to host  an audit. The live sessions and materials directly reach more than 1,000 suppliers  in our SSP and are available anytime to all our suppliers in our Supplier Quality  Academy. In 2021, we delivered five Onward Sustainability Program sessions, in  which more than 1,000 attendees from 45 different countries participated. Engaging suppliers in innovation:  &  has created a Supplier- Enabled Innovation Program that allows us to generate innovative solutions  from our supply base to solve our greatest business challenges to profoundly  change the trajectory of health for humanity. We have created processes to  spark innovation from our supply base, both through our Supplier Management  Program and by posting a challenge in our supplier-enabled innovation  technology platform. In early 2021, the  &  Procurement  organization held its first-ever Supplier-Enabled Innovation Awards event,  recognizing the top innovations from these programs in 2020. Partners  recognized in our awards program for their top innovations include: 
As part of our own commitment to reduce our Scope 3 emissions, the CDP  Supply Chain program is another part of the SSP that requires our suppliers to be  transparent about their supply chain impacts by publicly disclosing to CDP their  environmental performance, including GHG emissions and water use. We make  this a requirement of our largest emitting suppliers in the program, and the strong  participation of our suppliers earned recognition for  &  in 2021,  when we were named to the CDP Supplier Engagement leader board for the fifth  consecutive year. For us, sustainability spans a wide range of opportunities:  economic, social and environment. In order to have the  long-lasting, positive impact that all of our stakeholders  deserve, we work closely with our global supplier  community to amplify and expand our reach. Together,   we can accomplish so much for our collective future. 82% of invited suppliers participated in the  CDP Supply Chain Climate Program, and  75% of invited suppliers participated in the  CDP Supply Chain Water Program. •  A biotechnology company that helped us incorporate a plant-derived material  in our COVID-19 vaccine production, resulting in increased manufacturing  volumes and other improvements;   
•  Our clinical trial network to improve enrollment of diverse patients in clinical  trials through use of novel data science approaches that identify outbreak  hot spots and encourage trial participation, especially with difficult-to-enroll  minority populations; and  
•  A supplier to create a first-to-market recycling solution for single-use medical  devices, enabling safe reuse of tons of materials that would otherwise have  been incinerated or landfilled. The awards program will be conducted annually to continue to recognize and  celebrate the top Supplier-Enabled Innovations. Surveying clinical trial partners: External clinical trial partners are a crucial  link in our drug development process and play an important role in partnering  with  &  to increase patient diversity in our clinical trials. This  year, we conducted a survey covering 12 clinical suppliers spanning nine service  categories to better understand the expertise, performance and behaviors  across our partnerships. With insights from the survey, which received hundreds  of responses, we are able to lead productive conversations, strengthen our  relationships and reinforce targeted improvements in the design and execution of  our clinical studies, with a particular focus on increasing patient diversity. Partnerships for Good: As one of our Health for Humanity 2025 Goals, in June  2020, in solidarity with the Association of National Advertisers and the Alliance  for Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing,  &  signed a petition  holding ourselves accountable to aggressively pursue equity in advertising and  marketing. We collaborated with three agency holding companies and global  media partners to adopt microcharters that support our DEI objectives. DEI  metrics are now included in our agencies’ year-end evaluations, and pay-for- performance compensation models measure and reward the impact of our efforts. Over the past year, with our agency partners, we introduced training and updated  hiring practices and equitable content creation at each organization, helping  drive better representation of consumers and supporting growth for diverse  businesses. Overall, our diverse media spend increased in 2021. Additionally in  2021, we confirmed a collaboration with American Express Global Business Travel  to develop a training for business travelers to explain how to spot and report  potential instances of human trafficking. See section on Responsible Supply Base  for details on our progress towards our Partnerships for Good 2025 Goal. Our Global Supplier Diversity & Inclusion program provides a platform for  proactive outreach to diverse and small suppliers, collaboration with partners  advancing supplier diversity, and guidance to suppliers on how to engage with   & . Now in the third decade of this program, we continue to  realize the value that an inclusive supply base brings to our business, our people,  our innovation, our markets and our communities. We have expanded our global  footprint to 19 markets, with the addition of India and Turkey. For the 11th consecutive year,   &  maintained  membership in the Billion Dollar  Roundtable, a group of companies  that advance best practices for  supplier diversity, and that spend  at least $1 billion (Tier 1) annually  with certified minority-, women-,  veteran-, LGBT- and disabled- owned businesses. We also became  a founding member of the European  Gay and Lesbian Chamber of  Commerce, the umbrella organization of the European LGBTIQ Chambers of  Commerce, to grow spend with suppliers from this important community. Several notable advances were made in 2021 as we exceeded  our ambitious goal of $4.5 billion in Global Impact Spend by  2025. Examples include: 
•  Expanding the coverage of our Buy Diverse, a digital capability initiative  that increases the visibility of diverse suppliers in our purchasing technology  platform, eMarketplace. In 2021, we significantly increased the number of  diverse suppliers in the U.S. and South Africa and expanded the program to  Brazil and China. We now have more than half of our diverse suppliers   included and a footprint in all regions. In 2021,  &  exceeded   $2 billion procurement spend with Tier 1  diverse suppliers globally for the first time. In the U.S., we achieved $2.2 billion;  and outside the U.S., spend totaled $670  million, the result of targeted efforts in our  international markets. •  Hosting an inaugural  &  dedicated global virtual  matchmaking event in partnership with six advocacy organizations that are part  of the National Business Inclusion Consortium (NBIC). We partnered with the  National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), a key advocacy partner that  is also part of the consortium, to co-host the event. The advocacy organizations  recommended diverse businesses for  &  to evaluate based on  business requirements we provided them. As a result, we held discussions with  100 certified diverse businesses and moved more than half of them forward in  our procurement process. This was not only an effective approach for supplier  discovery, but also established a best practice for the industry. With over 100 meetings conducted between diverse suppliers  and  &  category leads, we were able to  yet again increase opportunity for the diverse business  community and showcase the commitment we at NGLCC and  our partners at  &  have to supplier diversity. •  Focusing on social enterprises, which are businesses that make a social  impact while delivering products or services. As an example, Auticon is a  social enterprise in Europe that employs people on the autism spectrum, a  population that has an 85% unemployment rate. Auticon supports our Global  Strategic Insights category using neurodiverse consultants in the data and  analytics field to drive outstanding business results. The unique talents of  their consultants include strong attention to detail and accuracy. At the   same time, their consultants help break down biases towards people   with this condition. •  Building new advocacy partnerships with 14 NGO partners outside the  U.S., including supporting research in 2021 to build advocacy infrastructure  in Europe for minority business enterprises and social enterprises. In  addition,  &  is a member of the NJ CEO Council and of the  Billion Dollar Roundtable Black-Owned Business Healthcare Collaborative. •  Driving diverse spend transparency by expanding our reporting of our  detailed diverse supplier spend to our major customers. Such reporting  allows our customers to recognize the impact of their spend on diverse and  small businesses through their value chain and helps them achieve their own  supplier diversity objectives. In addition, working with our supplier partners,  we increased their Tier 2 diverse spend reporting to us. Across our business, we source commodities and  raw materials in multiple categories. Some of  these require heightened procurement focus due  to critical environmental or biodiversity concerns  or elevated human rights risks in the supply chain. We collaborate with supply chain partners to  understand the potential risks and impacts of our  procurement activities in these areas and define  appropriate standards and controls in responsible  sourcing of commodities and materials of  concern. Forest partnerships: We maintain multiple  multiyear forest partnerships to enable the  protection of tropical rainforests that are critical  for climate mitigation, wildlife conservation and  long-term community well-being. In 2021, we scored A- for palm oil and a B  for timber for our CDP Forests disclosures,  maintaining our position from 2020 as one of  the few companies worldwide that disclose  to this important CDP framework addressing  deforestation impacts. Habitats protected or restored: In 2021, we invested in two forest partnerships  to enable the protection of tropical rainforests linked to our upstream supply  chain to maximize benefits to biodiversity and local communities. •  In Sumatra, Indonesia, we supported a market-driven approach to forest  restoration and protection of more than 38,000 hectares of rainforest led by the  World Wildlife Fund. •  In Loreto, Peru, we invested in a forest conservation initiative with the Forest  Conservation Fund to prevent the deforestation of 10,000 hectares of pristine   rainforest. Wood-fiber products:  &  is committed to more responsible  sourcing of wood-fiber products. We partner with the Rainforest Alliance to  engage our suppliers and implement our Responsible Wood-Fiber Product  Sourcing Policy. Palm oil: We support the production and responsible use of palm oil through the  implementation of our Responsible Palm Oil Sourcing Policy. We partner with  the Earthworm Foundation and Action for Sustainable Derivatives to build supply  chain transparency and monitor nonconformance to our commitments. Conflict minerals: As members of the Responsible Minerals Initiative and in line  with regulatory requirements, we remain committed to taking steps to determine  the use, country of origin and source of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold in our  global product portfolio. Our Board of Directors oversees our Company in alignment with Our Credo  values, enabling us to put the patients we serve first and create value for society  while maintaining a thriving business. Our governance structure, policies and  processes are designed to serve the needs of our business, our shareholders  and other stakeholders, and to promote a culture of accountability across the  Enterprise. Our Board of Directors remains accessible to all stakeholders and   can be contacted via several channels. We are a signatory to the Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles 2.0  and are committed to using these standards to inform  & ’s  corporate governance practices. The Commonsense Principles 2.0 aspire to  promote a constructive dialogue on good corporate governance for the benefit  of millions of Americans who work for and invest in America’s public companies. We maintain information and resources relating to corporate governance on our  corporate website, including our Principles of Corporate Governance, governance  structures, Board Charters, organizational documents and all SEC filings. Our Enterprise Risk Management Framework provides a systematic process for  our management teams and employees to identify, assess and manage business  risks, and for our Board to oversee risk management. ESG matters are regular topics on the agenda of our Board of Directors. The  Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee reviews annual progress  against our Health for Humanity strategy and goals, initiatives advanced by the  Enterprise Governance Council, the governance body for ESG, and our overall  sustainability efforts. Other Committees of the Board oversee specific ESG risks  and opportunities (see section: Sustainability Governance). Following our announcement in 2021 of a significant change to our corporate  governance, Alex Gorsky,  & ’s Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer since 2012, assumed the role of Executive Chairman of  &  , effective January 3, 2022. At the same time, Joaquin Duato, Vice  Chairman of the Company’s Executive Committee, assumed the role of Chief  Executive Officer, with members of the Executive Committee reporting to him. Joaquin Duato was also appointed as a member of  & ’s Board  of Directors, effective January 3, 2022. In 2021,  & ’s Board of Directors regularly engaged with  management to further formalize our ESG strategy and participated in our 2022  PTA. The Board also conducted a comprehensive review of its charter and  agendas in 2021, as well as the charter and agendas of each Committee, to ensure  that the Board or a Committee was responsible for each of the significant ESG  topics identified in our latest PTA. Robust corporate governance is the key to long-term value  creation for all stakeholders. Corporations in today’s world  must not only do the right thing, they must also have the full  engagement of directors and company leadership in fostering  a compliant, ethical, accountable and transparent culture and  practice. Our Board of Directors has engaged in thoughtful long- term succession planning, and the transitioning of the  Chief Executive Officer role demonstrates the strength of  that process as well as our depth of talent at the executive  management level to drive the Company’s continued   growth and success. Additionally, following the appointment of Joaquin Duato, and the planned  retirement of two Executive Committee members (Michael Sneed and Dr. Paul  Stoffels), we announced four new Executive Committee appointments, effective  January 3, 2022: 
•  William N. Hait, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of  &  External  Innovation, was appointed Executive Vice President, Chief External Innovation,  Medical Safety and Global Public Health Officer. We aim for a diverse membership of our Board of Directors in order to benefit  from different backgrounds, expertise and perspectives in addressing the   needs of our global patient and consumer base. Our responsibilities to patients, consumers, HCPs, employees, communities  and shareholders are embedded in Our Credo. Our comprehensive policies,  procedures and training programs help our employees and contingent workers  comply with applicable laws, regulations and industry codes as well as the  Company’s internal standards and expectations for responsible conduct. We use our biennial Our Credo Survey to assess how our values come to   life across the Enterprise. Our next Our Credo Survey is in 2022. Our Code of Business Conduct (CBC) and Health Care Compliance (HCC)   policies list comprehensive ethical standards for decisions and actions in   every market where we operate. Mandatory CBC training is conducted every   two years, and HCC training is conducted each year. All new employees are  assigned and required to complete CBC, HCC and other relevant required  training. In our policies, we comprehensively address anti-corruption and anti- bribery, following the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act   2010, and other applicable local anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and  regulations. Similarly, we value transparency as a key component of building  trust with all those engaged with our business and aim to comply with multiple  regulatory reporting requirements in different jurisdictions around the world   as well as publishing a wide range of voluntary disclosures to meet the   information needs of our diverse stakeholder groups. * Certifiers include senior leaders at VP2 level and above, selected Managing Directors and General Managers based on country or business segment risk profile, and executives of recently acquired companies. of assigned employees  completed CBC training. of senior leaders certified*  the compliance of their  organizations with the CBC. of employees believe leaders  demonstrate that integrity,  quality and compliance are  top priorities through their  words and actions (2021 Our  Voice Survey). Our participation required a comprehensive review of our anti-corruption  program, including governance and controls in our HCC program as well as in  the areas of supply chain, finance, procurement, mergers and acquisitions, and  human resources across all sectors and business functions. While our overall score  ranked highly in the benchmark relative to other industry participants, we took the  opportunity to engage in discussion and learn of possible additional best practices  that could be relevant for  & . Maintaining our focus on bioethical decision making: To address the complex  ethical questions arising in the field of biological research, science and medicine,  our global  &  Bioethics Committee (JJBC) serves as an advisory  body to our global teams on ethical issues. In 2021, JJBC provided guidance to  multiple teams on ethical questions related to research, access to investigational  medicines, data transparency and more. JJBC also conducted workshops  covering bioethics principles and mentoring sessions for colleagues interested in  bioethics careers. We continued to actively engage externally to discuss important  bioethical issues. For example, we sponsor the Harvard Multi-Regional Clinical  Trials Bioethics Collaborative and an innovative, multistakeholder bioethics  colloquium convened by New York University (NYU) and the New York   Academy of Sciences. Promoting animal welfare: As an important part of our bioethical approach and  policies, we continued to uphold the ethical and humane treatment of animals  used in laboratory settings and promote the use of non-animal alternatives  whenever feasible, including through regulation. Within our organization, we  run annual 3Rs Awards that recognize the commitment of  &   teams to 3R principles for ethical use of animals in testing—reducing, refining  and replacing their use whenever possible in R&D. In 2021, for example, via our  Best of Sector 3Rs Award, we recognized our Consumer Health team in China  for successfully engaging with Chinese Health Authorities on alternative in vitro  models that could help reduce animal testing of cosmetics in the country. Through close collaboration with industry, the Consumer Health team created  training materials, consolidated validation data on animal alternative models, and  helped shape regulatory acceptance to permit alternative models for cosmetics  in China. In 2021, the China Cosmetic Product Safety Evaluation Guidance was  published and included in vitro methodologies and other safety assessment  approaches, enabling Chinese producers to waive animal studies in the cosmetic  registration process and paving the way to reduce animal testing for cosmetic  products in China. Collaborating on external research assessments: Since 2014, we have been  working with the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project to enable a  consistent approach for assessing external research proposals requesting the  
use of clinical trial data generated by  &  companies. As of 2021,  252 research proposals have been reviewed and 56 articles published using  data shared through the YODA Project, enabling researchers to build on existing  findings to accelerate research that leads to improvements in public health. Since 2015, we have collaborated with   NYU School of Medicine to support Janssen  decision making for investigational medicine  requests, also known as “compassionate   use” or “pre-approval access.” The  Compassionate Use Advisory Committee  (CompAC), comprised of ethicists, physicians  and patient representatives independently  selected by NYU, provides guidance to  Janssen on pre-approval access plans and  individual requests received at Janssen. CompAC affirms  & ’s  commitment to ensuring a transparent,  ethical and objective approach to   reviewing compassionate use requests. Nationwide opioid settlement agreement: In July 2021, we announced the  finalization of a nationwide settlement agreement to resolve opioid-related claims  and litigation in the U.S.  &  confirmed its contribution of up to $5  billion to the settlement, depending on the number of state and local governments  that elect to opt in to the agreement. In February 2022, we confirmed that there  was a sufficient level of participation to move forward with the nationwide  settlement agreement to resolve opioid-related claims and litigation by states,  cities, counties, and other subdivisions in the U.S.  &  no longer  sells prescription opioid medications in the U.S. as part of our ongoing efforts to  focus on transformational innovation and serving unmet patient needs. Enhancing the effectiveness of HCC training: As part of our process of  continuously improving our training tools to further enhance compliance across  the Enterprise, we introduced a new interactive platform to deliver HCC training  in a virtual setting. The platform includes 64 new HCC situational business/ compliance case study discussions. We also introduced new methods to evaluate  the effectiveness of our mandatory annual Enterprise HCC training. The methods  evaluate learning and learning transfer by providing statistical evidence that  employees understand the content of the training. Our 2021 final assessment  indicates that the results of the test are the product of consistent learning  behavior, that they are highly defensible, and that learners demonstrated mastery  of the subject matter. Revising Our Credo escalation procedure: At  & , one way we  build our culture of integrity and accountability is by requiring employees to report  actual or potential violations of our policies or the law as well as risks that could  jeopardize our reputation. The escalation procedure outlines those responsibilities,  including what should be reported, in what timeframe, and the process for  reporting. In 2021, we revised our escalation procedure and communicated it  broadly to all employees, emphasizing that every employee is empowered to  speak up on any matter relating to ethical conduct or compliance. Spotlighting compliance and ethics: Our annual Compliance and Ethics Week  offers an opportunity to reinforce an overall culture of compliance across our  organization. During this week, among activities in all our regions, we launched  a bespoke initiative themed “2021 Ignite Compliance—Doing the right thing the  right way” across Southeast Asia (SEA), with multiple interactive sessions and  interviews with senior leaders, tailored to the needs of each market in the region. Additionally, we expanded our efforts to external business partners, continuing to  increase awareness of HCC, anti-corruption laws and conflicts of interest across  Third Party Intermediaries (TPIs). Our focus on TPI compliance extends well  beyond SEA; however, in 2021, we adapted the Advanced Medical Technology  Association (AdvaMed) Distributor Toolkit to create a proprietary, broader   &  TPI Compliance Toolkit for global use, with the purpose of  enabling TPIs to better self-assess the maturity and completeness of their own  compliance programs and to strengthen their programs where needed. New anti-corruption benchmark: We completed the Transparency International  UK (TI-UK) Corporate Anti-Corruption Benchmark, which is designed and  verified by independent experts selected by TI-UK and includes meeting the legal  requirements of the UK Bribery Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. * OPDP: Office of Prescription Drug Promotion; and APLB: Advertising and Promotional Labeling Branch of the FDA Center for Biologics  Evaluation and Research. *  &  Triage Committee and case investigators have the ability to change the issue type of cases upon receipt in Our Credo  Integrity Line. This occurs for 5% or fewer of cases. Political giving: At the beginning of the 117th Congress (2021 – 2022),  &   paused all political contributions for a further review of our giving policies  and criteria. While we have always maintained stringent political giving criteria to  govern our contributions, in 2021, we undertook an extensive review of our   corporate political giving program and the  &  Political Action  Committee ( &  PAC) to ensure that both are positioned to fulfill  their mission in support of Our Credo by including a revised giving criteria for agile  decision making. With revised giving criteria in place, we reinstated our corporate  political giving program and  &  PAC contributions. Supporting voting rights: We believe that all eligible Americans should be able   to exercise freely, fairly and safely their right to vote, regardless of their race or  ethnicity. The act of voting remains a fundamental way to make our voices heard  on the most important issues of our time, and there cannot be laws that implement  barriers to exercising this most basic right. &  fully supports an  inclusive democratic process that facilitates safe access to voting, and as both   an employer and a member of the communities we serve, we actively support   and encourage participation in the voting process. In the spring of 2021, we were   proud to join hundreds of corporations and others in signing a statement in support   of democracy, opposing legislation that would make it harder for people to vote. The statement was published in leading media outlets in the U.S.  
 &  was named in 2021   for the fourth consecutive year to the   CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political   Disclosure and Accountability with Trendsetter  status, indicating transparency in political   contributions disclosure and accountability.  &  has a longstanding commitment to respecting human rights that is embedded in Our Credo and reflected throughout  our organization in the way we conduct business. Our approach to human rights is outlined in both our Position on Human Rights and our  Responsibility Standards for Suppliers; it is also reflected in our related ESG Policies and Positions and annual regulatory disclosures. The   &  Enterprise Human Rights Governance Council (EHRGC) leads our global approach to human rights due diligence and  management in our own operations and supply chain. The EHRGC is comprised of a cross-functional group of senior leaders representing  legal, procurement, supply chain, global public health, human resources, sustainability, ESG and government affairs organizations. In 2021, BSR worked in collaboration with  &  to create a human rights strategic  framework that was informed by both external and internal stakeholder insights. The framework  further evolves  & ’s approach to human rights and will serve as a key tool to  guide how the Company integrates and operationalizes human rights across its business. Highlights from  &  ’s long history of  taking action to respect and  promote human rights in our  own operations and across  our value chain Our Position on Employment and Labor  Rights articulates our expectations for  labor and employment practices at our  sites, including preventing forced labor  and child labor and non-discrimination,  among other matters. Our operating  companies are required to respect each  employee’s right to make an informed  decision, free of coercion, about  membership in associations and/or labor  unions. Employees have the right to  organize or join associations and bargain collectively, if they so choose. The Company and its operating companies are required to bargain in   good faith with these associations. Human rights in our supply base: All  &  suppliers are  expected to adhere to our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers, which includes  expectations relating to human and labor rights, among other topics. In 2021, we  took a range of actions to identify and address human rights impacts across our  supply base, such as: 
•  Enhancing our focus on human rights due diligence in an effort to integrate it  more deeply into our procurement practices through our Working Group on  Human Rights in our Supply Base;  
•  Conducting in-depth category and commodity human rights assessments in  order to gain greater multi-tier visibility in high-risk supply chains for improved  human rights impact management; and  
•  Increasing our supplier training and capability-building efforts, including   the launch of our Onward Sustainability Program, a platform where we share  good practices on a range of topics such as human rights, and a post-audit  engagement process to encourage suppliers to conduct human rights   due diligence. Enhancing our human rights grievance mechanism: The  &   Our Credo Integrity Line—a grievance mechanism available to all employees,  suppliers and other business partners—offers a secure mechanism for anonymous  reporting, where permitted, of suspected concerns or potential violations of   our policies or the law, including potential human rights violations. In order to  ensure that we appropriately and efficiently address human rights within Our  Credo Integrity Line, we created a separate category for those who wish to   make an inquiry or report a complaint that involves a potential or actual   human rights impact (see section: Ethics & Compliance for our 2021   Our Credo Integrity Line results). Building employee knowledge and capabilities: All  &   employees have a role to play in respecting human rights. Our Foundational  Human Rights Learning and Education Course was rolled out in 2021 in 26  languages to targeted employees globally. In recognition of Global Human Rights  Day in December, we promoted this course to all employees to drive further  awareness and uptake. In 2022, the course will be mandatory for employees in  Procurement, and we will continue to target the training to additional employees  who play a key role in delivering on our human rights commitments. External engagement and collective action: For ongoing support in upholding  human rights, we work in collaboration with specialist human rights organizations,  and we are a member of Shift’s Business Learning Program and of BSR’s Human  Rights Working Group. In 2021, we worked with Shift—a leading center of  expertise on the UNGPs—to gather insights and build on our knowledge of  grievance mechanisms and access-to-remedy best practices, which will inform  our approach going forward. &  is also a member of both  industry-wide and issue-specific forums that share good practices and drive  collective progress, including the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative, AIM- Progress and the Responsible Minerals Initiative. Enhancing our strategic approach to human rights: 2021 marked the 10th  anniversary of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs),  representing a timely opportunity to reflect on the evolution of international efforts  to respect human rights in company value chains and to consider ways in which  we at  &  can further strengthen our approach to human rights. To  achieve this, our EHRGC engaged BSR to support  &  to evolve  our human rights strategy. Together with BSR, we conducted an enterprise-level  gap analysis of our human rights approach in relation to the UNGPs, reviewed  our existing priority focus areas and emerging human rights topics, and gathered  insights from interviews with senior leaders at  &  and external  stakeholders. With these inputs, we held internal workshops with key stakeholders  to further develop and define a long-term strategic framework that will shape our  human rights priority focus areas and action plans. Human rights in our own operations: We continued to strengthen our approach  to due diligence in order to identify, assess and address potential and actual  human rights impacts across  & ’s operations globally. We  conducted human rights audits at key sites using the Supplier Ethical Data  Exchange (Sedex) Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) best practice guidance  and measurement criteria. In addition, our Human Resources organization  implemented a program to enhance fair labor practices in our own operations,  focused on living wage and hours of work: 
•  Living wage: Since 2020, we have embedded an annual living wage assessment  into standard compensation processes with the aim for all employees in our  operations globally to receive pay that is competitive in their local markets and  sufficient to support a sustainable standard of living for them and their families. The annual assessment in 2021 was undertaken, with living wage rates provided  by BSR, and fewer wage gaps were identified compared with the 2020 analysis. As a result, a small number of wage adjustments were made. •  Excessive hours: In 2021, we examined the potential risk of excessive work  hours for employees in our operations. Our assessment included an evaluation  of hours worked in specific sites. The findings from this assessment will inform  the development of a global guideline to limit work hours to 60 hours per week  (including overtime) for wage employees, in line with International Labour  Organization conventions. and facilitate speedier investigation and response times to complaints received. By  the end of 2021, Envision, incorporating Language Weaver, was being used widely  across the Enterprise, translating more than 66 million words during the year  across almost 150 languages, enabling patients and consumers to make their voice  heard in their own language. Activating our annual Quality Month: This  year, our annual Quality Month ran under the  theme “Great Customer Experiences Start  With Quality,” demonstrating our unwavering  commitment to providing high-quality  experiences to our patients, consumers and  customers—all while having fun. Thousands  of  &  employees joined  virtual workshops, training and interactive  educational sessions. As the world’s largest and most broadly based healthcare company,  &   reaches patients and consumers across the world with our medicines,  medical technologies and consumer health products. Their safety when using  our products is a critical priority for  & : we insist on quality and  safety at every stage of product development, manufacturing, supply chain and  commercialization to ensure our products are as effective and safe as possible. Our Quality and Compliance organization has a strategy  focused on the future of healthcare—greater digital  enablement, personalization, customization and speed. In this evolving world, it’s not enough to focus on delivering  the highest quality and safety standards. We must also drive  the highest quality experiences for patients, consumers  and customers in this increasingly interconnected and  personalized world. The  &  Quality Policies and Standards across our Family of  Companies cover the lifecycle of our products from R&D to the consumer and  patient experience. They provide a framework and common foundation of quality  expectations and help ensure a reliable supply of high-quality products across  all our business segments into the markets we serve. In 2021, we continued to  assess and improve our internal quality policies and standards to keep pace with  the changing regulatory demands for our diverse portfolio of products. Areas of  progress we made include:  
Supporting regulatory innovation: As one of nine companies participating in the  FDA Digital Health Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Pilot Program, we helped  the program move to the next stage by evaluating and providing feedback on a  Key Performance Indicator used in the proposed model. The Pre-Cert Program  aims to accelerate the speed of medical devices software solutions to the U.S.  market. The program will grant streamlined product regulatory reviews for digital  health technology companies that demonstrate and maintain a culture of quality  and organizational excellence. We also joined other industry leads in the Medical  Device Innovation Consortium Digital Health Initiative to work with the FDA in  developing innovative regulatory pathways for organizations to plan for easy and  efficient product submissions and notifications while meeting high product quality  and safety standards. Improving data security for Quality & Compliance professionals: We  commenced deployment of our new proprietary Compliance Insights Application  (CIA) technology framework that simplifies the digital experience for our Quality &  Compliance professionals. CIA provides a validated way of handling highest-level  privacy data within our data science apps, giving strong protection for sensitive  data. It also ensures a scalable means to publish datasets and data science  applications as well as simplified methods for the management of access rights  of users. This program was developed in-house by  &  technical  experts and is now being expanded for use as part of our Pharmaceutical sector  Quality & Compliance toolkit. For additional information on our data protection  efforts, see section: Information Security & Data Privacy. Digitalizing our processes: We continue to leverage the latest technology,  including AI, data science and intelligent automation to digitalize our processes  for greater efficiency and improved outcomes for patients and consumers. Automating documentation processes reduces the cycle time to get products  to our customers while creating a digital record and database for process  monitoring and evaluation. For example, in 2021, we automated the sterile release  quality control procedure at DePuy Synthes. Using optical character recognition  technology to convert text images to accessible electronic information, we were  able to automate quality control against predefined acceptance criteria. Improving processing of complaints: We expanded the use of a new product  complaint solution called Envision. A key feature of the application is the ability to  translate patient and consumer complaints from different languages using a tool  called Language Weaver, avoiding the need for manual translations of complaints  received. Language Weaver uses AI technology to optimize linguistic performance

The Consumer Health product quality recall rate is inclusive of Consumer Health products from the  Self-Care over-the-counter (OTC) business segment. It does not represent Essential Health and Skin  Health/Beauty business segment products, including the voluntary recall of certain aerosol sunscreen  products in 2021. Patient and consumer well-being is a priority in our decision making and actions. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO) leads medical safety globally  at  & , championing bioethical principles and people-centered,  evidence- and science-based decisions across our three business segments. Our work is underpinned by a single medical safety standard to which all our  products are held, supported by defined policies and processes. RWD enhances  our understanding of the safety and effectiveness of our medicines and medtech  products outside clinical trial settings. In partnership with leading organizations,  OCMO advances novel methodologies and tools to further inform clinical and  regulatory decision making and advance public health. Supporting healthcare for women: OCMO’s Health of Women and Global  Epidemiology teams came together in 2021 to establish the  &   Pregnancy and Lactation Advisory Group (JJ-PAL). With the knowledge that  pregnant and lactating women are historically understudied, we saw the need  
Progress: Achieved publication of insights from 7,500   women in seven original publications with a research focus   in two main areas: 
for a dedicated effort to provide guidance to clinical teams in characterizing the  benefit–risk profile of products used during pregnancy and lactation. JJ-PAL   now advises clinical development teams as they envision evidence-based  activities in pregnant and lactating women. Guidance provided to several teams  has resulted in updates to protocols, regulatory strategy or amendment of clinical  study documents. Improving maternal health among Black mothers: In alignment with our ambition  to improve maternal health equity (see section: Our Race to Health Equity),  OCMO continues to foster multistakeholder collaborations with academic  institutions, policymakers, community organizations and Black mothers in the  U.S. state of Georgia to advance maternal health equity. This new public–private  collaborative approach engages more than 25 organizations and supports Black  researchers and community groups who are leading these important projects. We  also partnered with Accenture, Microsoft and the Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies  Coalition of Georgia to initiate Hack4Equity, a hackathon that convened 250  innovators to crowdsource solutions to address maternal morbidity and mortality. Three awardees received expert technical support and funding to advance their  proposed solutions that included providing quality education and access to care  for expectant mothers and an app to match mothers with certified doulas and  other resources such as childcare and transportation. Ongoing medical safety excellence during COVID-19: Among our highest  priorities during the pandemic have been uninterrupted and effective monitoring  and ongoing safety evaluation of our products. Advanced methods and tools were  developed by OCMO epidemiology teams as part of our COVID-19 vaccine safety  surveillance program. The tools included rapid analysis of RWD to complement  vaccine safety information from clinical trials and spontaneous case reports once  the vaccine became available to the public. These analyses improved our ability  to respond more rapidly to potential safety signals and manage the benefit–risk  profile of the vaccine to help keep people as safe as possible. OCMO also co-led  efforts to maximize the use of modeling of the regional spread of the pandemic to  identify those at the highest risk of COVID-19, including diverse populations, to  aid in clinical trial recruitment with representation of those at the highest risk of  severe disease. Focusing on child safety: We advanced initiatives focusing on the safety of older  children who may be self-medicating and younger children who are at risk of  accidental unsupervised ingestions of medicine. •  OCMO and our Consumer Health teams partnered with Scholastic to develop  a cross-curricular program and platform with educational resources to teach  youth about OTC medicine safety. •  We partnered with the nonprofit organization Safe Kids Worldwide to  implement a medication safety program providing research and practical tools  and tips for parents about the safe storage and dosing of medicine. •  We announced the awardee of the Pill Protect QuickFire Challenge: Designing  for Medication Safety, which we introduced with JLABS with support from the  Scientific Education and Patient Advocacy and in coordination with the CDC  PROTECT Initiative. Promoting patient preference studies: We are co-leading the Innovative  Medicines Initiative PREFER project, a five-year project to establish  recommendations for industry regulatory authorities and Health Technology  Assessment bodies on the use of patient preferences in medicinal product  decision making. PREFER is providing the pharmaceutical, medical device  and vaccine industries with recommendations for framing decisions based on  patient preference studies. Patient preference studies are a dynamic field with  considerable ongoing methodological research and numerous questions that must  be addressed for regulatory applications. The methods involved in preference  studies are technically complex and still novel for many in healthcare and medical  treatment development, making the PREFER initiative a crucial one for leveraging  the patient voice to improve health outcomes. The PREFER framework and  recommendations are expected to be qualified by European regulators, providing  official recognition of PREFER’s patient preference study framework. &   co-defined PREFER, serves on its steering committee and leads several  key components of the project. Talc safety: We continue to address allegations that JOHNSON’S Baby Powder  can cause adverse health effects. We sympathize deeply with cancer patients   and their families and appreciate that they are seeking answers. However,  the science and the facts show that their illnesses were not caused by their  use of our talcum-based products. Please see factsabouttalc.com and  LTLManagementinformation.com for information on the safety of talc and steps  taken to equitably resolve all talc claims. &  remains steadfastly  confident in the safety of talc-based JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. We strive to ensure that all who use our products have unequivocal confidence  in their quality, safety and authenticity. We aggressively continue to manage  risks related to illicit trade to protect patients and consumers from potential  harm. When a counterfeit product is purchased, everyone—except for the  counterfeiter—loses. The consumer or patient does not get the product they paid  for and, more important, could be at risk of serious health problems—potentially  even death. Fake products undermine confidence in the quality, safety and  reliability of healthcare products which, at  & , are central to  everything we do. Counterfeiting may also fund other illegal activities such as  terrorism, organized crime, child labor, etc., with far-reaching adverse effects on  people, communities and healthcare systems. We believe the illicit trade of healthcare products must be eliminated for the  benefit of all, and we strongly support stricter regulation in this area. Similarly, we  supported the passage of the H.R. 5663 Safeguarding Therapeutics Act, giving  the FDA the authority to destroy counterfeit medical devices and combination  products at ports of entry. The bill came into force in January 2021. During 2021, we continued to reinforce our programs and  actions to help stamp out illicit trade in the following ways:  
Adopting new ways of monitoring and detecting illicit trade through enhanced  product security intelligence and analytics, addressing the growing sophistication  of illicit trade and the expansion of online marketplaces. Advanced technology is  a critical component of our protection against illicit trade. Our new mobile app  provides field-based product authentication capabilities to enhance product  security. We maintain round-the-clock monitoring of more than 1.6 million global  websites, more than 30 social media sites, almost 800 marketplaces and 60 dark  web locations. We also examine new data sources for shipments through customs  monitoring programs. Protecting our COVID-19 vaccine from illicit trade through best-in-class product  protection features. An example last year in Kenya saw individuals posing as  healthcare workers administering a fake version of our COVID-19 vaccine—one   of the many ways in which illegal activity that can cause serious harm to people  and communities is showing up. To protect our patients, our Global Brand Protection (GBP) team built advanced  overt and covert product security features into vaccine packaging and intensified  monitoring of internet marketplaces and the dark web for COVID-19 pandemic  product risks and threats, including drugs and COVID-19 vaccines from other  manufacturers. We also worked across our supply chain to uphold our high  Enterprise standards for security and IP protection. COVID-19 anti-counterfeit  training was delivered by our teams to customs and border protection authorities  in several countries alongside the provision of our proprietary mobile app to  enable rapid product authentication in the field. Enhancing our response protocol for addressing identified illicit trade incidents. Once a suspect product or shipment has been identified, a swift and thorough  response is essential. Depending upon the unique circumstances (e.g., safety  risk and jurisdiction), we may pursue civil enforcement actions in parallel with  criminal prosecution when illicit trade is uncovered. This parallel approach was  used, for example, to fight counterfeits of our branded surgical product used to  control bleeding in surgeries worldwide. We pursued civil litigation to have the  counterfeit products removed from circulation from the U.S. marketplace; criminal  prosecution efforts are still ongoing. Training employees and law enforcement:  Annually, all employees receive mandatory  training on identifying and reporting  Product Quality Complaint/Adverse Events,  which includes a module on illicit trade  complaints. Also mandatory for employees  is a biennial CBC training, which also  includes a module on counterfeit products  and illicit trade to help employees be  proactive in protecting our patients and  consumers. Outside the Company, we  regularly train members of law enforcement  to help them identify suspect versions of   &  products through our  GBP Customs Program for customs and  border protection officials. Maintaining our wide-ranging networks and partnerships for enhanced   product protection: promoting laws designed to render counterfeiting and   piracy unprofitable and undesirable is a common industry goal that drives  alliances between governmental and regulatory agencies and brand owners. At  & , our GBP team is a member of and holds leadership   roles in several illicit trade prevention consortiums. The team works with  government agencies around the world to encourage legislation that seeks   to dismantle illegitimate supply chains and punish those found guilty of illicit   trade. As many of our products are governed by Ministries of Health, we also   work with them to enact changes designed to better protect patient safety.  &  is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of those  who entrust us with their personal information. In addition to our Code of  Business Conduct and all the laws that apply to our operating companies’  handling of personal information, we maintain global privacy policies to  which all our businesses worldwide must adhere. Our policies reflect our  commitment to fair and transparent information practices. Similarly, through  our Information Security and Risk Management organization, we safeguard the  Company’s networks, systems, products and information against evolving cyber  threats to ensure the availability of critical systems and prevent unintended or  unauthorized access to both business and personal information. Proactive cyber protection for our COVID-19 vaccine information: The  intensive development processes and global scrutiny of all COVID-19  development, including our own work at  & , made  vaccine-related information a target for sophisticated attackers. We quickly  identified a clear need for additional vigilance and protection of critical data,  communications, applications, and systems supporting the development and  production of our COVID-19 vaccine. During 2021, we maintained increased  threat intelligence and proactive monitoring as well as protection of key  manufacturing sites, systems and processes to prevent disruption to vaccine- related activities from potential cyber threats. We also maintained heightened  privacy support and guidance for on-site COVID-19 testing, vaccine campaigns  and pandemic initiatives. Increased security capabilities at critical manufacturing sites and product  certifications: As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the resilience of our  supply chain in meeting the product needs of our patients and consumers  and reduce the risk of  &  being unable to manufacture or  ship critical products because of a cyber event, in 2021, we deployed new  cybersecurity capabilities at critical manufacturing and distribution sites and  enhanced third-party due diligence. Additionally, in 2021, we obtained ISO  27001 certifications for multiple products, including products from both the  MedTech and Pharmaceutical business segments. Maintaining global cybersecurity and privacy compliance: In 2021, we  continued our commitment to protecting our valued information resources,  such as IP and personal data, by expanding and automating our data protection  capabilities. With the ongoing growth and evolution of global privacy and  cybersecurity legal requirements designed to protect the rights of consumers,  patients, HCPs and employees, we expanded our efforts to develop enhanced  programs to ensure compliance with these new requirements while actively  engaging with policymakers to help address critical issues in the rapidly  changing privacy and data protection landscape. Our focus areas included   the newly established cybersecurity and data privacy laws in China, evolving  legal and regulatory laws in various U.S. states, South Korea, Thailand and  South Africa. At the core of our work lies digital security and  data—within  & , throughout  our value chain—and for all those who rely on us. We prioritize the sensitivity of the information we  handle and build frameworks that lock in patient  security and ensure the protection of personal  information entrusted to us. We share our learning  externally to improve industry practices and shape  regulatory protocols for the benefit of all. We also continued to work with our businesses to integrate privacy and  information security controls into designated data-driven initiatives (including data  science, clinical operations, digital surgery and robotics, and e-commerce) and  implement key standardized processes across  & , designed to  consistently support the rights of consumers and patients for the management of  their personal data. Maintaining awareness and vigilance among our employees: It is critical that  all employees at  &  maintain an always-on awareness of their  role in protecting information and data privacy and know what to do when faced  with potential threats and breaches. In addition to our annual mandatory training  on privacy and information security for employees (and contractors), regular  communications and reminders, we dedicate the months of January and October  each year respectively to privacy and cybersecurity awareness. In 2021, January  was dedicated to International Privacy Day communications, and October was  filled with activities to inform, engage and update employees on matters relating  to information security. detailing our performance against the following ESG  standards and frameworks: Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI) Content Index; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  Culture of Health for Business; Sustainability   Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index; Task  Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD); UNGC Communication on Progress (UNGC);  Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) Cumulative doses donated since the start of the initiative   through the WHO and private donations (billions) 2.0

Employee data may  not include full population from more recently acquired companies, and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and  subcontractors are also excluded. Fixed-term contracts make up less than 5% of total employees plus individuals on fixed-term contracts. &   is not currently able to disclose the number of individuals on fixed-term contracts in 2021. We are working to make this information available in future. 3 Professional positions are defined as pay grades 20-26. Management positions are defined as pay grade 30 and above; executives are defined as employees  reporting directly to the CEO. 4 Values have been rounded to the nearest tenth. Due to rounding, the numbers presented do not add up precisely to the totals provided, and percentages may  not precisely reflect the absolute figures. 7 LWDC rate, TRIR, SIIC rate, and fatalities are calculated for  &  employees and contingent workers. Contingent workers (i.e., workers sup- plied by third-party agencies that are the worker’s employer of record) are intended to supplement or temporarily replace existing workforce and are directly  supervised by a  &  employee. 9 CPMM and IPMM rates are based on Safe Fleet data. Rate calculation methodology uses both actual and estimated data on miles driven. We collect Safe  Fleet data on employees who drive Company-owned or -leased and personally owned vehicles for Company business. Employees in the latter category are  those who: 1) drive for Company business as a “regular part“ of their job duties, and 2) receive a car allowance to purchase their own vehicle and/or are reim- bursed for vehicle expenses such as fuel, maintenance, insurance and other miscellaneous charges associated with vehicle upkeep.

Energy intensity  ratio includes electricity, stationary fuels and district heating and cooling. 4 Values have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Due to rounding, the numbers presented do not add up precisely to the totals provided, and percentages may not  precisely reflect the absolute figures. 5 In accordance with guidance from World Resources Institute Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, we restated the 2019 and 2020 values to reflect newly released  electricity grid emission factors as well as the addition or removal of acquisitions and divestitures. This threshold for restatement deviates from the one included in the About  this Report section. We do not currently use purchases, sales or transfers of offsets in our GHG accounting. Gases covered in these calculations include CO2, CH4, N2O and  HFCs. Perfluorinated chemicals, sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride do not result from our operations. Biogenic CO2 emissions in 2021 were 1,758 MT CO2. Electricity  emission factors are obtained from the International Energy Agency’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion Report; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s eGRID  publication for location-based Scope 2 reporting, and supply contracts and residual emission factors, where available, for market-based Scope 2 reporting. Fuel emission  factors are obtained from the EPA Climate Leadership publication. Global Warming Potentials are obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth  Assessment Report. The chosen consolidation approach for emissions is operational control. 6 We did not report Scope 2 emissions using the market-based method prior to 2017. Starting from 2017, we have reported Scope 2 emissions using both location-based and  market-based methods, based on the latest Scope 2 guidance from the World Resources Institute in the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 7 2016-2020 data for certain Scope 3 upstream categories is restated to adjust for inflation. Emissions were calculated using Company spend in the reporting year paired with  appropriate economic input/output (IO) emission factors from the Carnegie Mellon 2002 data set. Where more specific primary data were able to be obtained, they were  used in place of the IO calculation methodology. 9 Data from a 2021 survey of a sample of employees in all regions, extrapolated for all employees globally, were used to estimate average employee commuting and remote  working emissions intensity per employee. This value was used to calculate 2021 emissions from Employee Commuting. 10 Emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities were calculated for emissions from transmission and distribution (T&D) losses from purchased electricity, well-to-tank  (WTT) emissions from purchased electricity, WTT emissions from T&D losses, and WTT emissions from purchased fuels. Emissions were calculated using IEA loss factors for  electricity and DEFRA WTT emission factors for fuels and electricity. 11 Emissions from Upstream Leased Assets were calculated by applying the energy intensity from office locations in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint to the building area   of leased assets less than 50,000 square feet, or those greater than 50,000 square feet outside of our operational control which are excluded from Scope 1 and Scope 2  reporting. 12 Emissions from Waste Generated in Operations were calculated for both non-hazardous and hazardous waste from manufacturing and R&D operations using DEFRA’s  emissions factors for waste. In years prior to 2020, only non-hazardous waste emissions were reported. 13 Emissions from Downstream Transportation and Distribution were calculated using the U.S. EPA’s SmartWay Program and are provided for U.S. shippers only. GHG covered  in these calculations include CO2 only for the 2020 calendar year, the most up-to-date available. 2021 data will be available in December of 2022 and will be reported in future  reports. We have identified a level of uncertainty around the reporting boundary, and the reported value is potentially overstated. 14 Emissions from the Use of Sold Products and the End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products were calculated using sales volumes for all  &  products   combined with lifecycle assessment (LCA) models where sales volumes could be obtained; where they could not be obtained, sales revenues and average unit prices were  used to estimate volumes. Due to the size of our product portfolio, LCAs were not performed for every  &  product, so products were placed into LCA   categories, and a representative product LCA was applied. It should be noted that due to the assumptions that were made,  &  did not receive third-party  limited assurance for these scopes but will work to improve these assumptions in the coming years. 15 Emissions from the Processing of Sold Products, Downstream Leased Assets, Franchises and Investments are not applicable to  &  operations. 18 Results from completed projects. Based on fuel and electricity reduction calculations. Avoidance of energy consumption and GHG emissions calculated by comparing  energy consumption before project implementation and expected consumption after implementation using engineering estimates at the time the projects are approved. 21 Certified to ISO 14001 or ISO 45001 means the site has received an external certification that is valid as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in sites with ISO 14001   certifications is driven in part by a decrease in overall  & -owned manufacturing and R&D sites. 22 The denominator of total manufacturing and R&D sites excludes small R&D and manufacturing sites (defined as having less than 50 employees) and newly acquired sites  (i.e., owned less than three years as of December 31, 2021). 23 Environmental non-compliances represent instances of non-compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or laws that were either (i) self-reported to authorities  in the reporting year or (ii) identified by authorities and the non-compliance occurred in the reporting year. The authorities include regional, national, state/country/province  and local/city regulatory agencies. 24 Environmental non-compliances and fines paid exclude newly acquired sites (i.e., owned less than two years as of December 31, 2021). 25 Fines paid for environmental non-compliances include those paid in the reporting year. It does not include fines assessed and/or under negotiation that were not paid as of  December 31, 2021.

Values have been rounded. Due to rounding, the numbers presented do not add up precisely to the totals provided, and percentages may not precisely  reflect the absolute figures. 2 Due to a categorization error, 2019 and 2020 figures are restated. Consumer MedTech supplier spend is included in the MedTech business segment. It had historically  been reported as part of the Consumer Health business segment. 3 Supplier EcoVadis assessments are reported as of January 31, 2022 may not capture suppliers that updated their assessment in January of 2022. 4 Total Global Impact Spend consists of: Tier 1 Diverse supplier spend in the U.S. (billions) and countries outside the U.S. (billions), plus Small business spend in the U.S.  (billions), less overlap spend, plus Tier 2 diverse supplier spend, global (millions). U.S. suppliers can be classified as Tier 1 Diverse and Small business. The Tier 1 & Small  overlap is removed to avoid double counting of the spend. 5 Except Tier 2 Diverse spend, all indicators represent spend  &  has control over/addressable spend, defined as products and services that procurement  teams can negotiate with suppliers to meet business goals. 6 A technical visit is a follow-up visit to the initial audit. 7 We define a critical finding as evidence of very high risk to human life or potential catastrophic impact to facility, community or environment. We expect suppliers and  potential suppliers to address critical findings immediately. 8 Social audits are conducted using the SMETA Protocol. The PSCI protocol was phased out in 2020. 9 Temporary workers supplied by third-party agencies that are the workers’ employer of record. Contingent workers are intended to supplement existing workforce or  temporarily replace them. 10 Certifiers include senior leaders at VP2 level and above, selected Managing Directors and General Managers based on country or business segment risk profile, and  executives of recently acquired companies. 11 OPDP: Office of Prescription Drug Promotion; and APLB: Advertising and Promotional Labeling Branch of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. 13  &  Triage Committee and case investigators have the ability to change the issue type of cases upon receipt in Our Credo Integrity Line. This occurs for  5% or fewer of cases. 14 The increase in percentage is not a reflection of new labor unions being recognized, but rather clarifying the definition of representation by labor union which expanded  the qualifying population of certain countries in Asia and Latin America. 15 Product recall rate is defined as the number of lots removed from market per total globally manufactured, based on field action removals where it has been determined  internally by a Quality Review Board, and aligned by  &  Enterprise Compliance, that there is a reasonable probability that the product may cause   temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences and, in certain cases, will cause serious adverse health consequences. 16 The Pharmaceutical and MedTech recall rates consider all products in each business segment. The Consumer Health product quality recall rate is inclusive of Consumer  Health products from the Self-Care over-the-counter (OTC) business segment. It does not represent Essential Health and Skin Health/Beauty business segment products,  including the voluntary recall of certain aerosol sunscreen products in 2021. 17 All employees at  &  are trained in the Code of Business Conduct as well as what to do if they become aware of a product complaint or adverse event.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) performed limited assurance on certain data  in the following categories (see PwC’s Report of Independent Accountants and  Management’s Assertion): 
Our Global Audit & Assurance organization reviewed select data for accuracy,  completeness and validity. The financial data and general information about   
Acquisitions: EH&S data of recently acquired companies, except for employee  road safety data and site ISO and OHSAS certification data, are included in the  Report two years after acquisition, unless otherwise noted. This grace period  allows the new acquisitions to adjust their EH&S management and reporting  systems to  &  standards. The dates and details of recent acquisitions can be found in Note 18 (Acquisitions  and Divestitures) on page 84 of our 2021 Annual Report. Divestitures: Except for injury statistics and violations or fines, EH&S data of  divested companies are excluded in the reporting year. Restatements: We use a 5% change threshold to apply to significant changes in  data or information that is restated, unless otherwise noted. There are a number of  potential reasons that may lead to a restatement of either prior periods or baseline  data (e.g., a significant change in newly published measures, new acquisitions or  divestitures, data errors, or improvements in data collection methodology over  time). Depending on circumstances, each is evaluated using this threshold, and  appropriate disclosures are included in the Report.

ERM CVS’ responsibility is to provide conclusions on the  agreed scope based on the assurance activities performed  and on exercising our professional judgement. Based on our assurance activities, as described below, nothing has come to  our attention to indicate that the progress against the Health for Humanity  2025 Goals, as reported in the Scorecard in the Reporting Hub section on  healthforhumanityreport.jnj.com, is not fairly presented, in all material respects, in  accordance with the reporting criteria. We planned and performed our work to obtain all the information and  explanations that we believe were necessary to provide a basis for our assurance  conclusions. A multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists  performed assurance procedures as follows: 
•  A review of the reporting principles, boundaries, definitions and internal  guidelines for each of the Health for Humanity 2025 Goals;  
•  Conference calls with  &  Enterprise ESG Program Office to  discuss, understand, and evaluate the systems and processes (including internal  review/audit) used for collecting, consolidating, evaluating and reporting the  information and data used to report progress against the Health for Humanity  2025 Goals; 
•  Conference calls with management representatives responsible for each of the  Health for Humanity 2025 Goals to review the implementation of the related  activities undertaken in 2021; 
•  A review of samples of underlying documentary evidence and data to support  the reported progress for each of the Health for Humanity 2025 Goals; 
•  A high-level review of the GHG and renewable energy data to confirm  consistency with the findings of our separate GHG and renewable energy  verification engagement including completeness and consistency over time and  the restatements of the baseline and prior year data; and 
•  A review of the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work on  
The reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties,  given the available methods for determining, calculating, or estimating the  underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance conclusions  in this context. In addition, the assured information should be read in conjunction  with the boundary and consolidation policies under ‘About this Report’ on page  97 of the Report. Regarding the formation on healthforhumanityreport.jnj.com,  we provide no assurance over any information other than as described in our  assurance scope above nor on changes to the content of the assured information  after the date of this assurance statement.

ERM Certification and Verification Services (‘ERM CVS’) was engaged by  &  to provide limited  assurance in relation to 2021 (year ending December 31st 2021) GHG emissions and selected environmental data  presented on pages 90-92 in the  &  2021 Health for Humanity Report (the Report) and on   https://healthforhumanityreport.jnj.com as set out below. Whether the corporate 2021* data for the following selected indicators are fairly presented, in all  material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria: 
    -    9:  Downstream transportation and distribution for U.S. operations (from the EPA SmartWay  program for the year ending 31st December 2020) 
The WBCSD/WRI GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004, as updated  January 2015) for the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. &  is responsible for preparing the data and for its correct presentation in the Report  to third parties, including disclosure of the reporting criteria and boundary. ERM CVS’ responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the assurance  activities performed and exercising our professional judgement Based on our activities, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the  following selected 2021* corporate metrics are not fairly presented, in all material  respects, with the reporting criteria. This conclusion is to be read in the context  of the remainder of this statement, in particular the information in the emphasis of  matter and inherent limitations paragraphs below. Without affecting our conclusion, which is not modified, we draw attention to  the explanatory notes provided by  &  relating to the data on  page 91 of the Report, in particular the limitations relating to the data for the  Scope 3 emissions category 9 on page 93 of the Report which should be read in  conjunction with the data. Additionally, without affecting our conclusion, which is not modified, we draw  attention to the explanatory notes provided by  &  relating to the  data on page 90 of the Report, in particular the limitations relating to potential  additional sources of GHG emissions on page 60 of the Report which should be  read in conjunction with the data. Our objective was to assess whether the assured emissions data are reported  in accordance with the principles of completeness, comparability (across the  organisation) and accuracy (including calculations, use of appropriate conversion  factors and consolidation). We planned and performed our work to obtain all the  information and explanations that we believe were necessary to provide a basis for  our assurance conclusions. We applied a 5% material error threshold. •  Virtual interviews with relevant corporate staff to understand internal reporting  guidance and processes, including the use of its GHG Management Plan,  internal spreadsheets, and its various internal data management and reporting  systems for each of the metrics in scope; 
•  Virtual site visits to eight sites (Bangkok, Thailand; Ciudad Juarez, Mexico;  Beerse, Belgium; Ft. Washington, U.S.; San Angelo, U.S., Cork, Ireland; South  Holland, The Netherlands; Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil (desk-based)) to review  local reporting processes and consistency of reported annual data with selected  underlying source data for each indicator. We interviewed relevant staff,  reviewed site data capture and reporting methods, checked calculations and  assessed the local internal quality and assurance processes; 
•  A review of estimates, extrapolations, and assumptions made in relation to the  data for relevant GHG Scope 3 emissions categories; and 
The reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given  the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying  information. It is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this  context. Our independent assurance statement provides no assurance on the  maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this,  and in particular whether any changes may have occurred to the information since  it was first published. Due to COVID travel restrictions, we planned our assurance engagement to  include virtual site visits. While we believe this approach does not affect our  limited assurance conclusion(s) above, we draw attention to the possibility that if  we had undertaken in person visits we may have identified errors and omissions in  the assured information that we did not discover through the alternative assurance  program. •  The accuracy of the water balance (water consumed minus water discharge)  could be improved though consistency of accounting for evaporative losses at  relevant manufacturing locations. ERM CVS is a member of the ERM Group. The work that ERM CVS conducts for clients is solely related to  independent assurance activities and auditor training. Our processes are designed and implemented to  ensure that the work we undertake with clients is free from bias and conflict of interest. ERM CVS staff  that have undertaken this engagement work have provided no consultancy related services to  &   in any respect. We have reviewed the accompanying  &  management assertion that the sustainability metrics  as of or for the year ended December 31, 2021 in management’s assertion are presented in accordance with the  assessment criteria set forth in management’s assertion. & ’s management is responsible for its  assertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring  and reporting on the sustainability metrics. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management’s  assertion based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements,  and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to  obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management’s assertion  in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and  are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of  assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an  examination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a reasonable basis for our conclusion. We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant  ethical requirements related to the engagement. Our firm applies the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly,  maintains a comprehensive system of quality control. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In performing our review, we performed  inquiries, performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations on a sample basis, read relevant policies  to understand terms related to relevant information about the sustainability metrics, reviewed supporting  documentation in regard to the completeness and accuracy of the data in the sustainability metrics on a sample  basis, and performed analytical procedures. The preparation of the sustainability metrics requires management to establish the criteria, make determinations  as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make assumptions that affect reported information. The  selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially  different amounts or metrics being reported. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to  & ’s  management assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. Management of  &  is responsible for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the sustainability  metrics included in the tables below as of or for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the reporting year) for global  operations, unless otherwise noted. The metrics have been rounded to the nearest whole number unless otherwise  indicated. Management asserts that the metrics reported in the tables below, which are also included in the Health for Humanity  Report as identified by the “‡“ symbol, are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set forth below. Management is responsible for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis  for measuring and reporting on the sustainability metrics. The preparation of the sustainability metrics requires  management to establish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and  make assumptions that affect reported information. The selection by management of different but acceptable  measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.

NVIDIA is guided by a set of principles that we’ve held close to heart since our first  days. Build a company that attracts the world’s best people in our field. Give them  a place to do their life’s work, where they can build a great life for their family. Do  the really hard things that no one has done – whose solutions will have a great  impact on society. Do things that we are uniquely able to do. These principles have guided us through our company’s history, but the great  battle with COVID—and ways we took it on—gives them deeper meaning. At the onset of the pandemic, we moved quickly to ensure our employees were  safe by closing our offices and retooling NVIDIA to be a global distributed  workforce. We made sure our families were secure by pulling raises in by six  months, and we committed to paying our hourly contract workers. Our people came together to help those in need around the world. Together,  employees and the company have contributed $17 million to support COVID-related  causes in more than 40 countries, most recently in India where a second wave is  underway as I write this. On the technology front, we have worked with scientists, researchers, doctors,  and hospitals around the world—hundreds of initiatives in all—to simulate the  virus, understand its mechanics, develop vaccines and treatments, automate  hospitals, and arm medical professionals with new tools to help them save lives. NVIDIA-powered computers, from small autonomous machines to the most  powerful supercomputer in the U.S., were called into service. NVIDIA AI software  was used to sequence the virus genome, design tests, predict patient oxygen  needs in the ICU, and even optimize and turbo-charge clinical trials when every  second counted. We must be better prepared for future viruses. NVIDIA technology is essential for  the scientific community to develop an end-to-end computational defense system,  one that can detect early, accelerate the development of a vaccine, contain the  spread of disease and continuously test and monitor. This will not be the last virus,  but we can make it the last pandemic. And even while this battle has waged on, we are reminded that climate change  continues its march. The stakes are nothing short of existential. We all must  act. Whether through the cloud or in their own data centers, companies are  consuming ever more compute power as they embrace technologies like AI. NVIDIA accelerated computing can meet these demands at lower energy  consumption than traditional methods. The most energy efficient system on the  TOP500 list of supercomputers is our own NVIDIA DGx SuperPOD. In all, 26 of the  30 world’s greenest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA. Our end-to-end AI supercomputing platform powered by NVIDIA Ampere  architecture A100 GPUs are up to 40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU  servers when running AI and high-performance computing workloads. An  A100-powered hyperscale data center takes up 1/50th, just 2 percent, the rack  space of the CPU-based systems that it replaces. If all CPU servers running AI and HPC transitioned to GPUs, the world would  save 11 terawatt hours of electricity per year—equivalent to taking two coal-fired  power plants offline or removing 1.7M cars from the road. We’re also committed to powering our own data center operations with more  renewable energy. In FY21, 17 of our locations were fully powered by renewable  energy. Our goal is to derive 65 percent of our global electricity use from sources  like solar by 2025. As we published last year’s report, millions around the world had taken to the  streets in peaceful protest to demand justice for Black and African Americans. It was a call to action for all of us. NVIDIA committed to purposefully and  systematically create opportunities for Black and African American employees  and increase their representation at every level of our company. I’m proud that we’ve tripled Black and African American employees in the past year. And we became a much more diverse company globally, welcoming over 2,000  Mellanox employees from Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We appointed  leaders focused on inclusion, and on recruiting and retaining diverse talent, as  well as on creating a more inclusive developer ecosystem. We still have a lot of  work to do, but I’m excited about our progress and where we’re headed. Through the decades, we have stayed close to our principles because we believe  in them. We know that they are the right things to do. But this year we were reminded  that these principles aren’t just about building a great company and leaving the  world in better shape than we found it. We learned that the company we’ve built,  all of us, have great power to improve lives, and that our work can and will be  called into service at any time to save them. It’s a great responsibility but one that brings us incredible joy. It drives us every  day to apply our talents, our inventions, and our generosity to the world’s most  exciting opportunities and toughest challenges. Our employees are what makes NVIDIA great, and when we put them and their  families first, our company and stakeholders prosper. We create technology  that benefits people all over the world, and we continually endeavor to make our  products more energy efficient to curb climate change. Corporate responsibility is critical to NVIDIA’s mission and is a key priority for our  board of directors and management as well as with every employee. We believe in transparency and strong engagement with all stakeholders. We set  our CSR goals and priorities every year based on feedback from stakeholders and  with the intention to be better than we need to be. This report serves to provide a  clear understanding of our priorities and our progress. When it became clear that COVID-19 was a global pandemic that threatened all  of us, we made it a priority to take care of our people first. We closed our offices  immediately, began working remotely, and focused on their safety and well  being. Only the employees essential to keeping our data centers running so the  rest of the company could work remotely were allowed on our campuses, and  they were admitted under strict safety protocols to keep them safe. We provided our employees with enhanced health coverage and mental health  support and moved up our yearly performance review to give our employees  raises sooner. We took steps to ensure our campus contractors and vendors  were compensated, and we repurposed our sites with cafeterias to provide  meals to local families in California and India. And NVIDIANs came together to help charities. Together with contributions  from the company, they donated more than $16 million to COVID-related efforts  all over the world. And when India was struck with a second wave of COVID  this spring, employees and the company immediately donated another $1  million to provide oxygen concentrators, ICU beds, and hygiene and food kits to  communities across the country. Our commitment to ensuring our people and their communities were taken  care of and productive while working from home has paid off. Over the year, our  product portfolio has grown as people adjusted to working, teaching, learning,  and playing from home. From gaming for entertainment to accelerated computing  inside data centers, our products and services have been in great demand. Last year NVIDIA’s CEO made a pretty definitive statement around needing to do  more to further racial justice. What has NVIDIA done in this area? When Jensen said it’s not enough to just not be a racist company—we all took it  to heart. We’re making assertive steps to create a more diverse workplace and a  company that will better serve humanity. Representation and inclusion start at the top. Twenty-three percent of our board  members are women and 38% are gender, racially, or ethnically diverse. Among  our employees, we’re increasing representation through a focused hiring effort,  and last year we connected with 47,000 underrepresented candidates through  virtual university and professional career events. We filled three leadership roles  key to creating an equitable company: heads of inclusion and belonging, ethical  AI, and diversity recruiting. We use this report to be transparent in reporting pay and workplace equality  data. We’re proud that this is our sixth year in achieving pay parity, and in the  last year we’ve tripled Black and African American employees in the U.S. We  recognize we still have a lot to do to improve representation across NVIDIA, but  we’re pleased with our progress to date. Our commitment to inclusion extends beyond our company to ensure our AI   developer ecosystem is more representative of the global population. In  partnership with several university and professional organizations, we increased  by 4-5x the number of women and Black and Latino developers at our most  recent developers conference. And to build a future pipeline of developer and  employee talent, we’re partnering with nonprofits to expand curriculum access to  AI for students in underrepresented communities. As we look ahead, we see our commitments and choices coming to fruition. We’ll  continue our focus on employees and their families as a top priority, and harness  their innovation to build products that make a lasting contribution to humanity. We’ll continue hiring and promoting diverse talent across the company, with a  focus on increasing diverse representation in leadership. And we’re undertaking  efforts to create a more inclusive environment, through career acceleration  initiatives and development of a manager playbook, while seeking guidance from  our numerous employee resource groups on what we can do to create a place  where all employees can do amazing work. Finally, we recognize the need of companies to act on climate change. We are  focusing on the carbon emissions footprint across our product lifecycle and  developing initiatives such as net-zero and science-based targets. We look  forward to sharing more in the coming months. We update our issue analysis each year to ensure that our priorities remain  aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and  opportunities. For FY22, we have reconfirmed the eight priority issues we  identified in FY21. These issues are essential to our continued business success  and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders: 
A strategic focus on these areas enables us to build a more agile, future-oriented  company. We implement several initiatives related to our priorities annually,  which provide varying levels of return according to the business goals assigned  to the topic. > Throughout the year, the CSR  Committee collects input from  internal and external stakeholders  regarding their priorities. Each  issue is assigned a quantitative  score based on this input. > Members of the Nominating and  Corporate Governance Committee  of our Board of Directors and  several executive staff members  review these issues. A third party  then individually ranks each issue  according to stakeholder input. Each issue is evaluated in the  context of our changing business,  and internal enterprise risk  discussions. > The CSR Committee positions  the issues on a matrix according  to stakeholder and executive  feedback, highlighting the most  important issues to external  stakeholders and executives.  > We changed the names of two issues to better reflect  both our management of them and stakeholder  expectations: Trustworthy AI (from Societal Impacts of  AI); Data Centers, Labs, and Office Management (from  Facilities Management);  
 > We consolidated three issues into the definitions of  other issues: Recycling/E-waste (into Waste), Supplier  Environmental Management (into Supply Chain  Management), and Transport and Logistics (into  Climate Change). > We determined the following issues decreased  in stakeholder priority: Community Engagement,  Customer Relations, Energy, Waste, Water,  Human Rights, Materials Sourcing, Public Policy  Engagement, and Product Safety. We address our priorities in subsequent sections of this report. We define each issue, discuss why it’s important to  NVIDIA and how we manage it, and disclose any relevant performance data. We dedicate ourselves to building  a just, decent, and inclusive  company. We believe it is not  enough to be a company that does  not oppress underrepresented  communities. We must be  empathetic to their experience  and act to make NVIDIA a place  of opportunities—a place they  can do their life’s work. We do  this because it is right and just,  and because we believe it will  help make NVIDIA better.” Engaging our diverse stakeholders on important issues is integral to how we do business. We define stakeholders  as entities or individuals who can be affected by NVIDIA and whose actions can affect the company. We rely on our  annual priority issue assessment to help us understand the issues that matter most to them, which allows us to  focus our engagement and transparently respond to their concerns. Members of the CSR Committee are assigned  based on subject-matter expertise to evaluate each stakeholder request to determine what type of response is  appropriate. The issue most commonly raised across multiple stakeholders last year was racial and social justice. In June 2020,  our CEO Jensen Huang addressed the racial inequities present in the United States and committed to elevate the  urgency of increasing the Black population at every level of our company. Throughout the latter half of FY21, we  received stakeholder requests to disclose our EEO data and commitments to diversity and inclusion within our  workforce. Learn more about our efforts to build a more inclusive company in the Talent Strategy, Diversity and  Inclusion section. > Collect feedback related to CSR issues that impact the company as part of  our annual priority issues analysis; and 
In early FY22, we briefed the committee on our climate change position and  informed them of increased investor interest in net zero strategies. Communities We supported more than 5,000 nonprofits in 50 countries around the world. Our philanthropic giving exceeded $25 million, with more than $16 million  directed to COVID-19 related causes. To support youth from underserved communities in developing STEM  skills, we provided funding to and held virtual volunteer events for nine  organizations working toward this goal. View the top 20 organizations we gave to in our Community Engagement  section. See the NVIDIA Foundation annual report for FY21 activities in   our communities. Customers/Developers We provided customers with completed self-assessment questionnaires  and participated in relevant working groups through our “Full” category  membership in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). We hosted developer conferences in the United States and China, with 151,000  total registrations. We offered admission and training at these conferences  for women and members of the Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino  communities to increase participation by developers from underrepresented  communities in technology. We sent several communications related to COVID-19 around employee safety,  working from home, and mental health, and built a website with information  to help employees navigate work during the pandemic. We moved to a pulse survey format, delivering four focused surveys on topics  such as COVID-19 support, team building, and CSR, with an average positive  sentiment of 88 (out of 100 possible points) across all surveys. We partnered with our Black NVIDIAN Network resource group to increase  our hiring of Black/African American employees. We continued our engagements with the United States House and Senate AI  Caucus, the Congressional Tech Staff Association, and key officials in the  legislative and executive branches. We hosted a Public Sector Summit at our virtual GPU Technology Conference  in October featuring representatives from several federal agencies and  Congress. Among the 100 summit sessions, we featured a panel with the  chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on the promise  of 5G powered by AI, as well as one focused on standards, investments, and  regulatory actions around a national strategy on AI. We partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop AI models to  help researchers study COVID-19 in chest CT scans in an effort to develop  new tools to better understand, measure, and detect infections. We supported an employee who served as co-chair of Computing Technology  Industry Association’s workforce subcommittee, where we supported policy  development around skills-based training, apprenticeships, certifications,  and workforce model development. We participated in the development and advocacy of the Semiconductor  Industry Association’s policy plan, which recommended substantial investment  in the U.S. workforce and federal R&D programs. We engaged with the Consumer Technology Association and Information  Technology and Innovation Foundation on AI policy development. Nongovernmental Organizations We scored 100% on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index  for a sixth consecutive year. We engaged with As You Sow, Investor Alliance for Human Rights, know the  Chain, World Benchmarking Alliance, and the World Economic Forum 2030  Vision Government Framework. Research/Ratings Organizations We remain on the following rankings/indexes: 3BL Media’s 100 Best Corporate  Citizens, Barron’s Top 100 Most Sustainable Companies, Bloomberg Gender  Equality Index, Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Forbes’ Best Employers for  Diversity, Forbes’ JUST 100 Companies, FTSE4Good, and Newsweek’s Most  Responsible Companies. We were featured for the fifth year on Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work  For at No. 12 and Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work at No. 2. We were recognized in Corporate knights’ 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable  Corporations and Wall Street Journal’s Most Sustainably Managed  Companies in 2021. Shareholders We participated in CDP for the 12th year and achieved an A- on our climate  change and water security responses. We presented CSR issues to stockholders holding 32% in aggregate of our  common stock during the company’s annual outreach meetings. Topics  covered included: human capital management during COVID-19, climate  change, diversity and inclusion at the company and board level, and board  involvement in CSR. We scored No. 1 in several categories of Institutional Investor’s 2021   All-American Executive Team Leaders survey, including top executives, top  IR and ESG teams, and best communications response to COVID-19. We  were No. 1 on Investor’s Business Daily’s Best ESG Companies List. See Supply Chain Management to see the full range of activities we  conducted, including 100% completion of risk assessment and self-assessment  for all applicable suppliers, receipt of 10 Validated Assessment Program  audits from high-spend suppliers, and reviewing audits of 55% of our  strategic suppliers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed our nearly 60 offices around  the world in March 2020 for all except essential workers. For essential labs and  offices that remain open, we instituted frequent disinfection, temperature taking,  and social distancing guidelines. We provided our employees with enhanced  health coverage and reimbursement for certain work from home expenses,  moved up our yearly performance review to put raises in the hands of employees  sooner, and continue to support them in making their health, and their families’  health, a top priority. Additionally, our HR and IT teams assembled several  resources for employees: 
A comprehensive website with information on work  guidelines, IT help, benefits, and how to engage in the  company’s charitable mission to support local charities,  neighbors, and small businesses; 
A collection of resources and weekly webinars for  employees and managers adjusting to working and  leading remotely;  
To give employees time to recharge after a demanding year, we had a company  wide shut down for one week during the winter holidays. In our supply chain, we focus on protecting worker rights while promoting business  continuity. NVIDIA is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and  we follow their process to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on our  supply chain. We partnered with a customer to survey several select suppliers to  understand the impact on workers’ hours and wages. As a result of the workplace disruption, we have seen an increase in working hours  this year and are supporting our suppliers through this process. The RBA and  NVIDIA allow for certain exemptions to working hours requirements in the case of  emergency or other unusual situations, and we have identified the virus outbreak,  and subsequent government shutdown of activities across the globe, as such. Strategic suppliers have communicated any reporting or auditing delays, including  Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audits and International Organization for  Standardization renewal audits. We continue to work with them and are applying  guidance in accordance with the RBA, while remaining in conformance with its code  of conduct. The RBA has also launched a Remote VAP audit option for qualifying  facilities, and we will utilize that where possible to keep our suppliers on their  normal audit cycle. We have worked to fight COVID-19 with researchers, scientists, healthcare, and  governments worldwide. Many AI startups in our NVIDIA Inception accelerator  program have done innovative work in this area, including DarwinAI, which  developed an AI model to detect COVID-19 in CT scans with 96% accuracy;  Kinetica, which converted case location data into usable intelligence for faster  decision-making; and Ouva, which created a touch-free hospital intelligence  platform for monitoring patient safety. NVIDIA technology is also being used for  contactless temperature screening applications and spotlighting potentially  contaminated surfaces. A team of 27 researchers led by Rommie Amaro at the University of California  at San Diego won the Gordon Bell Prize for COVID-19 by using NVIDIA GPUs to  create the largest, longest, and most accurate simulation of a coronavirus to  date. The AI-assisted simulation took a few months, compared to five years for  developing the simulation for the flu virus. Despite being physically distanced due to office closures, NVIDIANs around the  world united in response to the pandemic. Together, employees and the company  donated more than $16 million to support COVID-19-related efforts to date,  reaching nonprofits in more than 40 countries. More than 3,500 NVIDIANs participated in a companywide challenge, Coming  Together Against Coronavirus, which encouraged small actions to protect  themselves and their communities, while containing the spread of the disease. Together, employees completed more than 23,000 simple activities, like purchasing  gift cards from small businesses, thanking frontline healthcare workers,  supporting local restaurants, and staying connected—and, as a result, unlocked a  $250,000 donation to the World Health Organization. Our food service staff kept our kitchen facilities open to provide regular meals to  3,800 families through a Silicon Valley nonprofit during FY21, and, in early FY22,  expanded this program to our India sites. We are taking a cautious approach to reopening, putting the health and safety of  our employees and their families first. Plans to reopen our offices are being made  on a site-by-site basis. By early FY22, only a few of our offices have reopened, and  those in other parts of the world are yet to be determined. We continue to work closely with our supply chain, developer, and community  partners to support them through this time. Information about our efforts can be  found on our webpage. NVIDIA, including its Board of Directors, is committed to operating under sound  principles of corporate governance. Our corporate governance structure ensures  robust Board and management accountability and transparency to our stockholders  and promotes good decision-making now and in the future. To ensure that long-term interests are being served, our Board oversees  management performance. Our overarching code of conduct, financial team code of  conduct, corporate governance policies, Board committee charters, certificate of  incorporation, and bylaws form the framework for governance at NVIDIA. As of the end of FY21, we had 13 directors on our Board, 12 of whom (92%) were  independent. The sole exception is Jensen Huang, who is also our founder, president,  and chief executive officer. Our corporate governance policies permit the Board to  designate either a chairperson of the Board or a lead independent director, which  gives the Board flexibility in determining what is best for the company. Consistent  with our non-hierarchical culture, NVIDIA’s Board has a lead director, Mark Perry,  rather than a chairperson. In FY21, all directors attended at least 75% of meetings  of the Board and committees on which they served. Non-employee director compensation is reviewed by the Board’s Compensation  Committee in consultation with a compensation consultant after an evaluation  of peer group practices, and is ultimately approved by our Board. We design our  named executive officer (NEO) compensation program to pay for performance and to  attract and retain a high-caliber executive team. NEO pay is heavily weighted toward  performance-based variable cash and long-term equity awards that are earned  only if we achieve pre-established corporate financial metrics. Our compensation  program requires executives to maintain meaningful stock ownership, and a  clawback policy is in place for performance-based compensation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) of our Board is   responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices  concerning environmental, social, and corporate governance. Our head of CSR  reviews stakeholder inputs with and collects feedback on priorities from the  NCGC each year. The priorities include issues that are of utmost importance to our  stakeholders, such as climate change, human rights, and diversity and inclusion. Starting in FY22, NVIDIA management will periodically report to the NCGC about  the company’s policies and practices regarding governmental relations, public  policy, and related expenditures. We strive to achieve the highest standards of ethical conduct in all our business  dealings. Our codes of conduct and policies guide how we conduct ourselves in our  professional relationships toward our customers, partners, competitors, vendors,  government regulators, shareholders, fellow employees, and the community at  large. Our longstanding code of conduct outlines our core values and establishes  our expectations about the way we conduct business. This code applies to all our  executive officers, directors, and employees, and we expect all third parties we  do business with, including consultants, contractors, and other service providers,  to act in a manner consistent with it. In addition, we have established a financial  code of conduct that applies to our executive staff, directors, and members of our  finance, accounting, tax, and treasury departments. Our commitment to promoting a culture of integrity means that we aim to foster  an environment where everyone is expected to act ethically and feel empowered  to voice concerns without fear of retaliation. Any employee can confidentially and  anonymously lodge a complaint about any accounting, internal control, auditing,  code of conduct, conflict of interest, or other matters of concern using a corporate  hotline, which is hosted by an independent third party. By using an external  organization to host the hotline, we ensure that our employees feel secure their  reports will be anonymous. We have a strict “no retaliation” policy regarding good  faith reports of activities that run counter to our ethical expectations. In FY21, we  expanded the availability of the hotline to supply chain workers and attendees of  our annual developers conference. All NVIDIA employees receive ethics and sexual harassment training. Upon hire  and then every two years thereafter they also complete training in our code of  conduct, which covers environmental and social responsibility issues. As of March  2021, nearly 100% of employees had completed this training. Our longstanding commitment to doing business with integrity and ethics, and  to preserving our ability to work with customers and governments, means  avoiding all forms of corruption. Our anti-corruption practices specifically  emphasize making ethical decisions, never engaging in bribery or insider trading,  avoiding conflicts of interest, approaching competition ethically, complying  with international trade regulations, promoting transparency, and maintaining  accurate business records. To protect our company’s reputation, we have several  policies related to these issues, and we expect employees to comply with them. Nearly 100% of employees who have frequent contact with customers, partners,  and suppliers (such as those in sales, finance, and procurement) have completed  additional global anti-bribery and anti-corruption training. Innovation is at our core. Our invention of the GPU defined modern computer  graphics and established us as the leader in visual computing. With our subsequent  introduction of the CUDA programming model, we opened the parallel processing  capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. We have since extended  our research and development emphasis to the revolutionary field of AI. About 24% of our revenue in FY21 ($3.92 billion) funded R&D activities. In total, we  have invested more than $24 billion in these efforts since our inception, yielding  inventions that are essential to modern computing. NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, software,  algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create unique value for the  markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse,  we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs  and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to  support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying  technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or  by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number of  developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the  value of our platform to our customers. Our two reportable segments—Graphics and Compute & Networking—are based  on a single underlying graphics architecture. We specialize in markets in which  GPU-based visual computing and accelerated computing platforms can provide  tremendous throughput for applications. Our platforms address four large  markets where our expertise is critical: gaming, professional visualization, data  center, and automotive. In 2020, NVIDIA had a series of  breakthroughs that significantly  reduced the amount of data needed  in “generative adversarial networks,”  a deep-learning method of creating  images, sounds and videos that did  not exist before. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular  innovations and technologies, based on such factors as: 
 > The degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully  enforced in different jurisdictions; and 
We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to  enter into such license agreements. NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, software,  algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create unique value for the markets  we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address  them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software  stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support  several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by  using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party  developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across  our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our  platform to our customers. The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by  rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the  principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product  offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software  support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities,  processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain  competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and  functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to  deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and  at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing  competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced  than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided  by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances  among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. NVIDIA was featured in Fortune’s  Change the World list, which  recognizes companies leveraging  their core business strategy to have a  positive impact on humanity. NVIDIA  GPUs enable scientists to use images  like the one above to virtually screen  more than a billion drug-candidate  compounds and molecules in 24  hours—a process that would take five  to 10 years of “wet lab” work. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and  to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services, and technologies  that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require  considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business  offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the  automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our  business. We also must continue to scale our networking business following the  Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product capabilities and continuing  to effectively integrate company processes. We must also continue to develop the  infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer  service and support, e-commerce and intellectual property licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve our business, including by developing market  specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our  products and technologies, expanding the ecosystem for our current and future  products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our business in various  areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are  subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in  research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several  years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new  products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not  become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of  operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure that our strategic direction will result in innovative products  and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and, ultimately,  our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets  and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy  as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market  opportunities, our business will be harmed. Our information security practices include the measures we design to protect  networks, computers, programs, and data, as well as NVIDIA’s products and the  privacy of our customers’ and employees’ data, from unauthorized access or  attack. As we become aware of more frequent high-profile security breaches in  business and government, and as new dangers arise, we remain committed to  implementing appropriate protections for any personal information we collect or  that our users share with us. Our efforts are managed by a global team of cybersecurity, IT, engineering,  operations, and legal experts. A cybersecurity committee, which meets monthly  and is driven by executive-level leaders, reviews metrics, and evaluates  emerging threats. To ensure a robust breadth of knowledge, the team consults  with external parties, such as computer security firms and those with risk  management and governance expertise. We address cybersecurity scenarios in our resilience planning, document them  through business continuity plans, and test the reliability of our products and our  ability to respond to threats through attack simulations. We follow the processes  outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 for Information Security Standards. Against the backdrop of frequent changes and fresh knowledge, we continually  evaluate and evolve our security measures. In the event of a cybersecurity  issue, we’ve prescribed a set of actions for teams to initiate that will help us to  determine the type and rigorousness of our response. The cybersecurity committee presents an annual update and provides education  to NVIDIA’s Board of Directors throughout the year. The team updates the Audit  Committee upon request. We continuously hone our cybersecurity and data privacy trainings and policies to  respond to new requirements in global privacy laws. Our relationship with our  colleagues, customers, and business partners is based upon mutual trust. We are  committed to maintaining this trust by protecting the information we hold from  inappropriate use, unauthorized access, loss, and accidental destruction. Information security/cybersecurity awareness training is available on demand to  all employees, and we hold regular live trainings. Our IT team has implemented  extensive training internally on the risks of phishing scam emails. This includes  sending simulated “attack” emails to all employees to test their awareness. The  team provides further awareness training to departments that have the most  inadequate response to the simulation exercise. NVIDIA takes security concerns seriously and works to evaluate and address them  quickly. When a security concern is reported, NVIDIA commits the appropriate  resources to analyze, validate, and provide corrective actions to address the issue. NVIDIA Security Bulletins and Notices are published on our website. Our processes are aligning with  ISO 27001. We completed a gap  assessment and expect to be certified  in 2022. The NVIDIA Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) goal is to minimize  customers’ risk associated with security vulnerabilities by providing timely  information, guidance, and remediation of vulnerabilities in our products and  services. NVIDIA PSIRT is a global team that manages the receipt, investigation,  internal coordination, remediation, and disclosure of security vulnerability  information related to NVIDIA products and services. We participate in the global  Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST.org), actively contribute  to FIRST.org Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to make improvements to PSIRT  processes, and share process knowledge with others so they may implement this  type of notification  and security work within their own organizations. NVIDIA’s Shawn Richardson sits on the Board of Directors for FIRST.org for the  2020-2022 term. Her oversight responsibilities include diversity and inclusion  initiatives and Liaison for SIGs to collaborate, share ideas, and occasionally produce  training, standards, frameworks, and documentation. We also participate in MITRE’s Cybersecurity and Vulnerability Exposure Number   Authority Coordination Working Group. In FY21, we partnered with third-party   research institutions and corporate peers to extend the MITRE ATT&Ck  framework for AI to advance the industry’s security and its response to new and  upcoming threats. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by  third parties located outside of the United States. Revenue from sales outside of  the United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for FY21, 92% for FY20 and  87% for FY19. As of January 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees were  located outside of the United States. Additionally, our worldwide business  activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United Sates  as well as of foreign governments. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties,  which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,  and results of operations, including international economic and political conditions  and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;  unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;  and exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions,  including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers  and restrictions. NVIDIA’s Global Trade Compliance Team helps ensure that applicable international   trade laws are followed when NVIDIA’s products are moved or sold internationally. With local presence in the U.S., APAC and EMEA, team members serve as subject  matter experts on the range of global trade issues that impact our business. The  team helps clear NVIDIA’s international shipments, performs restricted party  screening, advises on export license restrictions, sets policies and procedures,  and obtains import or export licenses when required. They also stay current on  new trade regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate and ensures NVIDIA  has processes in place to comply with the new regulations. Business continuity management (BCM) focuses on protecting our core values. Our philosophy of BCM is to identify realistic threats and their potential impact  to our core values and business operations and to design a formal framework  for responding. We believe that resilience can be achieved by embedding redundancy and diversity  into our response framework. A BCM steering committee of four executives is  supported by several business leaders across the following functions: Corporate  Communications, Cybersecurity, Facilities, Finance, Global Security, Human  Resources, Information Technology, and Operations. Each function has a plan to  identify and address potential risks. These efforts are supported by robust infrastructure, systems, policies, and  procedures and are designed to mitigate risk and protect the safety and trust of  our employees and customers when unexpected events such as a cyberattack,  business disruption, or natural disaster occur. In response to COVID-19, we closed our worldwide offices in March 2020 to  protect our employees and prevent further spread. With access to our sites  restricted to essential workers, we implemented numerous safety protocols and  provided resources for employees to work remotely. We continue to prioritize the  health and safety of our employees through a variety of efforts, detailed in  COVID-19 Response and Employee Health and Safety. BCM is critical to minimizing financial and reputational impacts. By anticipating  the likelihood of severe events, we can mitigate these risks and ensure that the  company does not endure unnecessary damages. Recognizing the implications of climate change for our business and the increased  relevance of climate risk to our investors, we conducted an initial climate risk  scenario analysis in FY21 to consider how resilient our business strategy is in the  face of increasing temperatures. Working with a consulting partner, we assembled a cross-functional stakeholder  group to oversee our scenario analysis. We identified our global data center  and lab locations to be of significant strategic relevance for our business and  modeled the potential outcomes under two warming scenarios, Representative  Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. We found that under a lower 2°C  warming scenario (RCP 4.5), the extent to which comfort cooling will be needed in  our current data centers and labs is projected to be 60% higher by 2030 and 100%  higher by 2050, relative to the 20-year baseline from 1986-2005. Increases in  comfort cooling needs are substantially higher under the RCP 8.5 scenario. While this could result in some increases in energy use to adequately cool our  facilities, for data centers in particular, various factors mitigate the potential risk  of system or server failure for NVIDIA. These factors include the efforts of our  teams to consider projected future climatic conditions as they specify new data  centers, the relatively broad temperature ranges our data center infrastructure  can handle, and the redundancy built into modern data center cooling systems. This is informative for the design, planning, and operation of our workplaces for  future employee comfort, and it signals potential increases in cooling-related  energy consumption and cost. We are considering the results of this scenario analysis in our strategic planning  decisions to mitigate the operational and capital cost risks of a warmer climate. See Environmental section of this report for more actions we are taking against  climate change. Public policy engagement enables us to affect government action and provide  thought leadership to global governments on issues that directly affect our  business. It’s also a platform for educating policymakers through demonstrations  of our technology, amplifying our work in targeted areas, and collaborating with  various organizations on issues of shared interest. We focus our public policy  activities in AI specifically to support governmental efforts to increase investment  in core AI research and support workforce development around AI by providing  educational resources to officials and their advisors. We don’t make contributions of any kind, such as money, employee time, goods  or services, or employee expense reimbursements to political parties or  candidates. This includes contributions through intermediary organizations, such  as political action committees or lobbyists, campaign funds, or trade or industry  associations. We don’t have a political action committee and don’t engage in  independent expenditures or electioneering communications as defined by law. We engage in lobbying for issues of importance to our business, customers,  stockholders, and employees through specifically authorized and legally  compliant lobbying activities. All lobbying activities require the prior approval of  NVIDIA Government Relations and Legal. Where required by law, we file lobbying  disclosure reports. In FY21, we did not perform lobbying activities or expend  resources that required registration under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. More  information about our political contributions and expenditures can be found on  our website. In FY21, we participated in the development and advocacy of the Semiconductor  Industry Association’s policy plan, which recommended substantial investment in  the U.S. workforce and federal R&D programs. As part of GTC, we brought together a leading group of policymakers and analysts  to discuss the United States’ national strategy regarding AI, with a specific focus  on standards, investments, and potential regulatory actions. Leaders from dozens of organizations, including the U.S. Department of Defense,  the Federal Communication Commission, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin,  NASA, RAND Corporation, Carnegie Mellon and Stanford Universities, participated  in approximately 100 sessions that were part of GTC’s Public Sector Summit, held  virtually in October 2020. In FY21, we served as the co-chair of Computing Technology Industry  Association’s workforce subcommittee, where we support policy development  around skills-based training, apprenticeships, and certifications. As part of these  efforts, we promoted a workforce development model that can be applied broadly  to benefit citizens of any state or community. To benefit the policy-making  process, we share our experiences with our Deep Learning Institute and the  partnerships we’ve formed with NGOs and universities nationwide. We provide subject-matter experts to educate government officials and their  policy advisors on AI technology, and offer insights into AI research and  development. We enhance our public policy reach through participation in groups   such as the Consumer Technology Association, Entertainment Software  Association, and the Semiconductor Industry Association, among others. Over the past year, we demonstrated to policy experts how AI capabilities can  contribute to better responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, we joined  the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, a collaboration with  the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the U.S. Department of  Energy, several technology companies, and national labs. The effort has driven  progress in understanding COVID-19 and creating treatments and vaccines. Researchers at NVIDIA also partnered with the National Institutes of Health to  develop AI models to help researchers study COVID-19 in chest CT scans in an  effort to develop new tools to better understand, measure, and detect infections. A bipartisan panel of key members of  Congress on AI joined Axios reporter  Erica Pandey for our AI for America  panel to explore their strategies. Representatives Robin kelly of  Illinois, Will Hurd of Texas, and Jerry  McNerney of California discussed  the immense opportunities of AI,  as well as challenges they see as  policymakers. Our customers include both businesses and individual consumers. We view our   commitment to positive customer relations in terms of the role we play as a   responsible supplier, our commitment to our reseller partners and their  customers, and to our direct customers. We support customers through a comprehensive support site and several  NVIDIA-hosted product forums and communities. Our customer service team   tracks interactions with consumers as they occur and shares bi-weekly satisfaction  reports internally. We measure customer satisfaction in several ways, including  customer satisfaction rate, percentage of support incidents filed, closed incident  survey response rate, and referral rate. We use these metrics to help promote  experiences that satisfy and delight our customers. Our support organization has taken steps to dramatically reduce the time it takes  for our software team to incorporate customer feedback, enabling technicians to  respond quickly and increase customer satisfaction. We also use data gathered  from our customer forums to give our research and development organizations  feedback about what’s working and what improvements our customers want. NVIDIA protects customer data and honors their choices in compliance with GDPR. More information can be found here about our privacy policy. We support developers who want to create innovative applications with our  products. We give developers diverse resources, including courses in parallel  programming; enhancement tools for debugging, performance, and testing;  access to highly skilled engineers and specialists who provide custom services  and co-design industry-specific applications; and financial support to university  researchers in various scientific disciplines. Our GPU Technology Conference  advances global awareness of accelerated computing, computer graphics, high  performance computing, AI, and deep learning. Our customers include some of the world’s largest electronics, consumer brand,  and automotive companies. Consequently, we’ve integrated the standards  outlined in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct covering  labor, environment, health and safety, ethics, and management systems  throughout our global operations. We use these standards as our management  approach for our supply chain. Our customer support organization is on the front line of communications with  our national and international partners, working with their engineering teams as  they test NVIDIA products in their systems and devices. Inquiries from our  original equipment manufacturer partners have increased in line with our focus on  supplier responsibility and environmental sustainability. Requests for information  have predominantly related to conflict minerals, environmental compliance,  quality, cybersecurity, consumer satisfaction, and ethics. GTC is a global conference series  providing training, insights, and direct  access to experts on the hottest  topics in computing today. Thousands  of researchers and professionals  attend to learn the latest on the  most dynamic topics related to high  performance computing, AI, and  deep learning. To manage these inquiries and requests, we employ quarterly business reviews  with key customers, and partner with them on various initiatives through the  RBA. Some customers assign points on their scorecards to environmental, social,  and governance performance. Customers who are RBA members monitor our  performance through tools provided by that organization, such as self-assessment  questionnaires, Validated Assessment Program, and tracking tools for carbon,  water, and waste. We also participate in the RBA environmental sustainability  workgroup and complete the online environmental survey on carbon, water,  and waste. In addition to the RBA Environmental Survey, we participate in the CDP climate  change and water surveys each year. Participants are scored based on their  understanding and management of their business risks, opportunities, and  impacts related to climate change and water resources. In 2020 we scored an  A- on both surveys. See our 2020 CDP response. We maintain Full Material Disclosures (FMD) for our chip designs but not all  system products. NVIDIA is required to report on material information through  various platforms, including Substances of Concern in Products and International  Material Data System for automotive. We have done the preliminary work to  expand our FMD program to all products and aim to implement it in FY22. The EPEAT program independently verifies the environmental impact of electronic  products and is used by thousands of private and public institutional purchasers  around the world to make sustainable IT procurement decisions. All NVIDIA GPUs  support EPEAT conformance, and we provide information to customers seeking to  register their products with the program. For partners that embed our  hardware in their products, quality  is monitored through ISO 9001  certification. Read more in Product  Quality. We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards of behavior. We  engage suppliers that share our values and closely manage our supply chain  to deliver innovative products that satisfy our customers’ expectations in a  socially and environmentally conscious manner. In our supply chain, we focus on  protecting worker rights while promoting business continuity. Read more about  the pandemic and our suppliers in Our Response to COVID-19. We have been Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) members since 2007 and  in 2018 were accepted as Full Member. From the beginning, we adopted the  RBA Code of Conduct and integrated its elements into our processes, including  auditing strategic suppliers and conducting internal assessments to confirm that  we are addressing all aspects of responsible supply chain management. We do not directly manufacture the semiconductor wafers or printed circuit boards  used in our products, nor do we manufacture our branded devices. Instead, we  partner with world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process,  including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We also contract  with manufacturers to build, test, and distribute our branded devices. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung  manufacture our semiconductor wafers. Our two main contract manufacturers  for company- or partner-branded devices are Foxconn and BYD. Foxconn,  Samsung, and TSMC are all RBA members. All our suppliers are required to comply with NVIDIA’s code of conduct, our CSR  Directive, and our policies related to human rights. They’re required to sign an  “Agreement for Manufacturer Environmental Compliance,” which includes all  relevant product regulatory compliance standards, social compliance standards,  chemical management, and the RBA Code. We also encourage them to use the  RBA Code as a platform to go above and beyond compliance. Our assessment process involves using the RBA online system to evaluate  existing and potential new suppliers against product compliance industry  standards, social and environmental criteria, conflict minerals, the RBA Code,  and NVIDIA’s code of conduct. Strategic suppliers include those who produce or handle NVIDIA production  material, those for whom we closely manage quality requirements (non-critical  suppliers), those who design our branded products, and those we are required to  work with based on customer agreements. For strategic suppliers, agreements are deployed and tracked through a  quarterly business review (QBR) process to make certain that they uphold our  requirements. Business allocation decisions are influenced by QBR performance. Each quarter, overall supplier assessment is reviewed by product category and  performance is ranked. Five of 100 QBR points are allocated to CSR issues, and  requirements vary by quarter. In FY20, we reviewed all strategic suppliers against NVIDIA cybersecurity  requirements, and in FY21, we performed a more in-depth assessment of higher  risk suppliers. We looked at our supplier’s conformance to ISO 27001, ISO 28001,  and C-TPAT standards, and evaluated them for additional information, product,  and physical security requirements. Depending on the results of the assessment,  we required suppliers to provide additional evidence of conformance or, if gaps  were discovered, to implement an improvement plan. Moving forward, we plan to  perform periodic assessments and continuous monitoring. Emissions are created at every stage of our product lifecycle, extending to our  customers’ use and disposal of our products. Since 2014, we have required our  key manufacturing suppliers to report their energy usage, greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions data, and reduction goals and objectives. We also require these suppliers to have their GHG emissions verified by a third  party. We use this supplier data to better understand the GHG emissions footprint  of our product manufacturing and to calculate the allocation of carbon emissions  from tier 1 suppliers that are attributable to our customers. We track suppliers’  annual GHG and carbon emissions through the CDP and RBA Environmental  Survey. We calculate carbon, water, and waste data for all silicon manufacturers  and systems contract manufacturers to determine carbon emissions and water  consumption per product and per financial outlay. In FY21, we surveyed our suppliers to better understand the renewable energy  performance and capability of our manufacturing supply chain. NVIDIA’s SAQ review determined that there were no  suppliers rated as high risk in our top spending area. We require VAP audits to validate supplier SAQs. This  process revealed one strategic supplier as high risk. We work with high- and moderate-risk suppliers to  review their CAPs and complete a Closure Audit when  necessary. We reviewed VAP audits in FY21 on 55% of our strategic  suppliers, bringing total audits in the past two years to  95%. We engaged 13 suppliers on their CAPs from the FY21  auditing season. Common findings include issues  related to occupational safety, emergency preparedness,  working hours, freely chosen employment, and wages  and benefits. We continue monitoring to ensure that suppliers  demonstrate effective processes to ensure compliance. Specific actions on non-compliance issues vary  depending on the type of finding and supplier. We are in alignment with the UN  Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights, the ILO Declaration  on Fundamental Principles and  Rights at Work, and the UN Universal  Declaration of Human Rights. We evaluated all contract manufacturers and direct   material suppliers on geographic location, manufacturing   processes, past supplier environmental responsibility  performance, and public reports. We worked with suppliers to ensure their compliance  with the principles of zero hiring fees and freely chosen  employment. We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers:  Hours of Work, Working Hours Recording System,  Working Hours Management System, The Hiring  Process, Recruitment and Selection, Hiring and  Working with Migrant Workers, Wages and Benefits,  Creating Motivating Wage Systems, and Improving Your  Dormitories. Health and Safety We focused on keeping our campuses  safe and supporting our employees  through the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethics We continued membership in the  Responsible Minerals Initiative and  participated in its work groups on  due-diligence data collection, and  smelter engagement. We calculated carbon, water, and waste data of all silicon  manufacturers and systems contract manufacturers to  determine carbon emissions and water consumption per  product and per financial outlay. We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers:  Environmental Protection, Managing Energy and  GHG Emissions, Water and Wastewater Management,  Resolving Wastewater Treatment Issues, and Managing  Waste. We assessed compliance with the updated RBA Code  with respect to labor fees and freedom of association. We assigned Learning Academy courses to 11 suppliers:  Understanding Supply Chain Responsibility, Industry  Standards, Responsible Supply Chain Management (for  Factory Management), Supply Chain CSR Monitoring, and  Using kPIs. We are committed to upholding the rights of workers throughout our supply chain  and to treating everyone with dignity and respect. In alignment with the RBA Code,  we comply with the key principles for worker protection outlined in the UN Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights:  
 > No unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in the facility  or unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company-provided facilities. > Workers must be provided with a written employment agreement in their native  language that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment. > All work must be voluntary, and workers may leave work at any time or  terminate their employment. > Employers and agents may not hold or otherwise destroy, conceal, confiscate,  or deny access by employees to their identity or immigration documents. > Workers shall not be required to pay employers’ or agents’ recruitment fees  or other related fees for their employment; any such fees shall be repaid to the  worker. Freely chosen employment is a significant  issue that many supply chains face. When  violations are discovered, we require  suppliers to return hiring fees to workers. We also comply with the RBA’s guidance regarding stakeholder grievances related  to our social and environmental performance. We use the RBA Self-Assessment  Questionnaire and VAP Audit Program to validate that our suppliers have proper  grievance mechanisms in place and that employees are trained to use these  methods. We manage any corrective actions related to grievance mechanisms  through the RBA-Online Corrective Action Plan process. In addition to supporting and aligning with the RBA code regarding freely chosen  labor, we follow the legal requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  and Uk Modern Slavery Act 2015. We track issues through the RBA Validated  Assessment Program and work directly with suppliers to implement any  corrective actions. Anyone can confidentially and anonymously report a concern  about supply chain or human rights issues using a corporate hotline, which is  hosted by an independent third party. When violations are discovered, we require  suppliers to return hiring fees to workers. Policies related to working conditions  can be found on our website. We support, contribute to, and rely on industry-wide efforts to validate the  source of minerals used in our products, ensuring that they come from socially  responsible sources and do not contribute to human conflict. Our goal is to use  only conflict-free gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin in our products. We share an  annual update in our Conflict Minerals Report. We’re a member of the Public Private Alliance (PPA) for Responsible Minerals  Trade, and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The PPA provides funding  and coordination support to organizations working within the Democratic  Republic of Congo and adjacent countries to develop verifiable conflict-free supply  chains; align due diligence programs and practices; encourage responsible  sourcing from the region; promote transparency; and bolster in-region civil  society and governmental capacity. We support these on-the-ground programs  aimed at improving transparency for responsible sourcing and reducing human  rights risks, including forced labor. Our due diligence program regarding conflict  materials conforms in all material respects with the framework recommended  by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Our Conflict Minerals Policy, sourcing goals, and the steps we take to monitor  our supply chain for conflict minerals is framed around the OECD Due Diligence  Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and  High-Risk Areas. This guidance provides detailed recommendations to help  companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict through their  mineral purchasing decisions and practices. Additionally, we participate in various RMI work groups and align our program  with the organization’s tracking of additional minerals and materials and with  geographic areas of high concern. We monitor additional legal requirements,  including the EU Conflict Minerals Regulations, to determine any future  requirements for conflict materials and high-risk regions of the world. In FY20, as the RMI program matured, we began to investigate cobalt in our supply  chain. In FY21 we sent surveys to 100% of our suppliers with approximately a 90%  response rate. We’ve reported the initial results to customers, as requested. The  cobalt program through the RMI is still new and the majority of cobalt refiners in  the world have yet to be identified and audited. As the program matures, our goal  is to only source from conflict-free cobalt refiners. For partners that embed our hardware in their products, quality is monitored  through ISO 9001 certification. We engage with strategic suppliers through QBRs  and use these reviews to influence business allocation decisions. We use a  comprehensive quality management process with the goal of exceeding our  customers’ expectations. Cross-functional teams manage all aspects of product  quality. Customer Quality Engineering provides direct customer support for all  quality-related issues and facilitates the gathering of customer failure information,  customer-observed failure rates, and RMA processing. Product Quality Engineering  uses the Eight Discipline (8D) methodology to direct root cause failure analysis  and corrective actions. As part of the continuous improvement process,  recommended design enhancements are brought to the design engineering teams  for incorporation into next-generation products. NVIDIA is certified to ISO 9001 and has  been issued a “letter of conformance”  to the IATF 16949 automotive quality  standard. Our employees’ ability to perform their jobs well depends on their physical and  mental health and their safety and security. Our integrated programs actively  support these fundamental needs. We support our employees in making their health and their families’ health a  top priority, offering programs throughout the year to assist with their personal  wellness, including health analysis, skin cancer screening, and hereditary  cancer screening. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed our nearly 60 offices around  the world in March 2020. With so many of our employees working remotely for  an extended period, we enhanced the resources we provide to support health  and wellness at home. We added a financial stipend toward ergonomically  designed workstation furniture and IT peripherals for home working, offer regular  well-being educational events, virtual fitness and meditation sessions, and even  a weekly story time for our working families with young children at home. In the  United States, we’ve worked with our healthcare insurance providers to cover  any out-of-pocket costs related to COVID-19 through calendar year 2021 for our  employees and all covered dependents. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we have instituted frequent  COVID-19 prevention measures, including regular disinfection, strict access  control (limited to essential onsite workers only), temperature taking, and strong  social distancing guidelines. See COVID-19 Response for more about our actions  during the pandemic. Our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) team oversees workplace conditions  for NVIDIANs globally. Team members provide guidance to ensure that facilities  meet or exceed local safety requirements, promote safe work practices, and  support compliance with applicable health and safety legislation and policies  through trainings, communications, and audits. Our global EHS management  framework includes:  
keeping our employees safe requires planning for emergencies. Our volunteer  emergency response teams include more than 500 employees around the world. These volunteers assist with evacuation drills and may receive training in basic  first aid, CPR, AED, or fire extinguisher use in addition to emergency preparedness  that will enable them to rapidly respond in an emergency or disaster. Our record reflects the results of our dedication to employee health and wellness. Less than 1% of leave-of-absence requests within NVIDIA relate to work and  work-related injury losses are significantly below the averages for our industry. Our recordable incident rate for FY21 is 0.07 with zero lost workdays. Few workers’  compensation claims are submitted, and the majority of those processed are  repetitive motion injuries. To address this issue, we’ve taken steps to work with  affected employees through our ergonomics program and online courses. We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in  creating long-term value for our stakeholders. To be competitive and execute our  business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented  employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff,  and research and development personnel. The demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is  increasingly competitive. Our intern and new college graduate recruiting  programs are a sustainable source of talent, bringing in more than 1,500 hires  in FY21. We partner with higher education institutions globally to develop  our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our  employees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal  recommendations. Building on the groundbreaking work led a decade ago by Mellanox co-founder Eyal  Waldman, we also hired more than 100 engineers in the Palestinian cities of Hebron,  Nabulus, and Rawabi, who were previously working as contractors at Mellanox,  making us the first international tech company to directly employ engineers in the  Palestinian Authority. To support employee advancement, we provide on-the-job training through  coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We have a rich library of live and on-demand  learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based  forums, and internally-focused technical conferences. We curate learning  libraries around our most common development needs, provide the latest  technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly improve and  update those topics using learner feedback from internal messaging channels. We offer tuition reimbursement programs and subsidize advanced technical  education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage internal  mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship  connections and provide trained coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow us to  personalize programs to address specific career development needs. Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage  employees to invest in the company’s future. To retain employees, while  simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders, we give  them equity with a realized value that is tied to our stock price performance and  vests over time (except where unavailable due to local regulations). We offer comprehensive benefits to support the well-being of our employees and  their families, including 401(k) programs in the United States, statutory pension  programs outside the United States, an employee stock purchase program,  flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress,  and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and  are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including  assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support  for new parents and those who wish to become parents. To ensure pay parity, each year since 2015 we have used a third-party firm,  Economists, Inc., to analyze our pay practices for gender, race, and ethnicity across  75+ dimensions, including education, years of experience, job function, family, job  level, and performance ratings. The firm has not found any statistically significant  disparities in compensation related to gender, race, or ethnicity. We’ve achieved  pay parity for the past several years and plan to continue doing so in FY22. As part of our commitment to promotion parity, we engaged Economists, Inc. in  FY21 to review promotion data from our last three annual performance cycles. The review analyzed the rate and number of promotions, as well as time to  promotion, by gender, race, and ethnicity. This initial review did not yield any  statistically significant variances in promotion rates. If we were to identify an issue of pay or promotion disparity, our human resources  organization would take corrective action. For the fifth year, NVIDIA is on  Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to  Work For. We also ranked No. 2 on  Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work. We treat each individual fairly,   and we don’t tolerate  discrimination or harassment  against anyone on the basis of  race, color, age, gender, sexual  orientation, gender identity and  expression, ethnicity or national  origin, disability, pregnancy,  religion, political affiliation,  union membership, covered  veteran status, protected genetic  information, marital status,  or any other characteristic  protected by law.” We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we’re committed to creating  an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender  identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability. See Workforce  Performance for detailed metrics about our employee diversity. In 2020, we  published our EEO-1 survey for employees in the United States and will continue  to do so. We’ve increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse  workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology  field. Our recruitment efforts reached 47,000 underrepresented candidates in  FY21 through virtual university and professional career events. Last year, we  created the role of head of diversity, inclusion, and belonging and hired a global  diversity recruiting leader. Other efforts we’re undertaking include:   
 > Recruitment and Hiring: We emphasize the recruitment of women and  members of underrepresented communities in technology, specifically focusing  on Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino populations in the United  States. In FY21, we created a dedicated recruiting team that works to find  opportunities for outstanding Black and Hispanic/Latino candidates. > Shepherding candidates from underrepresented communities through  the interviewing process, engaging employees from underrepresented  communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased  investment in historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving  institutions, and professional organizations;  
 > Developing diverse slate of internal talent for open management  positions, beginning semi-annual talent review sessions with executives  to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career  acceleration programs;  
 > Striving to provide hiring managers with a diverse slate of candidates to  consider during the employee hiring process; 
 > Partnering with our community resource groups to improve how we reach  and attract candidates from underrepresented communities; and 
We integrate diversity and inclusion  throughout the entire company. Read more about how we’re building  a better NVIDIA. In May 2021, we sponsored and  participated in RISE 2021, Asia’s  biggest LGBTQI+ job fair. Our virtual  recruitment booth reached over 300  diverse candidates for key roles in  Engineering, IT, Human Resources  and more.  > Development and Recognition: To maximize our employees’ success and  ensure continued diversity and inclusion, we recognize and celebrate their  contributions and encourage lifelong learning. > Committing to pay and promotion equity among women and employees  from underrepresented communities, and having our work audited by a  third party; 
 > Encouraging our leaders to promote diverse talent into management and   executive ranks through focused development and sponsorship of employees; 
 > Submitting top-performing employees for recognition and awards, such as  the YWCA Silicon Valley Tribute to Women awards, which has recognized 33  NVIDIA women leaders in the past nine years. We establish and provide funding to community resource groups, which have  executive-level sponsorship and dedicated budgets: Black NVIDIAN Network,  Early Career Network, Hispanic Latino Network, NV Pride (LGBTQ employees and  allies), NVIDIA Disabilities Network, NVIDIA Veterans, and Women in Technology. We listened to comments from our Women in Technology resource group and  reshaped our parental leave program into one of the most generous in the  industry, enabling birth parents to take up to 22 weeks of fully paid leave, starting  as early as four weeks before their due date. Nonbirth parents get up to 12 weeks  of fully paid leave. To ease the transition back to work after their leave, all new  parents also receive up to eight weeks of flex time. We partnered with our LGBTQ colleagues to provide extensive family-forming  benefits, such as adoption, surrogacy, and IVF. To support our veteran community,  we provide paid military leave. And in response to feedback from the Black  NVIDIAN Network, our health plan partner Cigna has invited Black physicians  and mental health providers used by NVIDIANs to join the network. We’ve also  provided ongoing customized mental health support, coaching, and education for  the community. In FY21, our LGBTQ colleagues shared a concern about the way transgender  people were addressed in our workplace harassment training. We notified  the vendor to revise the content, and the subsequent updates impacted every  employer that uses that vendor. We plan to engage our community resource  groups in future reviews of training content. In FY21, we reviewed our engineering  and other documentation to eliminate  outdated and insensitive language  that is inconsistent with our code of  conduct and principles of inclusivity. We recognize that communication  patterns are learned habits and take  practice and effort to modify, and we  encourage our engineers to do their  best to ingrain new positive habits. In FY21, we added the capability for   employees to voluntarily share and   view personal pronouns in the company  directory, based on requests for this  functionality from various members  of the LGBTQ community, including  our own NV Pride community resource   group and partners we work with  across NVIDIA. We set internal goals to increase our hiring of women and underrepresented  communities in technology, track our success, and make any needed adjustments to  ensure a diverse, representative workforce. Our perspectives on diversity extend beyond employees and recruits and into  our indirect supply chain. We have taken steps to better understand the diversity  of our vendors in the United States and are working to educate those who  make purchasing decisions to include minority-owned businesses in the vendor  selection process. Our commitment to diversity extends beyond our company to include partners,  organizations, and institutions. In FY21, we hired a head of strategic initiatives to  build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population. We’re expanding the pipeline of AI developers, from those in high school to  university to working professionals. Our partners in these efforts include: ARC  Network, National Society for Black Engineers, Queer in AI, Rewriting the Code,  Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Stanford University’s Black  and Latinx engineering societies. See Building the STEM Pipeline for   our k-12 activities. We’ve increased our outreach to historically Black colleges and universities  (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), engaging with computer  science departments around training, curriculum, and technology resources. FY21 investments include donating technology to support a school hackathon,  consulting support through our solutions architect organization, and complimentary  training passes to our annual developers conferences. In FY22 we’re launching  an immersion program for first- and second-year students at HBCUs and  HSIs to motivate and encourage the continuation of computer science and  engineering studies. We sponsor the ARCS Foundation, Queer in AI, and Women in Machine Learning. In addition to sponsorships, we participate in mentorship opportunities for Black  in AI, Latinx in AI, and Rewriting the Code. Each year, we hold our developers forum, the GPU Technology Conference, in a  series of events worldwide. GTC is an opportunity to extend our inclusion efforts  to our external ecosystem. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all 2020 GTC events  shifted online, further enabling access by more developers. We invited an all-women panel from the University of Florida, the Boys and Girls  Club of Western Pennsylvania, and AI4All, a nonprofit working to increase diversity  and inclusion in AI, to discuss the importance of AI exposure and education for  children and young adults from underrepresented communities. For our fall 2020 conference, we reached 4x the number of women, 2x the  number of Black/African American developers, and 3x the number of Hispanic/ Latino developers than we did the previous year. Other activities to increase  the number of women and technologists from underrepresented communities  attending GTC included:   
 > Providing free conference and NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute training passes  to HBCUs, HSIs, and professional organizations Black in AI and Latinx in AI; 
 > Reaching out to women in our university and developer network, which helped  to increase representation of women speakers; and 
We also created an inclusion taskforce to review all marketing materials to ensure  broader global representation of customers, developers, and innovators. Improving the representation of women and underrepresented communities  in technology requires a long-term perspective, so we support opportunities that  provide at-potential youth access to STEM and AI education. These efforts are  designed to inspire students through our technology, engage them directly with  NVIDIA engineers, and encourage innovation through hands-on activities. In FY21, we continued our longtime partnership with global education nonprofit  Technovation, which aims to empower girls and families to become leaders,  creators, and problem-solvers through technology. NVIDIANs served as mentors  for an online entrepreneurship program, led by Technovation and UNESCO, which  encouraged girls to use AI to solve a problem in their communities. Employees  also volunteered as judges for the Technovation Families program, which  introduces students and families in underserved communities to AI through  hands-on learning. We also helped organizations, including Breakthrough Silicon Valley, CodePath,  MESA, and SuitUp, through virtual volunteer activities during which employees  served as judges and mentors for STEM competitions and participated in mock  interviews and resume workshops. We funded organizations like Black Girls Code, Bridging Tech Charitable Fund,  Education Empowers, and Girls Who Code through our matching gifts program  and fundraisers organized by our Santa Clara office and our Women in Tech  community resource group. As we look ahead to FY22, we’ve entered into a three-year partnership with the  Boys & Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania to create access to AI for students  in underrepresented communities through the development of the AI Pathways  Toolkit, an open-source curriculum supported by staff tools and training. The  toolkit will be scaled to other Boys & Girls Clubs across the United States and  made freely available to other groups interested in implementing AI education  programs around the world. For 26 years, we’ve pushed the boundaries of what‘s possible in the world of  parallel computing. We’ve succeeded because we’re focused and passionate  about what we do. To ensure our continued success, we maintain a working  environment where our employees are engaged and inspired. Our corporate culture arises from five core values, which provide the foundation  for success. These values create a workplace where innovation thrives and  mistakes are transformed into opportunities. We make things that delight customers  and raise industry standards. We  encourage employees to innovate, guided by first principles, not consensus. We know our path to discovery will be paved with mistakes. We anticipate and  avoid the ones we can. We accept, learn from, and share the ones that occur. This allows us to invent things the world doesn’t even know it needs, and by  doing so, invent the future. We operate at the highest ethical standards. We seek  to accurately know  ourselves and our capabilities—acknowledging our weaknesses and learning  from our mistakes. The sharpest understanding of reality improves our work. Identifying the  origins of mistakes is not about blame. It is essential to learning and constant  improvement. We say what we believe, and have the courage to act on it. We are alert and constantly learning, and adjust course to align to new  realities. This lets us create groundbreaking products at astonishing speed. No politics, no hierarchy stands in the way of inventing the future. We hire extraordinarily talented individuals across the globe, people  determined to make a difference. We challenge ourselves to do our best work. We measure ourselves not against the competition, but against perfection— we call it the speed-of-light test. We are not deterred by lengthy endeavors if  they are worthy. We are playing a long game. We foster an environment of transparency, openness, and sharing  information. One that motivates our employees, and empowers them to  work as a single integrated team. We disagree openly and directly because conflict is essential to resolving  differences, improving ideas, and achieving alignment. Our focus is on  substance, not on style. By putting the interests of the company before our  own, we can more easily accomplish NVIDIA’s vision. We’ve shifted from an annual employee survey to frequent pulse surveys. The  purpose of these is to measure employee engagement levels and culture against  employees’ experiences as our workforce shifts and we continue to grow. We’re  able to analyze data across multiple pulses, along with other data resources,  to draw correlations over time and pivot as necessary. This new agile approach  allows us to hear from employees more frequently and stay focused on specific  areas, while reacting quickly to current events. Our surveys ask for feedback across 13 dimensions, including strength of culture,  engagement, vision and direction, connection, and meaningful work. The survey  repeatedly tells us that our employees feel great pride in the company. We’re committed to a strong workplace culture that listens to employees. In  addition to pulse surveys, we receive feedback through an internal portal where  all employees can submit, view, and vote on suggestions. Over the last year,  we’ve converted employee feedback into company-wide policies and programs,  including the addition of reimbursements and support for employees working  from home, and a one-week global holiday shutdown to allow employees  to recharge. We’ve also made updates to our tools and resources based on  employee suggestions. Recent examples include the addition of SSO payroll  access in India, and an enhancement of our internal wiki page to improve  inclusivity of commonly used terms. To address the stress of COVID-19 on employees, we’ve increased awareness of  our wellness programs and encouraged managers to keep employee connections  strong with a variety of virtual team-building events like cooking challenges,  game nights, and happy hours. We provide effective grievance mechanisms for our employees. To report practices  or actions believed to be inappropriate or illegal, employees have several channels   through which to report, including our human resources department, a suggestion  box, and a hotline hosted by an independent third party. We also participate in external “best place to work” surveys to identify our strengths  and opportunities to improve to make our company a great place for all employees. We value the sentiment of our employees and use it to help guide our decisions. Our strengths include listening to employee feedback and taking action, which  allow employees to have a voice and impact in the company. NVIDIANs share a passion for meaningfully supporting the communities in which  we live and do business. Through our Inspire 365 initiative, the NVIDIA Foundation  helps turn this passion for giving into action. Led by four staff members in  partnership with employee champions around the world, the initiative aims to  empower all NVIDIANs to get involved in their communities. Inspire 365 makes it easy. Through matching gifts, flexible time-off, and a variety  of activities and tools, employees can contribute where, when, and how they  choose. Our collective, year-round efforts allow us to help those in need and  strengthen communities around the globe. Our giving efforts focused on fundraising, and featured two company-wide  campaigns supported by special matching opportunities that netted nearly $13.5  million to help those impacted by the pandemic. Including contributions from our  year-round matching program, we contributed more than $19 million through  employee donations and company matching in FY21. While our company-organized volunteer events were paused due to COVID-related  office closures, NVIDIANs still logged more than 9,000 volunteer hours through  individual and virtual efforts. And our new Missions program encourages  employees to complete simple acts of good through monthly challenges. Through  Missions such as supporting underrepresented groups in the workplace and  encouraging environmental sustainability, employees took more than 60,000  small actions to support their communities and the well-being of themselves and  their families while working from home. AI represents the most profound technological shift in our era, touching  virtually every industry, including robotics, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare,  transportation, retail, human resources, and customer service. NVIDIA is  accelerating this revolution by creating advanced computing tools that serve  as open platforms for developers, researchers, and data scientists to innovate  in these areas. We educate tens of thousands of developers each year, partner  with thousands of startups globally—many of which are using AI to benefit  society—and collaborate with dozens of universities and research organizations  in performing groundbreaking AI research. We play a role around the world and across industries to enable software  algorithms and AI solutions that benefit daily life. Our hardware, software,  platforms, and full-stack solutions hold huge opportunities but come with  risks. We have a responsibility to address ethical issues within our product  ecosystem and are taking steps to manage the underlying risks. In FY21, we hired a lead of AI and Legal Ethics to develop and implement  companywide trustworthy AI principles. We closely monitor the activities of  regulatory bodies and standards committees around the world as guidance is  given on AI trustworthiness. We consider United States, European Union, and  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines, and we  plan to join the IEEE effort to develop more comprehensive standards around  AI in FY22. We understand and share the widespread concerns about maintaining unbiased,  trustworthy practices in AI. That’s why our global teams align to risk based,  fit for purpose standards of accountability, transparency, and explainability in  everything they do. We share our AI technology expertise with others to help  them do the same. For example, we host seminars at GTC events around the  world to train developers in upholding best practices, and when engaging with  governments, we emphasize the importance of supporting positive uses of AI  while considering issues inherent in its development. We aim to promote a broader cross-company trustworthy AI framework by  leveraging existing programs and frameworks to support a comprehensive  position, while developing efficient, bespoke controls across products and  services. While we’re in the early stages, we envision an AI product life cycle  overlay, enhancing our existing workflows by applying existing practices, linking  ethical and legal principles with development flow, and enhancing the product  release process. NVIDIA’s Anima Anandkumar spoke  on the Radical AI podcast about  democratizing AI through inclusivity,  accountability, and collaboration. She  leads the research group at NVIDIA  that develops next-generation AI  algorithms and is also the youngest  named chair professor at Caltech,  where she co-leads the AI4science  initiative. Through our work with leading scientists and engineers to create the world’s  most powerful AI supercomputers, we’ve learned a lot about what it takes to  implement AI successfully—and where the pitfalls are. Our in-house research  team applies best practices in its work and contributes to the development of  engineering solutions that address some of AI’s fundamental challenges, such as  data privacy and bias. We communicate to developers that they should consider  potential algorithmic bias when choosing or creating models and that they must  ensure they’re using models under the conditions and in the manner intended. In FY21, we worked with the University of Helsinki on differential privacy, a  method for guaranteeing that a computation based on personal data will keep  that data private. Differential privacy made MIT Technology Review’s top 10 list of  breakthroughs with the promise of profound impact. Our project demonstrated  a way to accelerate training for differential privacy by 100x by running it on GPUs,  while showing how to make anonymous versions of highly valuable datasets that  must remain private because they contain sensitive personal information. NVIDIA Maxine uses generative adversarial networks to boost bandwidth  performance by using a neural network to compress and decompress video for  transmission, enabling video calls with one-tenth the network bandwidth users  typically need. This technology could reduce future bandwidth consumption by  orders of magnitude as video conferencing gains popularity. Our research team  paid close attention to racial, gender, age, and cultural diversity while developing  the AI features in the NVIDIA Maxine platform. They curated about a thousand  hours of video training data with representation across broad communities so that   the technology will be usable by as many people as possible, from all backgrounds. Safety is a principle that permeates our engineering culture and is incorporated  into every step of our product development process, from design and production  to the end-user experience. The safety of our customers—inclusive of our  partners and consumers—is important to us as a company and as individuals. We  must meet customer safety and compliance standards; if our products are not in  compliance, our partners may not incorporate them into their design strategies. Our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety  standards could affect the results of our business. With this in mind, we’ve  established product safety technical committees to oversee safety throughout  the product lifecycle. All NVIDIA consumer product safety recalls are reported to the U.S. Consumer Product  Safety Commission. We have had no consumer product safety recalls since 2017. We are transforming the autonomous vehicle industry with technology that  improves road safety, increases transportation efficiency, and opens mobility  services to all. Safety is more than just a benefit of an autonomous future. It’s  a principle that we incorporate into every step of our development process— from design and production to the operation of self-driving vehicles. As a  solutions provider to startups, vehicle makers, suppliers, sensor makers, and  mapping companies in the autonomous vehicle industry, we make safety  our first priority. Experts build safety into every aspect of our NVIDIA DRIVE  autonomous vehicle platform that enables automakers and tier-1 suppliers to  accelerate their production of self-driving vehicles. It scales from a palm-sized,   energy-efficient module for SAE Level 2 capabilities, to a powerful AI  supercomputer capable of autonomous driving. We develop tools and methods  so technologies will perform reliably. Stringent engineering processes ensure  that no corners are cut. Our safety priorities and processes are outlined in our  latest Self-Driving Car Safety Report. Our commitment to safety extends throughout our data collection, training, testing,  and driving solutions for autonomous vehicles, as we deliver industry-leading  technologies to our partners and customers. Safe autonomous driving is built on  four fundamental pillars. With high-performance compute at their core, these  tenets illustrate NVIDIA’s dedication to safety and ensure a robust self-driving  technology development cycle. We are developing for compliance with ISO 26262, an automotive-specific  international functional safety standard that focuses on safety-critical components. NVIDIA has been working with TÜV SÜD, a top safety assessment company, to  assess and certify NVIDIA’s processes, concept architectures, and products since  FY18. In FY21, our NVIDIA xavier SoC was assessed to meet ISO 26262 standard  random hardware integrity of ASIL C and a systematic capability of ASIL D for  process—the strictest for functional safety. In FY21, advisory firm Navigant Research released its 2020 Automated Vehicle  Compute Platforms report, in which NVIDIA led the list of companies developing  AV platforms to power the AI that will replace the human driver. We contributed  to research exploring “what happens when AI agents in driving environments are  simply tasked with getting to destinations as quickly as possible without crashing  into one another.” NVIDIA DRIVE was one of three autonomous vehicle initiatives  selected by California’s Contra Costa Transportation Authority to estimate just how  much intelligent transportation can improve the efficiency of everyday commutes. Building on our investment in automotive safety, we’re expanding functional  and system safety toward autonomous machines in general, such as robotics,  smart manufacturing, and new frontiers of healthcare. Requirements of specific  standards such as ISO 13849 and IEC 61508 are considered and applied in our  product research, development, and engineering functions. We calculate scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for our global data centers and offices  by gathering primary data for all data centers and offices larger than 50,000  square feet (86% of our total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions) and estimating  emissions for offices less than 50,000 square feet (the remaining 14%). In FY20 we set a goal to source 65% of our global electricity use from renewable  energy by the end of FY25. We estimated that by delivering on these commitments  we would reduce our total scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% between FY19 and  FY25, which would be in line with science-based targets to achieve a 1.5-degree  Celsius warming scenario. We are currently re-evaluating our forward-looking  GHG trajectory, taking our business growth including recent acquisitions into   consideration, to inform a science-based reduction target aligned with a  1.5-degree Celsius warming scenario. In FY21, we sourced renewable energy for 17 locations and obtained 25% of our  total electricity use from renewable energy resources. Read more about our  environmental goals in Energy, Water, and Waste. Our business causes GHG emissions beyond our direct footprint. We currently  report several scope 3 emissions categories, including business travel and fuel and  energy-related activities. Since 2014, we have required our key manufacturing  suppliers to report their energy usage, GHG emissions data, and reduction goals  and objectives. Read more about GHG emissions in our supply chain in Supplier  Environmental Management. In 2021, we will expand our scope 3 emissions inventory to include all relevant  sources, such as our manufacturing supply chain and downstream product use  and disposal. We expect to report our expanded inventory results in external  reporting in 2022. We will also evaluate setting a science-based target. Trucost provides limited assurance under the AA1000AS v3 assurance standards  on our FY21 global scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and scope 3 fuel- and   energy-related activities (category 3) and business travel (category 6). View the  assurance statement. How we plan, pack, and execute our raw material, work-in-progress, and  finished-goods shipments impacts our scope 3 emissions. Fuel represents  a significant portion of our overall freight costs, and our continuous focus on  optimizing our transport and logistics has resulted in cost savings and lessened  our impact on the environment. Improvements include:   
 > Using a multimodal (ocean/truck) replenishment program within the United  States and for retail distribution outside the country;  
 > Using reverse logistics solutions that use onsite or regional failure verification  and repair to streamline product returns and eliminate international shipments. We gather data from shipping partners related to the carbon emissions of our  shipments from air, land, and sea. > Scope 3: Emissions from  purchased goods and services,  capital goods, fuel and energy  related activities, product  transportation, operational waste,  business travel, commuting, and  upstream leased assets. We’re committed to protecting the environment by driving operational excellence  in ways that reduce our environmental impact. In support of this commitment,  we identify and control environmental impacts and continuously improve our  performance using a comprehensive environmental management system (EMS)  certified to ISO 14001. See Environmental Performance for a broad list of metrics  we track related to the environment. Our Environmental, Health, Safety, and Energy Policy provides the framework for  our EMS. Our dedicated Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) and CSR teams  work closely with employees globally to execute our environmental policies and  practices, which are made actionable through goals and metrics that are annually  reviewed with executives. Building on this success, we've implemented an energy  management system aligned with the ISO 50001 standard to bring a more  structured approach to managing energy efficiency at several of our key data  center locations that contribute significantly to our global energy usage. Our indirect environmental impact includes our product manufacturing supply  chain. We require our key manufacturers to track and report energy, water, and   waste metrics and to share their reduction goals and initiatives with us. See   Supplier Environmental Management and Scope 3 Emissions for more information. Our global network of office  managers collaborates to share  sustainability best practices. In FY21,  we tracked 56 actions implemented  in our global offices and all regions in  which we operate. Since 2019, more  than 180 actions in the Sustainability  Diary have been implemented. Energy use, specifically electricity use, is the primary driver of our scope 1 and  2 GHG emissions. Our total energy use increased by 33% in FY21 compared to  FY20, with approximately 60% of the increase arising from our FY21 acquisition  of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. and approximately 40% of the increase driven by  growth in our data center operations. Global data center operations have been  growing rapidly along with our expanding business and our diversification into  new online services. Data centers were responsible for almost half (46%) of our total energy use in  FY21, with offices making up the remainder. As we expand our footprint, we are  incorporating energy efficiency into the design of new buildings under our  ownership, and we include energy efficiency and other sustainability attributes  as selection criteria when evaluating new leased spaces. In FY21 we saw new renewable energy supply contracts come online at our new  supercomputer site in Cambridge, U.k., and for our data center in Dallas. We are  actively exploring options to increase our sourcing of renewable energy for our  growing footprint, in support of our 65% renewable energy goal. We use water in our direct operations in cooling towers and for food service,  landscaping, and sanitation. We take steps to use water efficiently, particularly in  locations that are vulnerable to drought conditions, such as California and Israel,  where we have large facilities. As we develop and grow at our headquarters,  we’re implementing measures to conserve water resources and reduce our  potable water demand. We first conducted a water risk assessment in 2018 and  update it annually for all NVIDIA facilities, third-party data centers, and strategic  supply chain partners. This helps us to target water conservation initiatives to  locations where they are most needed. Our headquarters building in Santa Clara, CA, incorporates a range of water  conservation measures. Through the installation of low-flow bathroom fixtures  and the use of recycled water for toilet flushing, the building is designed to  achieve a 42% reduction in domestic water demand and a 91% reduction in  potable water use for sewage conveyance. We use reclaimed water in the  building’s cooling towers and landscape irrigation systems, and our landscaping  consists of native, drought-resistant plants. We are incorporating similar water  efficiency features and the use of recycled water for cooling towers, toilet  flushing, and irrigation into the design of a second building under construction  at our headquarters campus. In FY21, we installed water-efficient fixtures and automatic faucets at our  Shenzhen, China, and Bangalore, India, locations, as well as water-efficient  dishwashing equipment in Bangalore. Our Hyderabad site has a water  treatment plant which treats  wastewater from the site. The treated  wastewater is used for landscape  irrigation. In the last year, we implemented a range of measures such as simplifying and  consolidating waste segregation at our Bangalore, Beijing, Warsaw, Munich, and  Santa Clara offices with the goal of increasing our landfill diversion rates. Our employee restaurants and catering activities are an important focus for our  waste program. Specific initiatives include replacing disposables with durable,  washable tableware in our employee restaurants, a food-waste tracking system,  replacing single-use items such as straws, and partnering with our food services  vendor to make routine donations of food to homeless shelters. Our offices in  India have eliminated disposable cups and plastics and ensure all paper products  are recycled. We have tracked total waste generated and diverted at our headquarters since  FY08. Our annual goal for landfill diversion is 80%. In FY21, we achieved a 68%  rate overall (62% of our operational waste and 71% of our construction project  waste was diverted). Our employee restaurants were closed or operated at  limited capacity for most of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Catering  waste is the biggest component of our office related recycling and compost  waste streams, and in FY21 we saw a more significant reduction in these diverted  waste streams relative to primarily lab type wastes sent to landfill. This in turn  negatively impacted our diversion rate. We generate various types of e-waste, including servers, storage equipment,  and networking equipment used in our data centers; computers, monitors, and  other electronic equipment used by our employees; and NVIDIA products we use  at our sites for testing and other purposes. We partner with a global specialist  e-waste vendor to ensure proper tracking, decommissioning, and recycling of our  e-waste. Our logistics team has also implemented a new inventory management  process that will improve visibility to our furniture and lab assets and support  redeployment of these for internal reuse. In calendar year 2020, we partnered  with NGO Saahas to implement a  solid waste management project  in Ejipura slum for two years. The  project includes implementing source  segregation, establishing primary  and secondary collection systems,  composting of biodegradable waste,  establishing systems for ongoing  community ownership, and promoting  awareness and sensitization. Through  this effort, the living standards  of up to 8,000 households will be  transformed, by reducing greenhouse  gases, creating visibly cleaner areas,  eliminating the burning of waste, and   reducing instances of sanitation-related  diseases due to regular collection  of segregated waste. The project  will also provide employment and  improved livelihoods for people hired  to oversee collections and waste  processing stations. The environmental management system at our Silicon Valley headquarters, as  well as our corporate processes for product design, procurement, and  manufacturing supply chain management, has been certified to ISO 14001 with  zero nonconformances identified since FY06. See Energy, Water, and Waste for  information on our Environmental Management System. Data center operations have been growing rapidly along with our expanding  business and our diversification into new online services. As we experience this  increase in our global data center footprint, we are incorporating environmental  considerations, including energy efficiency and renewable power options, into our  data center siting and sourcing evaluations. In the last two years we have newly  secured renewable power for several colocation data centers both in the United  States and globally. As we have grown our data center operations, we’ve deployed state-of-the-art  cooling technology designed for NVIDIA server products. Power distribution has  increased voltage supply to deliver power more efficiently. Cooling solutions are  closely coupled with server racks to localize and optimize heat transfer. We used  computational fluid dynamics models to enhance cooling for data center designs  and server rack deployments. Data centers have also been equipped with white  surfaces to optimize reflective lighting. Controllable, high-efficiency LED lighting  is installed where artificial lighting is needed. We share our data center best practices and optimizations with customers and  partners to educate them and optimize deployments. For example, in partnership  with leading storage and networking technology providers, we offer a portfolio of  reference architectures for optimal and efficient deployment of our DGx server  products, and we make these publicly available on our website. IT lab environments are an important feature of several of our larger sites, where  they support our product development and testing operations. Lab spaces are  typically energy intensive due to the tools and equipment needed to complete  important development and testing tasks. Our dedicated lab strategy team is  rethinking the way labs are designed and managed at NVIDIA. This starts with  a focus on data, using innovative technologies to provide a complete picture of  how labs, and the tools and equipment contained within them, are used. This data  informs our enhanced forecasting for future lab needs, more efficient deployment  of existing tools and equipment, consolidation of energy-intensive lab operations,  and planning for new lab spaces, which will dramatically increase the efficiency  of our overall lab footprint. In FY21, we conducted a climate risk scenario analysis of global data center and  lab locations under two climate scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathway  (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. See Climate Risk for more details. In FY21, NVIDIA Corporate IT  completed an operating system  refresh in our data centers. We  decommissioned 105 physical  servers and 959 virtual machines,  reducing more than 40% of the  workload on our servers. Our rapid and significant business growth and the urgent climate action  imperative mean that we must focus on siting expansions strategically, managing  our operations efficiently, and sourcing low-carbon and renewable forms of  energy to manage our GHG emissions footprint. As our building systems become  more sophisticated, we provide our facilities management teams with additional  tools and training to ensure continued performance. In FY21, we expanded our portfolio of certified green buildings with the addition  our new EMEA headquarters in Munich, Germany, which has also earned LEED  Gold certification. To reduce its scope 1 emissions, the building relies on a local  geothermal heating source and internal heat recovery technology to reduce  by 85% its dependence on traditional heating and cooling energy sources. Furthermore, the site will use 50% less energy than a comparable new building,  and when it does need to draw electricity from the grid, we have sourced 100%  renewable electricity through a green tariff. Our newest completed building at our Silicon Valley headquarters in Santa  Clara, CA, is LEED Gold certified. It was designed with high levels of energy  efficiency in mind, including a high-performing building envelope, efficient  and smart lighting systems that incorporate the use of daylight, underfloor  air distribution, radiant heating and cooling, air and waterside economizers,  and high-efficiency boilers and chillers. An advanced building control system  underpins the building’s operation. We are also aiming for LEED Gold certification for another new building under  construction at our headquarters. In addition to similarly advanced levels of  energy- and water-efficient design, this building will feature biophilic elements  and a shade-providing external trellis that will house 2,000 bi-facial solar panels  to harness the location’s 260 days of sunshine per year. We established a Green2Work program at our Silicon Valley headquarters in FY15  to support our employees in using alternative commute options and reducing their  commute impacts. The program includes 39 electric vehicle charging stations,  pre-tax dollars for transit and local transit shuttles, last-mile shuttle service for  train riders, resources for cyclists, advantages for carpooling and vanpooling,  shuttles from San Francisco and Fremont, and an online resource for commuters. For cyclists, we provide lockers, showers, and secure bike parking. To assist our  alternative commuters in the event of an emergency, we offer an emergency ride  home program through ride-sharing services. Most of our employees have been working remotely since the COVID-19 pandemic  hit in March 2020. Working from home reduced the need for commuting  programs. Ahead of employees returning to the office, we will evaluate what  commute options will provide the most impact or may need adjustment. For  more information about how we have supported employees working from home,  see Our Response to COVID-19. The NVIDIA DGx SuperPOD system  captured the top spot on the  Green500 list of most efficient  supercomputers, achieving a new  world record in power efficiency  of 26.2 gigaflops per watt. Whether we’re designing technology to power next-generation laptops or creating  designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy  efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our research, development, and design  processes. GPUs are ideal for matrixed calculations for AI, high-performance  computing, data analytics, and graphics while CPUs are more optimal for  performing tasks sequentially. GPU-accelerated computing moves compute-intensive sections of the applications  to the GPU while remaining sections execute in the CPU. As a result, sequential  calculations are performed in the CPU while the more complicated matrix  calculations are computed in parallel in the GPU. Parallel processing performed  by GPUs consumes far less power than equivalent, traditional computational  forms such as CPUs. NVIDIA’s computing platform enables modern data centers to accelerate  increasingly common deep learning, machine learning, and HPC workloads, and  accelerated computing is, on average, 15x more efficient than traditional data  centers across these diverse workloads. NVIDIA GPUs are up to 42x more energy efficient than traditional CPU servers  for AI workloads. Our HGx-A100 cloud-server platform links 16 NVIDIA A100  Tensor Core GPUs to work as a single, giant GPU, delivering 10 petaflops of AI  performance, a record in AI training compute power for a single server. In just two years, an NVIDIA AI system has reduced the time to train the image  recognition model ResNet-50 from eight hours to 40 minutes on a single server. As adoption of AI accelerates, our focus is shifting from training to inference— putting trained models to work in live applications run by millions of hyperscale  servers worldwide. Our TensorRT inference software helps even the largest  neural networks across a broad range of data center, embedded, and automotive  applications run in real time. A single A100 is 237x faster than a CPU. A hyperscale  data center with NVIDIA GPUs and TensorRT takes up 1/47th of the rack space  compared to CPU-based systems that it replaces and runs at 95% lower energy  cost while providing utility to run all AI models. The MLPerf consortium provides a machine-learning benchmark that measures  system performance for training and inference from mobile devices to cloud  services. In all eight MLPerf training categories, NVIDIA demonstrated  world-class performance and versatility. Our AI platform set 16 records in  training performance, including eight at scale and eight on a per-accelerator  basis. And in MLPerf’s latest inference benchmark, NVIDIA topped all benchmarks  for offline and server data center scenarios. Our NVIDIA A100 GPUs provide the  highest performance per processor among commercially available products. The NVIDIA xavier AI computer ranked as the highest performer among  commercially available edge and mobile SoCs under single- and multistream  edge-focused scenarios. Four years ago, we introduced Max-Q, a system design approach that enables  thin and light gaming laptops to deliver high performance with optimal  efficiency. Max-Q has been a paradigm shift in the way laptops are designed  and built. Every component and element of the laptop—from GPU, CPU, and  software to PCB design, power delivery, and thermals—is optimized for power  efficiency and performance. In FY21, we launched new desktop-class GeForce RTx 30 Series graphics cards. These GPUs offer up to 2x the performance and 1.9x the power efficiency over  the previous generation. And in early 2021, we launched GeForce RTx 30 Series  laptops, which are packed with third-generation Max-Q technologies and use AI  and new system optimizations to deliver substantial improvements in efficiency,  performance, battery life, and acoustics. One of the biggest energy-efficiency improvement technologies we introduced  is Dynamic Boost 2.0, which uses AI to balance power among the CPU, GPU, and  GPU memory. It is available on all GeForce RTx 30 Series Max-Q laptops and is  enabled out of the box, helping maximize performance in every app and game. Traditionally, gaming laptops statically set the power for the GPU and CPU. Yet,  games and creative apps are dynamic, and demands on the system change  from frame to frame. The AI networks in Dynamic Boost 2.0 manage power on a  per-frame basis, so the laptop is constantly determining where power is needed  the most and optimizing for maximum performance. Whether the application is  loading the CPU, the GPU, or the GPU memory, the result is a larger performance  boost than ever. In Dynamic Boost 2.0, AI technology monitors the workload to infer the  performance benefit from steering up to 20W of surplus power from CPU to GPU  and vice versa. This allows net performance to match the performance of a laptop  that was designed with an additional 20W power budget, achieving 20% power  savings relative to a laptop designed with 100W thermal-design power for GPU. Figure 1: Dynamic Boost 2.0 shows  significant performance gains at the same  power budget when shifting power between  the CPU and GPU across a variety of  applications run at 1080p. Measurements  performed at NVIDIA performance lab on  RTx 3080 graphics cards for laptop gaming. AI technology in Dynamic Boost 2.0 also monitors the workload on GPU core and  GPU memory to infer the optimal memory clock and power state and shift power  from GPU memory to GPU and vice versa. This allows net performance to match  the performance of a laptop that was designed with an additional power budget of  about 3-5W statically assigned to GPU memory. Together, these optimizations reduce power consumption by about 20-25% when  compared to a laptop system that was designed for the same performance level. Conversely, a laptop with Dynamic Boost 2.0 delivers 12-15% higher performance  than a same power laptop without it. We strive to optimize a balance of protecting the environment and ensuring  that our customers receive their products in excellent condition. Our bulk carton   packaging uses corrugate material that is 100% recycled fibers and the cartons  maintain an overall recyclability rate of 100%. Consumer packaging uses 70%  recycled fibers and maintains a recyclability rate above 75%. We take every   opportunity to reduce packing materials and increase the proportion of recyclable  materials used. Whether products are packaged for end-users or prepared for  bulk shipping, we design our containers to maximize package density and reduce  overall package size. In FY21, we continued the environmental protection initiatives we initiated five  years ago, which included development of smaller and lighter-weight packaging  and creating a “core box” system so that primary packaging and shipping carton  boxes can be shared among product SkUs. With product protection in mind, we  use recyclable HDPE-2 in place of polystyrene PS-6 material wherever plastics  are required. Our top priorities include removing film lamination, which in most  communities renders packaging non-recyclable; switching the brand appearance  from black ink to white, which facilitates removal of laminate; and switching tray  components from plastics to paper-based materials. Figure 2: Dynamic Boost 2.0 shows  significant performance gains at the same  power budget when shifting power between  the GPU memory and GPU core across  a variety of applications run at 1080p. Measurements performed at NVIDIA  performance lab on RTx 3080 graphics  cards for laptop gaming. For automotive systems and our server products, such as the DGx-2 and RTx  Server, which require shipping in a large cardboard box with protective foam, we  aim to maximize recyclability in all packaging materials. Other ongoing efforts to recycle and reduce packaging include using vegetable- oil-based or water-based printing inks, using suppliers that leverage distribution  centers to minimize the shipping footprint of packing/packaging materials, and  applying materials labels to 100% of our packages to simplify consumer recycling. Whenever possible, we reuse moisture-barrier bags, trays, and bulk cartons; ship  products directly to the retail distributor; and use existing packaging for return  merchandise authorization support, which further reduces the environmental  impact and ecological footprint. We’re also reducing paper use by providing online  instructions wherever possible. In FY21, we introduced multi-carton packaging systems with fewer and smaller   paper components and replacement of foams with 100% recycled and/or recyclable   HDPE-2 plastic “cushions”. We also engaged packaging suppliers around  NVIDIA’s energy goals and supplier energy performance to lay the foundation for  initiatives to reduce the energy used in the manufacture of our packaging. More regional, national and sub-national governments are regulating the disposal  of electrical and electronic equipment waste by placing the responsibility for  end-of-life management on the producer of the equipment. NVIDIA-branded  products, such as our SHIELD gaming devices, are subject to such requirements  in our various global markets, and we take seriously our extended responsibility  for these products. In key regions such as the United States and Europe, we have  established recycling programs in partnership with reputable third parties and  we provide information to consumers about how to recycle our branded products,  including through our product recycling page.

Continue to track in line with LEED Gold criteria for our new Silicon Valley headquarters building We gather information for this report at the end of the fiscal year, and the data points in the accompanying charts  reflect a snapshot of our workforce at that time. We are committed to providing equitable opportunities for advancement to all employees. See Talent Strategy,  Diversity, and Inclusion for our approach to promotion and retention of our workforce. In FY21, we promoted 11.4% of our workforce. Of the 2,156 promotions, women comprised 420 (19.5%, which is  roughly the total percentage in the company). Women continue to be promoted at similar rates to men, 11.6%  compared to 11.5%. Promotion rates are evaluated across underrepresented communities in technology to ensure  they achieve parity, which was the case for women and Hispanic/Latino employees. In the last year, we doubled  representation of Black/African American employees in our workforce, and thus the resulting promotion rate within  that community dropped significantly due to the number of new hires. We expect promotion percentages to balance  out over the next two years as new hires become eligible for promotion. We historically maintain a low turnover rate. In FY21, our overall turnover rate of 3.8% remains in the single digits,  compared to AON’s hardware industry average of 15.3%. The turnover rate for women and men has remained  similar for the past several years. In the United States, retention rates for members of underrepresented  communities have held equal to their peers. Pay parity is a priority at the company. Since 2015, we have analyzed our pay practices annually across 75+ dimensions,  which has allowed us to reach full parity. After welcoming thousands of new employees through acquisitions in FY21,  our latest assessment found that women earned, on average, 98.2 cents for every dollar men earned performing similar  jobs. In response, we will evaluate all factors that explain it and implement corrective actions. We gather information for this report at the end of the fiscal year, and the data points in the accompanying tables  reflect a snapshot of our workforce at that time. Employees can self-identify during the interview process, while onboarding, and any time during their tenure at  NVIDIA to their manager or on our internal HR platform. Individuals can request an accommodation by contacting  a dedicated email alias. For a breakdown of positions held by gender, racial, and ethnic groups in the United States, see our 2020 EEO report. Due to rounding, numbers presented in the tables below may not add up precisely to the totals indicated and  percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures for the same reason. For FY21, we report our inventory  with acquisitions completed by NVIDIA. a As of FY21, emissions from waste generated in operation are calculated only for our headquarter locations in Santa Clara, CA, and not  inclusive of global operations. Emission factors are based on U.S. EPA Waste Reduction Model (WARM), version 16, updated January 2020.  
b As of FY21, we included remote working emissions in Scope 3 employee commute to account for our workforce working remotely for a  significant part of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed the methodology published in “Whitepaper: Estimating Energy  Consumption & GHG Emissions for Remote Workers” in February 2021, source. b Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are from diesel generators and Santa Clara campus lab solvent usage (e.g., wipe cleaning). a As of FY20, NVIDIA aligns with regulatory definitions of renewable energy at our key locations and, thus, excludes large-scale hydropower,  as appropriate, from our renewables percentage. This has particular relevance for our Santa Clara, CA headquarters. b Water consumption includes water consumed by landscaping and evaporated in a cooling tower for our new headquarters building. c Waste data for corporate headquarters was estimated on a calendar year basis for FY19 and FY20. d We accumulated a large amount of demolition debris as part of our project to construct a new Silicon Valley headquarters building. 92%  was recycled in FY19. NVIDIA swept the annual Institutional  Investor survey for the best executive  teams, ranking first among over 40  semiconductor categories including: We applied the internationally recognized Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  Sustainability Reporting Standards to produce this FY21 CSR Report. This report  has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. Per the GRI Standards, we indicate the location of the required “General  Disclosures” and each of the “Topic-Standard Disclosures” related to our priority  issues (“Management Approach for Material Topics” and selected disclosures).

COVID-19 Spurs Scientific Revolution in Drug Discovery with AI—Rommie Amaro,  Ph.D., who leads a team of biochemists and computer experts at the University  of California at San Diego, combined high performance computing and AI to  provide the clearest view to date of the coronavirus. The resulting simulation was  downloaded more than 4,000 times by global researchers worldwide and was  called “critical for vaccine design” for COVID and future pathogens. The Amaro  Lab’s work won a special Gordon Bell Prize for COVID-19, the equivalent of a  Nobel Prize in the supercomputing community. It’s one example of work around  the world using AI and data analytics, accelerated by NVIDIA Clara Discovery, to  slash the $2 billion in costs and 10-year time span it typically takes to bring a new  drug to market. AI Software Keeps Drivers Safe and Focused on the Road Ahead—Even with  advanced driver assistance systems automating more driving functions, human  drivers must maintain their attention at the wheel and build trust in the AI system. Traditional driver monitoring systems typically don’t understand subtle cues such  as a driver’s cognitive state, behavior, or other activity that indicates whether  they’re ready to take over the driving controls. NVIDIA DRIVE Ix is an open, scalable cockpit software platform that provides  AI functions to enable a full range of in-cabin experiences, including intelligent  visualization with augmented reality and virtual reality, conversational AI, and  interior sensing. At GTC, Educators and Leaders Focus on Equity in AI, Developer Diversity—This  year, we strengthened our support for women and underrepresented developers  and scientists at GTC by providing conference passes to members of professional  organizations supporting women, Black, and Hispanic/Latino developers. Professors at historically Black colleges and universities—including Prairie  View A&M University, Hampton University, and Jackson State University—as  well as groups like  Black in AI and LatinX in AI received complimentary access  to training from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute. And in a collaboration with  the National Society of Black Engineers that will extend beyond GTC, we created  opportunities for the society’s collegiate and professional developers to engage  with NVIDIA’s recruiting team, which provided guidance on navigating the new  world of virtual interviewing and networking. Duckietown Foundation Offering Free Robotics Courses—The Duckietown  project, which started as an MIT class in 2016, has evolved into an open-source  platform for robotics and AI education, research, and outreach. The project is  coordinated by the Duckietown Foundation, whose mission is to reach and teach  a wide audience of students about robotics and AI. The Duckietown Foundation  announced that it’s offering a free edx course on AI and robotics using the  Duckiebot hardware platform powered by the new NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB  Developer kit. Why 20,000+ Developers from Emerging Markets Signed Up for GTC—Our recent  GPU Technology Conference—virtual, free to register, and featuring 24/7 content  —for the first time featured a dedicated track on AI in emerging markets. The  sessions attracted a record 20,000+ developers, industry leaders, policymakers,  and researchers in emerging markets across 95 countries. Dozens of startup  founders from emerging markets shared their innovations. Community leaders,  major tech companies and nonprofits discussed their work to build resources  for developers in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa. And hands-on labs,  training and networking sessions offered opportunities for attendees to boost  their skills and ask questions of AI experts. Three Startups Using Deep Learning for Environmental Monitoring—NVIDIA  Inception is an accelerator program for startups in AI, data science, and HPC that  equips them with fundamental tools to support product development, prototyping,  and deployment. Companies in the NVIDIA Inception program are using aerial  imagery and AI to track global deforestation, monitor thawing permafrost in the  Arctic, and prevent natural gas leaks.

Our technologies are ubiquitous. We estimate more than 99%  of internet data traffic passes through one or more of our  technologies during its journey from start to finish. Life-saving medical equipment such as  ventilators, defibrillators, MRI machines,  PET and CT scanners, infusion pumps and  other drug delivery devices Currently, data centers account for 1% of global power consumption. By 2030, that number is expected to increase to as much as 13%. Networking in data centers accounts for approximately 9% of a data  center’s power consumption and we expect this to continue to grow in  the coming years. In early 2021, we unveiled our product roadmap for co-packaged  optics (CPO) solutions, which include the transceiver CPO, switch  CPO and AI/ML CPO, aimed at addressing next generation  bandwidth and power challenges. Our purpose-built switch CPO  platform combines Broadcom’s leading-edge switch silicon and  optics on the same package substrate to deliver the industry’s  highest power efficiency. Having the switch directly driving the optics  significantly reduces the interconnect power and thereby increases  the system power handling capability. Compared to conventional  discrete solutions, these switch CPO solutions are expected to deliver  30% power consumption savings while providing 40% lower optics  costs per bit. Broadcom is best positioned to lead CPO product development and  help data center operators reduce their power consumption. As the world moves toward green energy systems and away from  fossil fuels, Broadcom’s industrial products continue to help support  these green energy systems. Broadcom optocouplers are used in an array of green applications  ranging from solar and wind inverters, energy storage, automotive  electric vehicles, and charging and power supplies. The popularity of Broadcom optocouplers in these green applications  is due to their ability to drive inverters more efficiently, to reduce  copper losses by providing high insulation voltage and to consume  less power during current sensing and data transmission. For example, Broadcom’s isolated gate drive and optocoupler  products are used in renewable energy storage systems that store  electricity when the demand is low and supply stored electricity  when the demand is high. This improves the energy efficiency of the  power generation system and stabilizes operation of the electricity  grid – both at a utility scale and a home scale. Our reputation for product excellence is built upon the innovation, quality and reliability of our  products. We continue to achieve this by: 
Our Chief Operations Officer reviews quality issues, including customer returns, every month. We expect our employees to provide products that meet legal requirements and are safe for  their intended markets and applications, as outlined by our Broadcom Product Safety and  Regulations Policy. The elimination of hazardous materials from products is a global initiative, with each region  or country imposing its own legislation to eliminate these harmful substances from the  environment. For more information on Broadcom’s efforts, please refer to our Product  Material Environmental Specifications and General Specification for the Environment (GSE). Broadcom offers a broad portfolio of RoHS-compliant products. Rigorous testing  procedures ensure the performance integrity of Broadcom’s portfolio of products,  regardless of the materials and processes employed. Our quality management system and  processes are aligned with the requirements  of ISO 9001, and we choose suppliers with  quality management systems of equal rigor. We expect our suppliers and partners to  comply with our Suppliers & Partners Quality  System Requirements. Certain of our sites  are ISO 9001 certified. For more information,  please refer to our certificates: ISO 9001  Certificate and International Automotive Task  Force (IATF) 16949 Certificate. At Broadcom, we understand that our workforce is the foundation of our success. Having a talented, engaged and diverse workforce makes us a strong, resilient  and innovative company. We are able to recruit and retain our highly skilled  and dedicated workforce due to our workplace culture, which encourages our  employees to push for excellence and innovation, and rewards and supports them  for giving their best. Having highly engaged employees is a key  component to Broadcom’s success. We measure  our employees’ engagement by our voluntary  attrition rate and our Employee Ethical Culture  Survey. Our voluntary attrition rate and responses  to our Employee Ethical Culture Survey help us to  continue to improve and create an environment  that is supportive of our employees and where our  employees feel their contributions are valued. Broadcom’s employment practices and  policies support the fundamental human  rights principles of freely  chosen employment,  non-discrimination, the  elimination of forced  and underage labor  and the rights of  workers to organize  and freely associate,  as articulated in  the International  Labour Organization  Conventions. Our employees are aware of  their rights. We currently have a number  of employees under collective bargaining  agreements in various countries. As part of our commitment to human rights,  we conduct an annual internal human rights  assessment and have found no human   rights concerns. Our global voluntary attrition rate in 2021, which does not include  employees who left as a result of restructuring, divestitures or  terminations for cause, was 6.8%, which is below the technology   industry benchmark (AON, 2021 Salary Increase and Turnover Study —   Second Edition, September 2021). At the end of 2021, Broadcom had approximately 20,000 employees in   29 countries around the world. Our EEO-1 report for our employees in the   U.S. can be found at the Corporate Citizenship webpage on our external  company website. We are proud that many knowledgeable and talented  employees from our acquired companies and businesses,  such as LSI, Brocade, CA and Symantec Enterprise  Security, have decided to join us. It is not always easy to  successfully integrate upon closing an acquisition, and we  do not take this challenge lightly. We take a thoughtful  approach when integrating our acquired companies and  businesses and workforces. Leaders from the acquired companies and businesses  who join us help to ensure that employee morale is  maintained and attrition is limited. Currently, in addition  to Kirsten Spears, our Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie  Kawwas, our Chief Operating Officer, over 40% of our  executives and general managers who lead business units  within Broadcom have joined us through acquisitions. Our CEO, executives and many different groups, such  as Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Global Technology  Organization, Global Operations and Workplace Services,  are actively involved in planning integration and ensuring  a supportive integration upon closing the acquisition. We provide the employees who have decided to join  us with orientation, compliance and product trainings,  and onboarding and transition assistance so that they  can quickly integrate into Broadcom and be part of the  Broadcom team from “day one” of closing the acquisition. Our Broadcom Software Group, under the leadership  of Tom Krause who was previously our Chief Financial  Officer and is now the President of this group, is the  product of our commitment to integration planning and  is an example of how our employees from our acquired  companies and businesses are engaged and working  together to build one of the world’s leading enterprise  software businesses within Broadcom. Broadcom is a multi-national, multi-cultural company that employs  people of many different nationalities, ethnicities, cultures, abilities,  backgrounds, faiths and beliefs. Our goal is to create a welcoming and  inclusive culture, which empowers our workforce to give their best,  collaborate and contribute to our collective success. Our Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Optical Systems  Division and our Vice President and General Manager of our PreAmp  Components Division were the executive sponsors of the Diversity@ Broadcom initiative. The Diversity@Broadcom initiative is also supported  by a steering committee at Broadcom that is comprised of several of  our executives and general managers who report to our CEO and lead  business units at Broadcom. Through the Diversity@Broadcom initiative, we commenced a quarterly  global Leadership Talk series featuring Broadcom executives and other  industry leaders. The purpose of the Leadership Talk series is to provide  a forum for leaders and our employees to share their experiences and  discuss leadership, diversity, equity and inclusion within our industry. We also established through the Diversity@Broadcom initiative Lean  In Circles within Broadcom. The Lean In Circles provide our employees  with peer mentorship and a safe space where they can share their  experiences, build new skills and lead. We have approximately a  dozen Lean In Circles, including LGBT at Broadcom, Neurodiversity  at Work: ASD Allies, Tech Moms Driving Career Growth and Women  in Mainframe IT. We are excited to support this important community  network for our employees and look forward to the program growing  over the coming years. We strive to recruit and hire diverse  candidates and advance qualified women,  minorities, veterans and individuals with  disabilities. We are increasing our efforts  to recruit and retain candidates from  underrepresented communities, including  recruiting on websites focused on diverse  backgrounds and experiences. In 2021, we required our managers to take  unconscious bias training to encourage  awareness of unconscious bias in recruiting  and hiring. In addition, we regularly monitor  our various programs and policies related to  employment decisions and equal opportunity  and we annually assess our affirmative action  programs and policies to identify and address  areas of potential improvement. It is important to Broadcom that we  improve the representation of women and  underrepresented communities in technical  roles in our pipeline of candidates. We partner with the Broadcom Foundation,  a non-profit organization funded from  our subsidiary Broadcom Corporation, to  advance science, technology, engineering  and math (STEM) education for women and  underrepresented youth. Broadcom believes  that cultivating interest in STEM, providing  equitable access to STEM education and  preparing students to be college and  career-ready to succeed in STEM fields is  key to creating the engineers, scientists and  innovators of tomorrow who will ultimately  fill our pipeline of candidates. With annual grants of over $4 million, the  Broadcom Foundation has supported  regional, national and international science  fairs, coding programs and competitions and  after/out-of-school programs for pre-college  students. Our employees also volunteer  their time to mentor, participate in STEM  education programs and judge competitions. Broadcom is committed to improving the  pipeline of women and underrepresented  communities in these technical roles,  particularly in the field of engineering. In 2021, we provided scholarships focused  toward electrical engineering and computer  science students from underrepresented  communities at San Jose State University and  Colorado State University, both of which are  located near several of our larger facilities in  the U.S. In addition, we sponsored scholarships  with the Society of Women Engineers. Broadcom’s success depends on the  continued ability to attract, motivate and  retain our workforce. Competition for  talented employees is significant in many  locations where we operate, such as Silicon  Valley and Southeast Asia. As a result, we provide competitive  compensation and benefit programs to our  employees, including performance-based  compensation (such as our annual cash  bonus program, sales incentive plans and  spot bonuses) and equity awards. Broadcom is different from its peer  companies because a vast majority of  our employees receive equity awards  that vest over time. We grant equity to  our employees because we want our  employees to share in Broadcom’s success. We believe that equity compensation aligns  the interest of our employees with our  stockholders, is a key factor in recruiting and  retaining top talent and assists in the successful  and rapid integration of our employees who  join Broadcom through acquisitions. In 2021, we provided Nurse Triage 24 Hour (NT24) to our  U.S. employees. NT24 is a hotline that is staffed 24 hours  a day and 365 days out of the year by highly-trained  registered nurses. NT24 gives our U.S. employees access to immediate  medical guidance for non-emergency work-related  injuries or illnesses. NT24’s registered nurses help  determine the level of care required, and our U.S.  employees are guided through self-care or referred to a  medical provider if treatment beyond self-care is needed. As part of our effort to ensure  employee equality and pay equity, in  2021 we engaged a third-party firm  to conduct a pay equity evaluation  focusing on subsets of our global  population, including the U.S.  
After accounting for factors such as job  and location, this evaluation revealed  that, on average, pay was equitable for  employees in the same job doing the  same work when comparing women  to men globally, or when comparing  Asian, Black/African American, or  Hispanic/Latinx to White/Caucasian  employees in the U.S. In 2021, we were able to return to the office and maintain  on-site operations during COVID-19 because we took  numerous additional proactive measures to protect and  invest in the health and well-being of our employees. We proactively consulted with third-party certified  industrial hygienists and epidemiologists in adopting  additional protective measures on top of complying with  government mandated safety protocols and industry  standards. Please see the Health and Safety During  COVID-19 section for more information about our  COVID-19 safety actions. We offer a range of benefits to our employees beyond  the traditional healthcare benefits and insurance. Our U.S.  benefits include: 
To help reduce stress and encourage mindfulness, we  provide wellness and prayer/meditation rooms. We  also subsidize our on-site cafeterias that feature healthy  dietary options, including vegetarian and halal options  where available. We provide structured, job-specific technical training and testing  for our manufacturing and operational employees. We also provide  numerous technical product trainings to our sales personnel. Each business unit has the ability to establish its own training and  development programs, including intern and mentorship programs. For example, employees in our Agile Operations Division (AOD) have  the opportunity to participate in knowledge sharing events, mentoring  programs and a variety of learning communities. In addition, AOD  invests in our current and future leaders through an extensive leadership  program — Unleashing Your Leadership Potential — that provides them  with the tools and experience to drive real business results. Throughout the year, all of our employees (including part-time employees)  and contractors are required to complete trainings that support  Broadcom’s values and culture, such as our Code of Ethics and Business  Conduct, harassment prevention, anti-corruption, protection of confidential  information, data privacy and security, unconscious bias, human rights,  anti-competition prevention and export compliance trainings. In 2021, our employees and contractors completed a total  of over 170,000 assigned learning hours, including over  30,000 assigned learning hours of technical training. Our managers have multiple opportunities throughout the year to  provide performance feedback to their team members, including  feedback on career and skill development. Our review and decisions  on annual salary, bonuses, equity award grants and promotions occur  in different quarters throughout the year, and at each of those times  managers are required to evaluate their team members’ performance  and provide them feedback. Our Educational Assistance program is available to all employees  (including part-time employees) and provides them with financial  assistance to take academic classes or relevant degree programs that  are work-related and provide knowledge and skills to enhance their  job performance. Maintaining a safe and healthy work environment is important for the  well-being and productivity of our employees. We continue to make strides in engaging our employees to design  and implement safe work processes that eliminate hazards and reduce  occupational health and safety (OHS) risks in our operations. Our Employee Health and Safety (EHS) management system and  processes apply to all of our facilities globally, and we maintain third  party ISO 14001 certification at certain sites. To drive EHS compliance  across Broadcom facilities, we assign site coordinators and develop and  implement site-specific EHS Compliance Plans that consider local OHS  risks in our operations, the environment and legal requirements. EHS  Compliance Plan implementation is tracked and regularly reported to  senior management. In 2021, we updated our Occupational Health & Safety Policy to better  align with international and Singapore OHS management system  standards (ISO 45001:2018 and SS 651:2019). Our EHS intranet site provides information to our employees, including  COVID-19 pandemic information, emergency action plans, work- related injury reporting systems, EHS Compliance Plans and other EHS  programs, procedures and guidelines. We also provide self-paced online EHS training courses to help our employees  understand their responsibilities and the resources available to them. In 2021, we implemented processes for reporting occupational injuries and illnesses  so global rates could be more consistently managed and tracked. Once reported, we  conduct an incident investigation and root cause analysis, as needed, to determine  appropriate corrective and preventive actions. Our semiconductor manufacturing and laboratory operations represent our most  significant health and safety risks, due to higher potential exposure to chemicals and  machinery-related hazards at such sites. Continued focus on managing and reducing these risks has helped us maintain U.S.  occupational injury and illness lost-time case rates significantly below the U.S. Bureau  of Labor Statistics (BLS) occupational injury and illness incidence rate averages for the  semiconductors, computer system design and software publishers industries in which  we operate over the last five years. In 2021, we had 22 recordable cases and 11 lost workday cases representing a total of  347 lost workdays globally. In 2021, our global total injury and illness case rate was 0.11 cases per 100 employees,  and our lost workday case rate was 0.05 cases per 100 employees. There were no  work-related fatalities globally in 2021. Since March 2018, our Fort Collins  manufacturing facility has partnered with  UCHealth to provide our employees with  access to medical care through an on-site  health clinic. The clinic is open during hours that overlap  all employee shifts and is staffed by a  Physician Assistant and a Medical Assistant,  who can provide both personal primary care  and occupational surveillance and treatment. Since September 2020, the clinic has had  almost 2,500 visits, involving a range of  services such as workers compensation  injury/illness evaluation, treatment and  medical surveillance, such as audiograms,  pulmonary function testing, respirator  clearance and mask fitting. The clinic also provides personal primary  care such as immunizations, blood draws,  rapid diagnostic testing and drop-in vital  sign measurements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the on- site clinician has been an active participant  of Broadcom’s COVID-19 mitigation team  to help maintain a healthy workplace and  enable continuous facility operations by  communicating with each employee who  reported COVID-19 symptoms or exposure,  giving them testing and treatment  guidance and clearing them to return to  work per Broadcom’s COVID-19 Mitigation  Policy guidelines. During 2021, we continued to focus on keeping our employees and  contractors safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. •  Provided masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and disinfecting cleaning  supplies for all on-site personnel, and mandated that personnel  wear masks on site 
• Required thermal scanning cameras and infrared contactless  thermometers at all locations upon entry and exit 
• Implemented rotating shifts, reconfigured work spaces and  revised seating assignments to reduce employee density in our  facilities and promote social distancing 
• Significantly enhanced cleaning protocols, including frequent  intraday sanitization of high contact common areas and surfaces  and daily electrostatic disinfection of common areas and  conference rooms in many of our locations 
• Deployed portable HEPA filtration units for conference rooms  and limited the number of people permitted in a conference  room at a time 
• Provided mental health support to our employees through our  EAP, various health insurance provider sponsored initiatives and  meditation workshops 
As vaccines became available in 2021, we provided our employees  and contractors with information about how they could obtain the  vaccines with the goal of keeping our employees, contractors and  their family members safe. We provided 23 free on-site vaccination clinics for our employees,  contractors and their dependents at 16 Broadcom sites in the U.S.  and India. We also rolled out mega vaccination drives in India for  more than 3,500 employees, contractors and their dependents  over three months and in Malaysia for more than 1,000 employees  and contractors over two months. We are committed to supporting ethical business conduct, respecting human rights and responsibly  sourcing materials throughout our global supply chain. We outsource most of our manufacturing  and strive to work with responsible supply chain partners that are leaders in the industry. Our Supplier Environmental and Social  Responsibility Code of Conduct (Supplier  Code), which we updated in 2021 to reflect  the RBA Code of Conduct, is the foundation  of our responsible sourcing practices. Our  Supplier Code establishes our expectations  regarding workplace standards and business  practices for our suppliers—including with  respect to labor and human rights, health and  safety, the environment and anti-corruption. In addition to our Supplier Code, our  Conflict Minerals Policy, supplier onboarding  procedures and contract and purchase  order terms establish the standards and  expectations for our suppliers regarding  human rights and other ESG-related issues. We comply with the U.S. federal  government’s requirements for government  contractors, as set forth in our internal  Broadcom Combating Trafficking in Persons  Compliance Plan. We also publish an annual Statement Against  Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, in  compliance with the California Transparency  in Supply Chains Act, the U.K. Modern Slavery  Act and the Australian Modern Slavery Act. In addition to the supplier human rights  survey, our Global Operations and Internal  Audit teams regularly audit our suppliers to  evaluate their operations and compliance  with various Broadcom and human rights- related requirements, including compliance  with wage and hour labor laws, safe and  respectful working conditions, written  employment agreements and prohibitions  on charging workers recruitment fees. While  these audits are typically on-site audits at the  supplier location, we adjusted and primarily  conducted our audits remotely in 2021 due   to the COVID-19 pandemic. We seek to source goods and services from  minority-owned, woman-owned, historically  underutilized businesses, veteran-owned,  service-disabled veteran-owned, small and  disadvantaged businesses that are able to  provide quality goods and services in a   timely and competitive manner. We also  include women- and minority-owned firms   in our corporate debt financing syndicates. We are committed to upholding  RBA’s vision of a global  electronics industry that creates  sustainable value for workers,  the environment and business. Although we primarily outsource our manufacturing, we regularly engage with our  suppliers and we are working to improve our multi-tier supply chain visibility. program to screen for human rights  issues, which includes over 90% of  our current supply chain suppliers  (based on our 2020 supplier spend) 
expectations communication to  reinforce our commitment to a  responsible supply chain and provide  suppliers with information on our  supply chain human rights program,  including our updated Supplier Code  and access to training 
raised in our 2020 supplier human  rights survey—specifically four  suppliers who used fines to discipline  workers and one supplier who did not  permit collective bargaining no longer  engage in these prohibited practices 
We identified and surveyed our  largest suppliers globally (based  on 2020 supplier spend data) that  were not part of our 2020 supplier  human rights survey. These suppliers,  collectively with the suppliers  surveyed in 2020, represent over  90% of our supply chain (based on  our 2020 supplier spend). We found no instances of forced  labor, child labor, slavery or human  trafficking among Broadcom’s  suppliers. However, we identified one  supplier, who is located in Europe,  who may use fines as a method of  discipline for its workers. While this  practice is legal in the jurisdiction  and the supplier has a well-defined  written escalating disciplinary  process supported by the local trade  union, we have actively engaged with  this supplier and requested that it  discontinues this practice. In 2021, as part of our ongoing efforts to educate and raise awareness of  forced labor and human trafficking issues, we required human rights awareness  and forced labor prevention training for relevant employees in our Global  Operations, HR, Legal, Procurement and supply chain functions who have a  direct responsibility for supply chain management. Our employees working  with our U.S. government customers participate in combating trafficking in  persons training and prevention of forced labor training on an annual basis. We  achieved a 100% completion rate for both of these trainings in 2021. We are committed to socially responsible sourcing of conflict minerals (cassiterite,  columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite, and/or their derivatives tin, tantalum and  tungsten) included in our products. We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), and leverage RMI’s  resources to conduct our conflict minerals supply chain due diligence, including  using RMI’s database of suppliers that are listed on the Responsible Minerals  Assurance Process (RMAP) Conformant Smelter List. We strongly support our  industry’s efforts to expand the smelter certification program and the audit process. We continued our annual due diligence of our supply chain for the use  of conflict minerals in the design and manufacturing of our products in  conjunction with our annual SEC reporting. Due to the nature of our supply  chain where we outsource most of our manufacturing, we do not typically  have a direct relationship with the smelters and refiners (SORs). In 2020, 95% (245 out of 259) of the active SORs potentially in our supply  chain were certified “conflict free” under the RMAP audit process. This high  level of conformance is due to our on-going efforts to identify conflict minerals  risks in our supply chain and encourage our suppliers to purchase materials  only from SORs that are certified as “conflict free” in compliance with RMAP  protocols. For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Policy and our   2020 Conflict Minerals Report. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021,  we experienced some disruption in our supply  chain when facilities of our key suppliers and  service providers were impacted or operated  with limited resources and workers. In response,  we worked closely with our supply chain to  safeguard their workers’ health and ensure  continued supply of products and services. As we enter into 2022, we are also facing  supply challenges. Similar to the way we  responded to COVID-19, we will continue to  monitor and engage our supply chain to ensure  human rights are protected while focusing on  business continuity. At Broadcom, cybersecurity and data privacy form a core part of our corporate mission and are critical to protecting our customers, company  and the broader digital ecosystem. Our Chief Information Officer provides quarterly updates on cybersecurity risks to the Audit Committee and  annually reports to the Board on our cybersecurity risks and initiatives. Our Symantec cybersecurity solutions strengthen the defenses of  global institutions against organized crime syndicates operating  online. In addition to providing the latest technical countermeasures  against cyber threats, we frequently collaborate with law enforcement  agencies and other partners around the world to help neutralize  transnational cyber-threats. Our technical expertise and unique visibility into threat actors’  tactics have helped authorities break up cyber-crime networks and  successfully prosecute or disrupt criminal offenders worldwide,  including actors responsible for prolific Trojans, ransomware,  distributed-denial-of-service campaigns and crypto-mining hijacks. Our commitment to cybersecurity is also reflected in our support for  victims of computer fraud and abuse in their pursuit of civil remedies  to disrupt or seize control of malicious infrastructure. We want to ensure our commercial cybersecurity technologies,  and the research activities that support them, are deployed and  conducted responsibly and ethically. Our Cyber Social Responsibility  Policy imposes guardrails on our collection and sharing of cyber  threat intelligence and includes controls designed to prevent the  misuse of our security technologies. We strive to incorporate cybersecurity and privacy into the full  lifecycle of our products and to be transparent with our customers  and other stakeholders about our cybersecurity and privacy policies  and practices. We maintain a privacy portal on our corporate website  that includes our privacy policies, standard contractual clauses  for international data transfers and product-specific transparency  statements that disclose categories of data collection and processing,  the identities and locations of sub-processors and privacy-enhancing  product features. In 2021, we completed a comprehensive mapping of our international  data flows in anticipation of the new EU Standard Contractual  Clauses. We also took steps to assess and prepare for the emergence  of new regulatory requirements on critical infrastructure and supply  chain security in sectors that we serve. In 2021, Broadcom was selected to join the Joint Cyber  Defense Collaborative (JCDC). The JCDC is a joint  collaboration between federal agencies and the private  sector led by the Cyber Security and Infrastructure  Security Agency (CISA) to strengthen U.S. cyber defenses  through planning, preparation and information sharing. As a member of the JCDC, we are proud to help lead the  development of cyber defense plans to protect our nation  against cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. As a part of our own enterprise security program, we maintain  a comprehensive portfolio of information security management  system policies designed around the ISO/IEC 27001 standards,  and we maintain an ISO 27001:2013 certification for the Customer  Support infrastructure of our software businesses. Our cloud-based Software-as-a-Service solutions also undergo  routine audits for compliance with applicable security-controls  standards such as the American Institute of CPAs’ Trust Services  Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality  and Privacy (SOC 2) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security  Standard (PCI-DSS). We conduct third-party penetration testing of our corporate  and customer-facing networks at least annually and routinely  scan servers, applications, endpoints and network devices for  vulnerabilities. All issues identified as critical, high or medium risks  are remediated in a timely manner. In 2021, as high-profile cyber-attacks targeted  parts of the global information technology supply  chain, we undertook a comprehensive review of  our “digital assurance” practices, including an  analysis of the security and privacy aspects of  
our own software development operations. This resulted in an  updated corporate Secure Software Development Policy,  which mandates use of security- and privacy-by-design  principles throughout the software development lifecycle. Due to an increase in high-profile  cyber-attacks and employees  working from home during the  COVID-19 pandemic, we enhanced  our employees’ awareness and  knowledge of security and privacy issues by:  
tabletop exercise for our employees responsible  for our data security to stress-test our incident- response procedures and response time that  required global, cross-functional participation  from our employees in our Global Technology  Organization, Broadcom Software Group, Legal,  Human Resources and Corporate Marketing 
Month campaign in October, including providing  additional guidance and resources, such as  real-life phishing examples and best practices in  cybersecurity and privacy We have a dedicated privacy group that reports to the Chief  Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer and oversees all aspects of  our corporate privacy program. We also have an internal privacy  working group that consists of global, cross-functional employees  from our Global Technology Organization, Legal and business units  and works to promote a uniform and coordinated approach to  various privacy challenges. We log and track cybersecurity and privacy matters from  emergence to resolution, including data subject access requests,  data processor risk management, privacy impact assessments,  records of processing activities, incident response activities and  other privacy compliance issues. We also actively engage in matters related to data governance by  responding to regulatory consultations and providing public policy  feedback based on our real-life experiences across the regions  where we do business. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have tried to balance the  need to manage information that would enable us to effectively  protect our workforce and provide a safe work environment with the  need to maintain privacy of personal information and especially health- related information as required by applicable law in each jurisdiction. We worked cross-functionally with different business stakeholders to  provide innovative solutions that would enable employees to enter the  office safely, maintain social distancing and where permissible, assist  contact tracing efforts. At Broadcom, we seek to manage our business in a sustainable manner that  considers the impact of both our direct operations and supply chain on the  planet. We strive to continuously improve our operations by managing resources  effectively and finding innovative ways to produce our products more efficiently. Our semiconductor business primarily operates through a fabless production  model where we outsource the vast majority of the manufacturing of our  semiconductor products to trusted third-party suppliers and foundries. Managing our environmental impact allows us to be prepared for climate- related risks and capitalize on climate-related opportunities, making  Broadcom more resilient to climate change while allowing us to increase  operational performance and reduce costs. We leveraged the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to communicate our approach to  addressing climate-related risks and opportunities through governance,  strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. We follow an integrated approach to addressing climate change, and  multiple personnel from our Global Operations, Workplace Services,  manufacturing and product division groups are responsible for managing  climate-related activities, initiatives and policies. Our senior executives and  our NESG Committee and Audit Committee review climate-related risks and  opportunities and related strategies on an annual basis. We describe our overall risk management processes in our 2022 Proxy  Statement, and we describe our climate-related risks and opportunities within  this report and in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
A more detailed mapping of our climate disclosures aligned with the  recommendations of the TCFD and SASB framework (Semiconductors and  Software & IT Industry Standards) is included in the Appendix. At Broadcom, we understand  that climate change poses an  immense challenge for society  and that a collective effort is  required to effectively mitigate  the impacts. In preparation for our next ESG Report to be  published in 2023, we are currently conducting  an evaluation of Scope 3 greenhouse gases  (GHG) emissions categories to assess which  categories are relevant to our business and  where we can start collecting and reporting  Scope 3 emissions data in the future. Energy and water use, GHG emissions and  waste generation represent Broadcom’s  priority environmental impact areas, both  directly at our proprietary manufacturing  locations and indirectly through our outsourced  manufacturing activities. To help us manage these impacts, we employ  robust environmental management practices  and have implemented a global Environment  and Sustainability Policy, which requires that we: 
environmental management system that  strives to align with our business practices and  set objectives that enhance environmental  performance 
Our environmental management system, which  serves as a framework for our global operations,  is aligned with International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) 14001 and guides  our efforts in achieving the expectations set  forth by our Environment and Sustainability  Policy. Additionally, we track and review our  environmental data, such as energy and  GHG emissions, water usage and waste  generated, and we look for ways to improve our  environmental performance over time. Our head  of Workplace Services, who is responsible for  our environmental management system, reports  directly to our CEO. In our 2020 ESG Report, we reported our  energy, emissions and water data for our U.S.  operations. In this report, we expanded our  reporting to include this data from our global  operations. We have also increased our efforts  to collect and analyze waste data from our  global facilities, and this report includes waste  data from our owned facilities and hazardous  waste data from our Workplace Services- managed manufacturing facilities. Since 2006, our Singapore  and Charlotte, North Carolina  manufacturing facilities and our  office in Penang, Malaysia have  achieved ISO 14001 certification for  environmental management. This rigorous international  certification is focused on  continuous improvement to increase  efficiency in the use of resources,  prevent negative environmental  impacts and build awareness  among employees in reducing their  environmental footprint. Our Fort Collins, Colorado facility is our largest manufacturing  facility and we are proud that it has been recognized as a Gold  Environmental Leader by the Colorado Department of Public Health  & Environment since 2010 and is a Platinum ClimateWise Member in  the City of Fort Collins Sustainability Partnership since 2000. As a Gold Environmental Leader, our Fort Collins manufacturing  facility demonstrated a fully operational, facility-specific  Environmental Management System (EMS) that goes beyond  compliance requirements. The goal of the ClimateWise program is to  reduce carbon emissions through voluntary business engagement  and sustainable business practices. In order to drive operational improvement, our Fort Collins  manufacturing facility routinely reviews the efficiency of equipment,  technologies and processes, and looks for ways to reduce our energy  consumption and emissions. We have many on-going long-term  efficiency improvement and emission reduction projects at our Fort  Collins manufacturing facility, such as: 
expected to result in a 14% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  at our Fort Collins manufacturing facility 
We recognize that climate change is creating serious issues for the  Colorado and western U.S. regions. Our Fort Collins manufacturing  facility has installed improved outside air filtration to overcome increased  particles in the air from what has become near continuous summer  wildfires and other particles, such as dust from winds and dry soil due  to drought. We have also optimized HVAC systems through incoming  air damper adjustments, increased use of carbon filters for odor  reduction and introduced high efficiency pre-filters to minimize outside  particulates from entering into the office space and manufacturing areas. We continue to be concerned about reduced snowpack and lower  amounts of rainfall and their impacts on our operations. To date  the Fort Collins manufacturing facility has had no interruptions to  operations due to water shortages, however we continue to implement  water savings programs to help lessen demand on the water shed. We actively monitor and collect data on the electricity and fuel  we consume in our facilities, as well as process gases including  perfluorocarbon (PFC) used in tooling, which are the primary drivers  of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. For this report, we calculated GHG emissions associated with  our electricity, natural gas, fuel, refrigerant, PFC and process gas  consumption/loss for both office and manufacturing facilities  globally. PFCs and process gases are required for certain tools  in the semiconductor manufacturing process, including CVD  chamber cleaning and etching equipment. Semiconductor  manufacturing processes also use fluorinated compounds including  perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, nitrogen trifluoride and  sulfur hexafluoride as well as fluorinated heat transfer fluids and  nitrous oxide. Electricity usage at our facilities accounts for approximately 71%  of our total energy consumption and approximately 56% of our  overall Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) GHG emissions. Our second  largest source of GHG emissions are PFCs and process gases, which  are used in processing equipment at our manufacturing facilities,  and account for approximately 34% of our overall Scope 1 and 2  (location-based) GHG emissions. For U.S. facilities, we reduced total energy consumption by 7.3% and  total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 3.6% in  2021 compared to 2020. To drive operational improvement, we routinely review the efficiency  of our equipment, technologies, and processes, and look for ways  to reduce our energy consumption and emissions. We have many  on-going long-term efficiency improvement and emission reduction  projects throughout our global facilities. (VFD) control panel for one of their buildings in July 2021. VFDs  are used to control the speed of alternating current (AC) motors  by varying the frequency supplied to the motor, therefore limiting  the amount of electricity usage in the building. This project is  estimated to save up to 120,000 kWh of electricity or reduce  emissions by 90 tCO2e annually. kWh of energy per year and reduce emissions by 44 tCO2e  from the replacement of several units of florescent lamps with  LEDs and through the installation of an inverter control for the  building’s chiller. area lighting, an initiative that saves up to 8,400 kWh of electricity  and reduces emissions by 5 tCO2e per year. converting ten pumps from wet to dry, a transition that saves  50,000 kWh of energy annually, reduces emissions by 16 tCO2e  per year and reduces the consumption of hydrocarbon and  Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based oils by 95%. For all environmental metrics, we apply  an operational control boundary. We  used the methodology outlined in the  World Resource Institute (WRI) and the  World Business Council for Sustainable  Development’s (WBCSD) GHG Protocol:  A Corporate Accounting and Reporting  Standard (Revised Edition) and WRI/ WBSCD GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance  – an amendment to the GHG Protocol  Corporate Standard to calculate Scope 1  and 2 emissions generated by our global  facilities. Through this assessment, we measured  the GHG emissions associated with  natural gas, diesel fuels, kerosene and  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) we utilize  for heating and cooling our facilities and  for our backup generators, as well as  the refrigerants and PFCs used in our  manufacturing, offices and equipment  over which we have operational control. In  addition, we measured the electricity we  purchase to power our facilities (Scope 2  location-based method). GHG emissions  are reported in metric tonnes of CO2e  (tCO2e). Our energy consumption is  limited to natural gas, diesel, kerosene, LPG  and electricity use. We calculate energy  and emissions based on actual data when  available. When actual consumption data is  not available, we estimate utilizing square  footage intensity factors by facility type. The following tables summarize our fuel and energy consumption and our GHG emissions  for global facilities in 2021, as well as for facilities in the U.S. for both 2020 and 2021. (1)  Historical data and associated Scope 1 emissions have been restated due to improvements in data collection methodologies.

Scope 2 market-based method. Emission factors used in Scope 2 market-based calculations include Association of Issuing Bodies: European Residual  Mixes 2019 (August 2020) and applicable factors used in the location-based method. We recognize that water scarcity and quality are challenges that  many communities encounter around the world, and we strive to  use water responsibly in our operations. Semiconductor manufacturing uses a significant amount of  water. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing model,  with over 85% of our wafer manufacturing performed by third- party foundries. We also outsource the substantial majority of  our assembly and test operations to third parties. Our contract  manufacturers and other suppliers are expected to abide by  our Supplier Code. In 2021, we calculated water withdrawals  associated with our global offices and manufacturing facilities. We regularly monitor our own water use at facilities where we  have operational control and make efforts to conserve and use  it efficiently in our facilities. Water is monitored and managed  locally, and we have implemented various technologies to reduce  water consumption. At facilities in the U.S., these efforts resulted  in water reduction of over 8%, or nearly 44 million gallons, in  2021 compared to 2020. In the U.S., our Fort Collins manufacturing facility is the primary  driver of our water consumption. We actively monitor our water  consumption and evaluate our water efficiency efforts at this  manufacturing facility. We have invested, and continue to invest,  in substantial improvements to conserve, recycle and reclaim  water used at our Fort Collins manufacturing facility, including  the installation in 2021 of a water reuse system that is expected  to save an additional 18 million gallons of water each year. Outside of the U.S., our Singapore manufacturing facility is the  largest user of water. This location is ISO 14001 certified and has  implemented a number of initiatives to drive efficiency across  the facility. (1)  We calculated water withdrawals based on actual data where available. Where actual data is not available, we We monitor our waste byproducts and generation as part of our overall  environmental impact management at facilities where we have operational  control, and our facilities around the world are focused on reducing waste and  diverting waste from the landfill. For example, our Fort Collins facility diverted  381,500 pounds of waste from landfill as part of site remodel work and donated  25 integrated circuit manufacturing tools to various local organizations. In 2021, we began a process to aggregate our waste data, which has  historically been managed at the local facility level, including waste and  diversion data across our globally owned facilities. We are also actively  monitoring hazardous waste and industrial process waste streams at our  global manufacturing facilities. In 2021, our Workplace Services-managed  manufacturing facilities diverted nearly 98% of all hazardous waste from  landfill through on-site reuse, recycling, incineration or other means. (2)  Hazardous and industrial process waste data is based on reported data from 100% of Broadcom’s global Workplace Services- 
Currently, we partner with a  third-party service provider  to decommission and recycle  all of our U.S. e-waste, as  required by local regulations. In 2021, we recycled nearly   86 metric tons (190,000 lbs) of e-waste  from our owned facilities globally. To celebrate Earth Day in 2021, Broadcom  sponsored an employee e-waste recycling  initiative at some of our largest U.S. sites. Approximately 11 metric tons (over 24,250 lbs)  of e-waste were collected. To promote environmental sustainability, our  Global Operations team set an ambitious goal  of reusing or recycling 30% of the packing  materials used at our warehouse in Malaysia. Since the beginning of this project in May 2020,  we have been able to reuse over 102,000  cardboard boxes, saving approximately 2,100  trees. This initiative not  only helps reduce our  environmental impact  but has also saved us  approximately $130,000  per year in operating  expenses. We are committed to conducting business with integrity and maintaining the  highest standards of business conduct and ethics. Our corporate governance  framework is designed for accountability of our Board and management and  transparency to our employees, stockholders and other stakeholders. Our Board is led by Chairman Henry Samueli, Ph.D. and Lead Independent  Director Eddy Hartenstein. Broadcom’s Board is comprised of nine members. Seven of our nine directors are deemed to be independent. Three of  our directors are women, and four of our directors are considered to be  underrepresented minorities (pursuant to the Nasdaq Stock Market’s listing  standards). Recognizing the increased importance of corporate social responsibility and  sustainability for Broadcom’s continued business success, our Board changed  the name of the “Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee” to  the “Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee” (NESG  Committee) in February 2021. Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that cover various  topics relating to the Board and its responsibilities, such as composition,  overboarding, succession, performance evaluations and operations. One of the Board’s responsibilities is evaluating Broadcom’s business risks,  including climate-related risks and opportunities and cybersecurity risks,  and enterprise risk management practices. Our senior management team  regularly reviews and discusses with the Board these risks and enterprise  risk management, the measures in place to address these risks and the  effectiveness of those measures. The foundation of our corporate governance framework is our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the Code) and Anti-Bribery and Anti- Corruption Policy. It is important to Broadcom that our employees, officers, directors and contractors understand and comply with our Code and  Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. Our Code guides our employees, officers, directors and contractors  in how we conduct our business and work with each other. Our Code  reflects our values, standards and expectations. Complying with the  Code is a condition of continued employment or engagement with  Broadcom. We require our employees to annually certify that they  have read and understand the Code. Our Code is translated into the  following local languages: Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian,  Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. Our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, who is our Compliance  Officer, actively monitors and audits compliance with the Code under  the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit,  with our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, reports to the Audit  Committee at each quarterly meeting alleged violations of the Code  and actions taken under the Code. In 2021, we launched our Global Compliance Ambassador program  to strengthen our compliance culture. Our leaders from Legal and  Finance at our local global offices were chosen to be our compliance  ambassadors to represent our Compliance Team at those offices. Our Compliance Team has standing meetings with our compliance  ambassadors, partners with them in reviewing trainings and updates  them when there are new developments in local law or publicly- disclosed real-life cases that would be helpful to them and our  employees to understand our compliance culture and policies. Our Compliance Team also contributes to Broadcom’s quarterly  newsletter that is sent to all employees globally. Through the  newsletter, our Compliance Team updates our employees on  upcoming trainings and encourages them to speak-up if they see  questionable behavior or possible misconduct. Our Compliance Team developed a compliance “toolkit” for our  managers because they are responsible for overseeing compliance  of our policies by the personnel they manage. The “toolkit” provides  additional support and information to managers, including useful links  to our policies and resources like compliance videos and slides, as  well as information on how to encourage a culture of compliance and  manage situations when employees report compliance issues to them. If our employees become aware of a potential violation of the Code,  other Broadcom policies or applicable laws, it is their responsibility to  report it to their manager, Human Resources or the Compliance Officer. We provide a number of avenues to contact our Compliance Team,  our Compliance Officer and the Audit Committee to report concerns  or potential violations of the Code, other Broadcom policies, human  rights or applicable laws, including our hotline that is available in  multiple languages and is hosted by an external firm not associated  with Broadcom. This external hotline is available via telephone and  online, and employees, contractors and any other third party can  report concerns anonymously (where permitted by local law). In 2021,  we received inquiries on a range of topics such as human resource  matters, conflicts of interest concerns and allegations of misconduct. We take concerns and allegations related to the Code, other  Broadcom policies or applicable law seriously. We address them  promptly, investigate to the extent necessary and take disciplinary  actions as appropriate (which may include senior management  discussions, employee communications, process and controls  improvements and individual corrective action measures). The Audit Committee receives information on every allegation  submitted via our external hotline, as well as reports and updates on  investigations that are in progress or completed. In 2021, we conducted our annual Employee Ethical Culture  Survey with an external firm to better understand our employees’  engagement in and perception of our compliance culture and to find  areas where we can continuously improve our compliance culture. Through this survey, we learned that our employees are aware of  our compliance program and have confidence in and trust our  management. We again scored above the external firm’s company  peer group benchmark in all categories that were surveyed in 2021. We strive to create an environment where employees  can speak openly about our business practices, including  ESG-related matters, and we encourage our employees to  ask questions and raise concerns. We have an Open Door  Policy and make it very clear that retaliation for raising a  concern in good faith or reporting questionable behavior  or possible misconduct in good faith is prohibited. We prohibit our directors, officers, employees  and anyone acting on our behalf from engaging  in corruption and bribery. Our Anti-Bribery and  Anti-Corruption Policy is summarized in our Code,  including the rules and procedures for providing  or accepting gifts, meals and entertainment. Our  Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer oversees  our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. Similar to the Code, we require our employees  to annually certify that they have read and  understand the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption  Policy and to complete a refresher training. Internal Audit, with our Compliance Team,  regularly assess our operations for corruption  risks, including conducting audits of our  distributors and resellers. Our Compliance  Team conducts anti-corruption diligence on our  new suppliers, distributors and resellers before  onboarding them and companies and businesses  before we acquire them. In addition, our  Compliance Team and Internal Audit work with an  external firm to biennially review our anti-bribery  and anti-corruption compliance program. The  results and recommendations from the biennial  review are discussed with the Audit Committee  and reported to the Board. We require our employees and contractors  to complete annual trainings that support  Broadcom’s values and culture, including our Code,  harassment prevention, anti-bribery and anti- corruption, protection of confidential information,  data privacy and security, unconscious bias, human  rights, insider trading prevention, anti-competition  prevention and export compliance trainings. We  also require our employee and contractors to  certify that they understand and agree to abide by  our Broadcom policies on these topics when they  complete their trainings. Our Compliance Team provides our employees  located in certain regions and working in certain  business groups with additional customized in- person or video-conference trainings on specific  topics such as anti-corruption, anti-competition  prevention and conflicts of interest. In addition, we provide live and online anti- corruption and compliance trainings to our  partners, distributors and resellers worldwide. Our Compliance Team evaluates annually the  compliance trainings and makes appropriate  adjustments based on feedback from our  employees to provide the most relevant trainings. As part of our mission of connecting everything, we engage  with and support the local communities where we work and  live. We are proud to support causes that are important to our  employees and their communities and that promote educational  opportunities in the STEM fields to help develop the next  generation of engineers. In 2021, we increased our employee charitable matching program  by tripling the per employee matching limit, allowing us to match  over $1.1 million in donations made by our employees to charities  and non-profit organizations around the world for the 2021  calendar year. Employees in our Global Technology  Organization have helped hundreds of  students (while simultaneously reducing  our environmental impact) by refurbishing  
and donating corporate laptops to educational non-profit  organizations and schools. Since 2018, we have donated over  3,400 laptop computers around the globe. In 2021, Broadcom was honored to receive the Champion of  Change award from Think Together for our work donating  these laptops to help support learning programs for the youth,  including students experiencing homelessness or in foster care  and children of essential workers across California. We are proud to be a supporter of  not-for-profit organizations in the United  States that combat hunger and poverty.

STRATEGY: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning where such  information is material 
Broadcom has not identified any inherent climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or  strategic impact on our business in the short, medium or long-term. Potential physical risks in our supply chain are  considered and integrated into our Global Operations Business Continuity Plans. In addition, our response to the  COVID-19 pandemic has shown our resilience to potential physical risks to our operations, including our employees’  ability to work remotely if needed. Our company risk-factors are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
development and innovation has the potential to increase revenues through higher demand for Broadcom’s products  and access to new and emerging markets. Broadcom, through our holistic and innovative design and development  process, is continuing to meet the increased requirements for high performance and low power products. For  example:  
Tomahawk 4 switch silicon and optics on the same package substrate, aimed at addressing next generation  bandwidth and power challenges. Broadcom’s purpose-built CPO platform delivers the industry’s highest power  efficiency - having the switch directly driving the optics significantly reduces the interconnect power and thereby  increases the system power handling capability. Compared to conventional discrete solutions, these switch CPO  solutions are expected to consume 30% less power while providing 40% lower optics costs per bit. continue to help support these green energy systems. Broadcom provides a wide range of industrial fiber optic  transceiver, isolated gate driver, isolation amplifier and digital optocoupler products, which are used in wind  turbines and solar energy systems. These products support various functions inside these green energy systems,  including power conversion, electrical current/voltage sensing, battery bank charging and system control and status  communications. •  Resource Efficiency – Broadcom strives to use our resources in the most efficient manner possible. Broadcom has  
implemented a number of projects across the company, which have the effect of reducing our environmental impact  and increasing our resource efficiency. These efficiencies, including energy and water usage efficiencies, result in  reduced operating costs. We will continue to look for ways to further increase our operating efficiency, while reducing  our environmental impact. c) Describe the resilience of  the organization’s strategy,  taking into consideration  different climate-related  scenarios, including under a  2°C or lower scenario 
Broadcom has not conducted a formal scenario analysis, but will continue to assess approaches for incorporating  climate scenario analysis into our existing risk and opportunity assessment processes. c) Describe how processes  for identifying, assessing,  and managing climate- related risks are integrated  into the organization’s  overall risk management 
As part of Broadcom’s enterprise risk management processes, various risks are assessed across the company by  the relevant stakeholders and in collaboration with our Internal Audit Team, as needed. Actual and potential risks,  including the risk factors in our periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are reviewed  by management and the Audit Committee at least quarterly. Updates for select risks are also provided to the Audit  Committee throughout the year. In addition, on an annual basis, enterprise risks are updated and discussed with the  Board and/or the relevant committees of the Board, including the Audit Committee which has oversight responsible for  enterprise risk management at Broadcom. Broadcom manages actual and potential enterprise risks through various processes, polices and mitigation activities. For example, our Global Operations, which includes our procurement and supply chain activities, use detailed Business  Continuity Plans to manage potential climate-related interruptions to its operations, among other risks. All of our global  sites have Site Control Plans, which provide our response plans in the event of various emergency situations, including  climate-related weather events, like wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and blizzards. We also proactively engage with our stakeholders to understand the potential impacts of both changing regulatory  requirements and changing stakeholder expectations, including our investors, customers, and local communities where  we do business. METRICS AND TARGETS: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material 
a) Disclose the metrics  used by the organization to  assess climate-related risks  and opportunities in line  with its strategy and risk  management process

8,"Current ESG evaluation  methodologies are  fundamentally flawed. To  achieve acutely-needed  change, ESG needs to  evolve to measure real- world Impact. Current environmental, social and governance (ESG)  reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact  on the world. Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar  value of risk / return. Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG  funds of large investment institutions – are perhaps  unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of  companies that make climate change worse, not better. An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the  automotive industry. One might think that the more electric  vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total  volumes, the better its ESG score. However, this is not the  case. As long as a company continues to slightly decrease  emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning  out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up. Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of  total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG  reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. “The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is  how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to  get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to  factor at all.” 
We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes  actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting  individual investors can choose to support companies that  can make and prioritize positive change. On the product front, companies should be required to use  real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it  clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world  figures. An example of this is vehicle “use-phase”  emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle  emissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle  mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically  and almost never reflect real-world data. Automakers often  have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it. When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential  that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent  discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe  workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with  significant upside if their employer does well. Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the  profitability of the company?” We need a system that  evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a  positive impact on the world?” 
This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by  institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies  and the general public. As the world needs to strive for a  substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in  this report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact. The 6.8 million metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use-phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real-world fuel economy of  
~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California). The 1.6 million metric tons of  
solar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero-emission electricity from Tesla solar panels, including energy stored and later dispatched from our  
energy storage products. Geographic distribution of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures. Burned fossil fuel is extremely difficult to decarbonize as carbon capture is not economically viable today 
Battery pack is recycled at the end-of-life and used to build a brand-new battery pack, over and over again. Tesla solar panels have generated more electricity than has been consumed by our vehicles and factories between 2012 and 2021 We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to  sustainable energy. To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the  accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million  electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year  (compared to 4 GWh in 2021). If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle  fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e  emissions every year of usage. Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from  manufacturing to consumer use to recycling. We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our  customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products. Each of these themes will  be covered in this year’s Impact Report. Sustainability drives us. And not just our products — it drives our values and mission as a company. It's at the  core of everything we do and is what motivates us in our work. It also matters greatly to our customers,  employees and shareholders. Our products and services are focused on transportation, energy production and  storage — each of which have traditionally been some of the biggest polluters both in the U.S. and globally. To achieve a zero-emissions future, we continue to implement programs and initiatives at our global  manufacturing facilities and in our local communities. Climate change is reaching alarming levels globally due in large part to emissions from burning fossil fuels for  transportation and electricity generation. The world cannot reduce GHG emissions without addressing both  energy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly  reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors. We are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem. We both develop the  technology behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability of the products that comprise it. We seek to  achieve this through our R&D and software development efforts as well as through our continuous drive to  develop advanced manufacturing capabilities. At Tesla, sustainability is everyone's job regardless of their position, geographic location or title. Our  Sustainability Council, made up of leaders from across Tesla, collects data and prepares the analysis and  content of this report. The Sustainability Council also presents this information to Tesla’s Board of Directors for  review. The Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s  business — including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this  report. With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers  and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry  Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the  importance of sound corporate governance. Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating  framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and  manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company. Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that  should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Tesla’s Code of  Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website. In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees. We encourage Tesla  employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do  so. We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. We  have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback. We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time. Tesla keeps  information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel. Our policies  prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed to  maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns  about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall. Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term  focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate  governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some,  but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success. Some examples include our decisions to: 
• Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV  components 
• Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite  regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so 
• Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively 
• Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to  create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their  own utility 
• Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the  future 
These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately,  decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the  annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. At the same time, the  Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs  stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings. For example, at  our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an  amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years. However, our  stockholders did not approve that proposal. The Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and  participates in robust shareholder outreach and feedback. In addition, our directors have significant experience  as either top-level executives at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs who founded  successful organizations. The Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each  further described in the following pages. Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent  director under the listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession  planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership  structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and  performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates  candidates for election or re-election to the Board. Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the  growing risks and opportunities around ESG. The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for  assessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day-to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of  certain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on  matters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees. The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, assisting the Board in providing oversight of  Tesla’s accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of its financial statements, including  oversight over the integrity of such statements, the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory  requirements, the independent auditor’s qualifications, independence and performance, the organization and  performance of the Company’s internal audit function, as well as the Company’s internal accounting and  financial controls, treasury and finance matters, risk management, including data privacy and cybersecurity. The  Audit Committee also reviews and discusses the accounting assessment of this report and other ESG  disclosures. The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, discharging the Board’s responsibilities in  administering and overseeing Tesla’s compensation policies, plans and benefit programs, the compensation of  Tesla’s executive officers and members of the Board, the administration of the Company’s employee benefit  plans and the review of human capital management practices related to Tesla’s talent generally (including how  Tesla recruits, develops and retains diverse talent). The Disclosure Controls Committee, among other things, implements, reviews and monitors Tesla’s compliance  with applicable legal requirements governing the Company’s and its executive officers’ public disclosures and  public statements relating to the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and  making recommendations to the Board on matters concerning corporate governance, Board composition, the  identification, evaluation and nomination of director candidates and composition of Board committees and  conflicts of interest. In addition, this Committee oversees Tesla’s corporate governance practices and reviews  annually the principles of corporate governance approved by the Board, including the Company’s Code of  Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, to ensure that they remain relevant and are being  complied with and monitored by management, recommending changes to the Board as necessary. Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily  in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear  and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of  stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive  officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any  perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No  named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s  performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award. A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of  the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on  Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational  milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected  the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on  such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we  eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s  compensation is at-risk. Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our  compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in  order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the  long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted  stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based  compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value  and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through  the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are  sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that  are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each  director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic  grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board  determines otherwise. We believe that responsible data management and transparency is a prerequisite for continuous innovation. We  live up to this commitment by providing information and controls in our products that let you choose how your  personal data is collected and used. Data privacy is a shared responsibility in which every employee and our Board is expected to participate. Tesla  has a large and diverse team of privacy and security professionals from all over the world and across legal,  engineering and product organizations, who are dedicated to protecting customer data. Additionally, the Audit  Committee of the Tesla Board of Directors is regularly briefed on incidents, emerging trends, controls and  corrective actions taken by Tesla to ensure we are living up to our obligations and Privacy Principles. Tesla is guided not only legally by its obligations under global privacy laws and regulations, but also by  customer expectations and our Privacy Principles. We do the right thing with data. We maintain trust by handling data as customers expect, keeping it accurate  and complete and properly destroying it when it is no longer needed. • We build privacy into our products from start to finish. Ensuring privacy is an important component when  building world-class products and services, from inception to rollout and beyond. • We give customers choices about their data. We put individuals in control by giving them clear and  transparent ways to access, review, manage and delete their data with ease. • We maintain trust through transparency. We are clear about the personal data we collect and how we're  using or sharing it – ensuring that choosing a connected vehicle does not come at the sacrifice of customer  privacy. • We safeguard personal data. We implement rigorous controls and standards designed to protect the security,  confidentiality and integrity of Tesla’s data environment. Tesla’s Privacy Principles and commitments are illustrated throughout all our products. For Tesla vehicles,  customer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle  data generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number. Tesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in-vehicle  menu to adjust preferences at any time. Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, energy products are designed to protect customer privacy. Tesla  aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary in providing the most engaging in-app energy  experience. In furtherance of transparency, Tesla has developed a seamless way for customers to download and  access their energy data at any time right from the Tesla app. We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. To do that, our team of  world-class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible. And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build  inherently secure systems, we cannot work alone. We work closely with the security research community to  benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought. Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that  every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over-the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have  introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to  drive. We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when  they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime. The ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future. We believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights. Our human rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the  values they represent. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human  Rights (UDHR). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We  are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain — including with respect to our  employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. We require that our  suppliers will also support and promote these values in their own operations and in those of their own suppliers. Addressing human rights risks is an ongoing effort, involving engagement with our value chain for potential  impacts, incorporating input from external stakeholders and reviewing and updating our own policies where  necessary. With this understanding, Tesla is committed to addressing any potential human rights issues both  within our own operations and those of our value chain. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers 
At Tesla, we are committed to ensuring that the way we conduct our business and dealings with our suppliers  reflects our values and our belief that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. Tesla is committed  to ensuring that our suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Modern slavery,  child labor and human trafficking are crimes under the laws of countries throughout the world, but  unfortunately continue to exist all over the globe. Our commitment on this front is summarized in our Supplier  Code of Conduct as well as in our Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy, and we continue to  work to ensure that our suppliers uphold the principles in these statements. We look to the Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use  feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve it. Through our commitment to enforce our Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible  Materials Policy, continuous training and the supplier audit and due diligence efforts, Tesla believes that there is  low risk of, and have found no evidence to date of Tesla causing, contributing to or being linked to modern  slavery, child labor or human trafficking in our supply chain. For more information on our commitment to anti-slavery practices and an affirmation of the values we hold and  adopt across Tesla’s business operations and supply chain, including how we assess risks and effectiveness of  our actions, please see our California Transparency in Supply Chain Acts Statement and our U.K. Modern Slavery  Act Transparency Statement. Our employees have gotten us to where we are today. To continue innovating and changing the world for the  better, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce with ample opportunity to contribute to our  mission and grow professionally. Meaningful work: Working for Tesla is not just any job. The products we build are necessary for transitioning to  a sustainable future. Respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace: Tesla is a majority-minority company. We strive to be a  workplace where people love to come to work every day. While challenges will arise, Tesla has a zero-tolerance  policy for harassment of any kind, and we will continue to address them head on as we keep growing. We hire a lot: We created nearly 100,000 direct new jobs in a decade. While many manufacturers are trimming  their operations, we are growing as quickly as is feasible. Significant upside potential: Every single employee of our company can receive their grants in stocks or  options. If our company does well, every employee can benefit materially from Tesla’s success. Outstanding benefits: We want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing industry. Among other  benefits, we provide medical, dental and vision plans with no paycheck deductions, 401k matching, life  insurance, parental leave and family building benefits. Build the future: Who wouldn’t want to work for a company with a mission of building a future we all want? Tesla’s mission is not only about making a product that people love, but also about making a real, sustained  impact on transitioning the world to sustainable energy. In 2021, we received 3,000,000 job applications from  those wanting to be a part of this mission. Our employee count has grown ~70 fold over the past decade and, in just over ten years, Tesla has created  nearly 100,000 direct jobs. While many companies in the automotive industry have been trimming the number  of employees and launching early retirement programs, we plan to grow our employee base for years to come. As we are aiming to produce over 20x more cars by 2030 than we did in 2021, we will need to continue to build  new factories and hire for those new locations. Gigafactories in Texas and Berlin will recruit extensively starting  this year, which means that our job creation will continue to expand for quite some time. By attracting, developing and retaining excellent talent, we've developed a pipeline of diverse and exceptional  candidates while fostering an inclusive culture that supports them once they become employees. Whether it is through our direct hiring opportunities, internships or workforce development programs, interest  in joining Tesla’s mission is at an all-time high. We had more than 3,000,000 unique applicants globally in 2021  alone. We expanded access to hiring opportunities for underrepresented communities by centering diversity, equity  and inclusion (DEI) in our hiring process. We did so by increasing gender-neutral language in our job  descriptions, broadening our sourcing efforts, revamping interviewing guides, building community partnerships,  educating on unconscious bias and facilitating training for recruiters, hiring managers and interview panelists. According to Universum 2021 rankings, engineering students want to work for Tesla and SpaceX more than any  other organization. Many successful companies with great engineering can become bureaucratic over time. We don’t want to go  that route. At Tesla, great engineering ideas worth implementing can come from interns, analysts or executives. We strive to minimize red tape so our engineers can be creative and solve engineering problems that have  never been solved. Ultimately, the long-term success of any company comes down to the pace of innovation. It doesn’t matter how  far ahead or far behind our technology is, what matters is the pace at which we’re evolving, implementing new  ideas and engineering solutions. In order to maintain our pace of innovation we must continue to attract the  best and the brightest to join our mission. We are continuing to provide the local community access to thousands of job openings across the U.S. in  manufacturing, vehicle service and solar roof installation, offering full benefits and training from day one. We  have long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college degree to work at Tesla. This represents  an enormous opportunity for high school graduates from underserved communities to join us in our mission and  grow their careers. This is a two-year program where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at Tesla as a production  associate while continuing their education in automation and robotics at a local community college. Since its  launch in 2017, we've hired 168 graduates into this program, with active programs at Gigafactory Nevada,  Gigafactory New York and our Fremont Factory. We also launched our first Manufacturing Development  Program class with Del Valle High School to support Gigafactory Texas in fall 2021. In partnership with local community colleges, Tesla offers a federal and state certified Tool & Die Apprenticeship  program in the U.S. at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada and Tesla Grand Rapids. These apprenticeships  blend on-the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to  learning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical  skills. Similar programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory Berlin where we collaborate with local  vocational schools and train students via facilitated workshops, self-led modules and on-the-job exercises for a  variety of roles. To promote gender diversity in STEM, since 2018, Tesla has encouraged girls to see engineering as a means to pursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year, over 1,200 middle school  students from 140 schools across California, Nevada, Texas and New York joined the virtual event which  showcased a variety of engineering career pathways and inspiring female Tesla engineers through virtual tours,  engaging videos and hands-on STEM activities. Similar initiatives take place in Europe, like Girls’ Day, which is  dedicated to girls who want to explore future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage and inspire  them via factory tour visits and conversations with our female employees and leaders. Our internship program continues to be our driving force in attracting diverse entry level professional talent. In  our effort to expand access to our program, we attended more than 75 diversity hiring events targeting women  and students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and launched new  community Internship Initiatives with Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars in Nevada and  College Track in the Bay Area to increase diversity in our program. As part of our agreement to build Gigafactory Nevada, we committed to invest $37.5M into K-12 education  beginning in 2018. This investment is in partnership with the Department of Education and the Education Gift  Fund, with a focus on initiatives that support the acceleration of robotics, STEAM and sustainability  programming. To date, $22.5M has been invested across 30 organizations and an additional $17M planned in  2022-2023. The SHPE National Convention serves as the country’s largest annual gathering of Hispanic STEM students and  professionals. We met over 3,000 students from various disciplines and had the opportunity to build some  great relationships along the way with various SHPE chapter leaders in the country. Tesla’s DEI team also  participated in the SHPETina series during the conference, which is a program that accelerates and affirms  Latina representation at all levels of STEM corporate and academic leadership. Tesla provides a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds the wages of comparable manufacturing roles,  even before equity and benefits are factored in. In 2021, Tesla’s average national wage for manufacturing jobs in  the U.S. was $21.60/hour plus benefits (which, among others listed on the next page, includes an option for $0  cost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2% increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for Production Associates / Assemblers is $18.17 and the median is  $17.59. Tesla continuously reviews salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are  competitive. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually. Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While  share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based  compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive  change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes  of working at Tesla. For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares  quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20  Tesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two  years later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per  share of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through  the Employee Stock Purchase Program. Tesla HR offers a Pay Equity & Pay Transparency educational course to everyone in the People Organization,  with a focus on HR partners and recruiters. This course details what pay equity is, why it is important, how  unconscious bias affects pay and hiring, best practices for hiring and compensation, and how each person can  be an effective partner in helping the company achieve and maintain pay equity. A recorded version of the  course is available to all hiring managers. We also have an annual pay equity program in place, designed to assess whether similarly situated employees  are paid in a similar manner after accounting for a range of variables such as: We proudly offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ health and well-being. These benefits allow  our employees to choose the level of support that is right for them. We offer no-cost paycheck contributions for  medical, dental and vision plan options for employees and family members. We also offer employer-paid life,  short- and long-term disability, confidential counseling for employees and their families, employee assistance  programs and voluntary benefit programs. Lastly, we offer student loan and debt consolidation services, transportation subsidies and $0 cost shuttles, back- up childcare, discount programs and tools and resources to support growing families. • A $0 paycheck contribution medical plan • A Confidential Counseling/Employee Assistance Program • A $0 paycheck contribution dental plan and vision plan • A $0 cost shuttle service to and from underserved transportation hubs in California and Nevada • Employer-paid life insurance • Employer-paid short-term and long-term disability 
• SafetyNet, a benefit that provides limited financial assistance for employees experiencing temporary hardship  such as the sudden loss of housing, emergencies/natural disasters or expenses related to the loss of an  immediate family member 
• 5 days of back-up child/elder care for employees • Infertility benefits, including assisted reproductive technologies • Transgender benefits aligned with the clinical protocol set forth by the World Professional Association for  Transgender Health 
• Rethink, a benefit that provides resources for families with children who have learning, social or behavioral  challenges 
• An expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering that includes travel and lodging support for  those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state Whether it's family planning or support for employees spending time with their family after the birth or  adoption of a child, Tesla provides benefit and leave options to all active full-time employees in the U.S.   
• Fertility Services including IVF, IUI and Egg/Embryo/Sperm Preservations up to $40,000 offered through  Kindbody • Adoption, up to $25,000 offered through Kindbody • Third-Party reproduction services (donor & surrogacy), up to $25,000 offered through Kindbody • 16 weeks of Paid Family Leave • Up to one week of paid time off as a new parent through Tesla Child Bonding. This benefit can be taken  following the birth or adoption of a child by an employee, their spouse or domestic partner. • Six weeks of paid time off for new parents that have worked for Tesla for at least one year (12 consecutive  months) • Disability benefits • Pay for nine weeks of maternity leave When going through a challenging period or when the viability of a business is not yet clear, it’s likely to have  an impact on employee satisfaction. Our early years of Model 3 production and global expansion were some of  the most difficult in our history and our employee satisfaction ratings (Glassdoor) reflected that. Our company is in a different phase now. Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and  profitability (operating margin) rose to the highest in the industry. This has fueled our ability to expand  dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. Compensation, linked to the  performance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years. There’s still a lot of work to be done, predominantly when it comes to work-life balance. Our goals have always  been, and still are, bold. Expectations are understandably high as a result. We recently introduced unlimited  vacation for salaried employees and added more family benefits. Both Glassdoor rankings as well as our internal  data show that our employees are becoming happier as a result of our growing success as well as our expanded  employee benefit programs. We believe our employees should have opportunities without limitations. Employees that start in junior roles  can ultimately become company leaders – and many of our long-term employees have done exactly that. Upward mobility in our fast environment is a significant contributor to retaining top talent. We want to make  sure that our employees continue to learn and evolve. As nearly 70% of our leadership is promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of  successful progression. Our global headcount increased by over 40% in 2021. At that pace of growth, some level  of external hiring will be necessary. If possible, we do our best to fill each leadership role with an internal  candidate. In 2020, we instituted quarterly diversity data reviews across different divisions. These ensure that we identify  trends across functions instead of simply looking at our workforce at the company-wide level. Executives review  organizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to  attract, develop and retain talent. That same year, we also took steps to incorporate DEI principles into talent management. The fundamental pillar  in this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews — a reliable review process leads to more equitable  access to internal opportunities. Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all  employees globally. The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees'  access to career opportunities within Tesla. We expanded our leadership development team with a focus on providing DEI offerings to all our U.S.  employees. Now all employees are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation and  can continue their DEI learning journey throughout their time at Tesla. From our allyship resources, to DEI Life  Hacks on our DEI Knowledge Center, to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive interviewing  and inclusive leadership, our employees have access to information no matter where they are. Our DEI team uses a people-first and data-driven approach to champion diversity, equity and inclusion in our  business and in the communities in which we operate. We rely on the following guiding principles: 
• Provide transparency in our DEI programs, identify areas of improvement, celebrate successes and  continually iterate and improve our DEI approach 
• Focus on sustainable solutions that solve problems at the root cause and reimagine new programs with DEI  principles embedded in the design 
• Share knowledge throughout all levels of the organization to aid in personal and professional learning and  development We are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities  that have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of  December 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents were non-white. This is a large percentage,  considering that just 0.3% of our employees are director level and above at Tesla. We are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our  intentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions,  activations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTech, as well as  community partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code. We are also working to  ensure that the diversity in our entry-level roles will, over time and because of internal movement, be reflected  in our leadership roles. Tesla data are representative of calendar year 2020 – the latest available EEO-1 filing as of the publishing of this report. Diversity data requires context. We have compared our diversity data with that of other tech companies. In  nearly all categories, Tesla’s representation of people of color exceeds that of peer companies. We are working to increase gender representation throughout the company by supporting women-focused  organizations and conferences like Society of Women Engineers, Latinas In Tech, TechUp For Women, Silicon  Valley Forum, Women in Technology Festival, Women in Technology International and Women in Manufacturing. We also launched Tesla Recharge Returnship Program – a four-month paid work program that initially  targeted women impacted by the pandemic and later expanded to support all mid-career professionals  transitioning back into the workforce after a leave of one year or more. The table below shows Tesla employee distribution compared to average employee distribution of U.S. tech  companies. Values that are higher than the tech company average distribution are shown with positive values  and green shading. Values that are lower than the average are shown with negative values and yellow shading. Tesla data are representative of calendar year 2020 – the latest available EEO-1 filing as of the publishing of this report. Competitor data is based on their latest publicly available disclosure. For a detailed explanation of our comparison methodology, please see page 134 of this report. The diversity gap is even more pronounced when compared to automotive manufacturers. In nearly every job  category, our employee base is more racially diverse than the automotive industry average. This is partially a  function of the location of our factories. That said, our journey towards diversity, equity and inclusion is not  finished and we continue to develop programs to make sure our employee base reflects the diversity of our  country's population. The table below shows Tesla employee distribution compared to average employee distribution of U.S.  automotive companies. Values that are higher than the Automotive company average distribution are shown  with positive values and green shading. Values that are lower than the average are shown with negative values  and yellow shading.

For a detailed explanation of our comparison methodology, please see page 134 of this report. Drawing upon unique skills from their service, veterans play an essential role in achieving our goals. With  dedicated veteran recruiting resources and professional development opportunities, we prioritize an inclusive  and supportive environment for transitioning veterans. Tesla also supports numerous organizations that sponsor  veteran hiring and have expanded outreach efforts throughout the country to more military bases and  community organizations. Tesla prides itself in being a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ+ community. This is demonstrated  by our 7th consecutive 100% Corporate Equality Index with the Human Rights Campaign. Tracking the size of our  LGBTQ+ employee base is not a straightforward task for variety of reasons, which is why we will not be sharing  specific figures in this report. Our DEI governance structure supports our business operations. Our Senior Director of People engages with our  Board of Directors to ensure our DEI plans are in alignment with Tesla’s strategic objectives. We also integrate  our talent management and learning and development into the DEI functional scope to ensure equitable talent,  career and learning resources are accessible to all employees. The DEI Director reports directly to the Senior  Director of People and has regular engagement with company executives across the company to ensure that  DEI principles are embedded into our business. The DEI Director is responsible for all of Tesla’s talent  management and learning programs. The diverse representation on our Board of Directors sets the tone for the rest of the company. Data are representative of calendar year 2021, as measured on December 31, 2021. Totals may not add to 100% due to rounding or individuals  who selected “decline to state” or left the category blank. During the global pandemic, we focused a great deal on expanding our community engagement and ensuring  our employees stayed connected. Specifically, we expanded our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and  ensured our programming was accessible in a remote work environment. We welcomed Asian Pacific Islanders  at Tesla to our ERG family. While this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our  employees felt more heard and connected than ever before as they pivoted to virtual events to promote  inclusion across different locations, physical boundaries and time zones. At Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities to provide  goods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process. We formalized collaboration between the  DEI, Supply Chain and Government Affairs teams to ensure local minority, women, LGBTQ+, disabled and  veteran owned businesses are connected to opportunities with Tesla. We recognize that supplier diversity  creates a competitive advantage for the company and has a positive impact on the global community. As the  supplier diversity program develops, we will implement plans that encourage increased usage of diverse  suppliers throughout our organization, partner with internal and external stakeholders to identify opportunities  for diverse suppliers and work with external partners to encourage capacity building for diverse suppliers. We strive to create an environment where people love to come to work every day. With over 100,000  employees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on. In 2021, we re-doubled our efforts to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be  reported. While our goal is always prevention, reported complaints of discrimination and harassment are  promptly investigated and if substantiated, subject to discipline up to and including termination. New  employees receive anti-harassment and discrimination training during orientation. A new employee guidebook  was also rolled out which instructs employees to report all forms of misconduct without concern. As the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers per year, educating our workforce is a top  priority and an ongoing process. We believe it’s essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment where all  employees can achieve their potential. As a result, we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any  mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations. Below are some of the actions we are  taking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees. Training: Code of Business Ethics and harassment & discrimination training for front-line leaders, HR partners  and other employees to understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess situations sooner  and escalate appropriately. Internal Tracking System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows HR to  document all employee concerns that are raised to ensure there is follow through and resolution for tracking  purposes. Additionally, handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent them from becoming bigger issues. The case management system also allows the appropriate teams to review data to trend and issue spot, which  then can lead to proactive solutions before concerns arise. Internal Mobility: A program that advocates for and provides equal access to employee advancement  opportunities and retention with eligibility for opportunities based on standardized performance reviews. Opportunities are advertised on an internal site with career resources in addition to a monthly newsletter. We  also offer 1-on-1 support and personal consultations to understand the career aspirations of internal applicants. We encourage employees to raise concerns internally or externally. An employee can raise concerns or  complaints to any member of management, Human Resources or Employee Relations (ER). If they prefer to  report another way, the Integrity Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Integrity Line allows  employees to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation. If any employee raises a good faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee concerns are  investigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The Employee Relations  team engages in feedback loops with leaders and HR to provide guidance on any appropriate follow-up actions,  which range from additional communication and training to corrective action and discipline up to termination of  employment. Employee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee  retention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while  company-wide open-door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard. When we feel  connected to the Tesla community and mission, we unlock our full potential as a workforce. To promote engagement, we lead initiatives driven by employee feedback. Throughout the year, we use  roundtables, engagement surveys and other feedback forms to gather data and better understand the  employee experience. Our team uses this data to inform our communication strategies. In addition to a monthly newsletter emailed to  all U.S. employees and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company-wide internal  news platform with weekly updates on company news, employee recognition and events. We highlight business, people and safety updates via both email and an expansive network of video screens. In  2021, we also produced two live and virtual companywide all-hands. These channels pair with the revitalization of daily Start-Up meetings for assembly workers to streamline  communications across the Fremont Factory. HR members also staff on-site Answer Bar kiosks to address  employee questions and concerns at many of our office locations. Engagement requires making resources more accessible. This translates to regular on-site tabling and fairs for  benefits, as well as making information available digitally. We manage internal resource websites for product  knowledge, employee perks, recognition, employee volunteering, health and fitness and offer virtual info  sessions with subject matter experts. We are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our relief efforts to the conflict in  Ukraine have provided people with the ability to communicate and power communities. In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits  containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When  paired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants  can assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls. Along with Starlink Terminals used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the  Ukranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military trucks. The kit can begin providing  power almost instantly, without any tools or technical experience required. With the Powerwall kit alone, a user  can power Starlink for five days. With solar panels installed and operational, the kits can provide indefinite  power for Starlink Terminal, plus a small appliance or laptop. In addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia and  Hungary to support those impacted by the recent events. Within hours of implementation, Tesla emailed local  owners announcing that several Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by Tesla and non-Tesla  electric vehicles, free-of-charge. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Tesla worked with NGO partners such as the Footprint Project, and certified  installers in the New Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives, Posigen) to deploy Powerwall and solar panel disaster  relief systems. We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a  warehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs. Most systems stayed in place for six weeks  while the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back  up the systems remained in place for substantially longer. Our partners estimate that these systems provided  power to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders. After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton,  Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project. These systems helped power communications trailers and  mobile offices for over 50 recovery workers. They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are  exploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers. In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days  affecting thousands of residents. Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services,  Inc., a non-profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to  communities across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of  batteries and 40kW of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities,  enabling it to resume housing and other social services to children. In 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We were able to  improve our performance in Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts in  Tesla – our own employees. We evolved the way we define safety, developed internal tools to drive execution,  actively sought worker improvement suggestions and established a more structured EHS&S audit program to  identify safeguards and drive operational excellence throughout all areas of the business. As we grew and evolved as an EHS&S organization, so did our view of safety. The Human and Organizational  Performance (HOP) and Operational Learning group was developed in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety  into the organization. In an ever-changing and dynamic work environment, we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to  fail safely. Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised of three components: 
1. Engaged workers: workers who are connected to and care about the work they do. When workers are  engaged, they are more likely to identify and communicate vulnerabilities in the system. 2. Agility: the ability to continuously navigate and adapt in an ever-changing, complex and dynamic work  environment. 3. Safeguards: the hardware, software and human actions that directly prevent an event or mitigate a bad  outcome. Instead of defining safety as the absence of accidents, we define safety as the presence of capacity. Capacity  can be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes and reduce system brittleness. In order to build capacity and allow our workers to fail safely, we needed a more dynamic approach to how we  collect and manage data that allows us to make decisions that reduce risk. In response to that need, we  developed an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the  intake and visualization of data globally. We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better  manage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested  by our employees. Foremost in this effort was our improvement suggestion module — Take Charge. Combined with Action Tracker,  this module allows workers to submit improvement suggestions in various categories, including environment,  health, safety, security, people and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors and other work groups to  identify and implement solutions to improve the presence of safeguards. Leading the way with Take Charge submissions is Sherry Ihrig, with over 1,800 improvement suggestions to  safety, processes, cost-savings and more since the program’s start in early 2021. “Tesla promotes the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’ and the Take Charge program truly  empowers me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,” Ihrig said. “The Take Charge program encourages associates to increase their awareness of the work environment,” Ihrig said. “When these and other potential safety hazards are noticed and resolved, it allows associates to improve  their overall work performance.” 
While Ihrig has enjoyed many parts of her experience at Tesla, from teaming up with “hardworking, outgoing  individuals” to learning how to operate a fire extinguisher in emergency response training, the most exciting  part has been the Take Charge program. Engaged employees like Sherry help Tesla build capacity to ensure safeguards are in place and functioning, so  that when we fail, we fail safely. Since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2019 and the subsequent variants, we have proactively protected our  workers. Teams have contributed to country, state and local regulations to ensure the voice of industry was  represented in the drafting and implementation of policies. Our pandemic management team continues to engage with employees at all levels. We consistently re-examine  operations through risk assessments as a key element for managing the ever-changing COVID-19 work  environment. Our dedicated Infectious Disease Team aggressively monitors on-going changes across the world  to stay healthy and compliant with the differences in localities. • Conducted 59 free, on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics • Administered 14,811 COVID-19 vaccinations • Received vaccination and booster information from 48% of employees using our internal tracking system,  helping monitor progress • Gifted employees $86,500 in cash and prizes to encourage vaccinations 
We established the Compliance Audit Program in 2021 to provide an objective assessment of the management  of EHS&S risk at a site level throughout the various businesses. We have conducted 31 audits so far that: 
• Focused on compliance with Tesla EHS&S standards and regulatory requirements • Engaged site-level EHS&S professionals to audit other Tesla sites, maximizing technical knowledge across the  businesses • Identified best practices that can be replicated across other sites • Provided guidance and assistance to sites addressing and closing out corrective and preventive actions 
The audit outcomes provided opportunities for workers to identify and employ improvement solutions, adjust  to the changing work environment where necessary, verify and validate existing safeguards, and implement new  safeguards and improve our overall capacity. Gigafactory Nevada became the first Tesla site to have a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) application  accepted. VPP is an OSHA program that recognizes employers in the private industry who have implemented  effective safety and health management systems and maintain injury and illness rates below national Bureau of  Labor Statistics averages for their respective industries. Next step will be a rigorous onsite evaluation by a team  of health and safety professionals in May 2022. Security of our people, the planet, our property and products continues to be a core factor to enable  production execution and build capacity throughout our entire organization. Our manufacturing locations have dedicated physical and technical security teams, while at our service centers  and remote sites, we augment physical security with our SHIELD ambassadors. SHIELD is Tesla's Security  Ambassador project that helps increase security awareness at all Tesla locations, especially those without an  on-site security team. The Tesla SHIELD program is designed to educate individuals with the basic security requirements for their  building, to allow them to present the issues to their site manager for resolution and be able to escalate larger  issues to the Security Team for support. • 271 Security SHIELD Ambassadors registered at 176 locations across 24 countries to help support on-site  security needs • 37,154 workers trained in basic security and awareness courses As we continue to increase production, our focus remains on maintaining positive safety records. We examine  our safety data to identify emerging risks, comparable events for innovative solutions and to better understand  how we can systematically improve across our highest risk areas to help keep our people, the planet, our  products and property safe. We have turned our attention away from traditional OSHA metrics, but we continue to maintain information on  them for regulatory purposes. We use these metrics, amongst many others, to examine how how we can see the  results of our commitment to safety. This will be the last year that we present recordable injuries per car produced – which captures all injuries and  illness regardless of their severity or relation to work. Instead, we will use the American Society for Testing and  Materials (ASTM) standard E2920-19. ASTM better represents our global reach and more clearly illuminates  serious injuries and illnesses, allowing our focus to remain on preventing and mitigating outcomes of our  highest-risk activities. As our manufacturing footprint expanded into Austin and Berlin, and our Shanghai location accelerated  production, Fremont continued with the unwavering manufacturing of all Tesla cars. Fremont Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate has remained below the North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) average for automobile manufacturing for the previous three years and continues  to drive performance through the integration of safety in design and the verification and validation of  safeguards. In order to concentrate on the events that matter most, we have made great efforts to increase our focus on  events of significant consequence. We continue to track and report on OSHA statistics for our U.S.-based sites,  such as DART rates for more serious injuries/illnesses, but we are shifting our view to be more forward thinking  and globally inclusive. We transitioned to the ASTM standard E2920-19 as our global metric in 2020 to better reflect our global  presence and have an increased focus on serious injuries and illnesses. Other automakers have not yet adopted  this standard, so we are benchmarking against other manufacturing and service industries. We made this  change in response to studies indicating the statistical invalidity of previous metrics (Total Recordable Injury  Rate [TRIR]) as measures of safety outcomes. We continue to concentrate our prevention and mitigation efforts in our highest risk areas across all lines of  business and are accelerating forward with our strategies to ensure essential safeguards are in place and  functioning. In 2020, COVID–19 impacted our operations including the shutdown of the Fremont Factory;  therefore, we are using 2021 as our baseline year. Sadly in 2021, Tesla experienced a fatality which occurred during a vehicle test drive outside of the U.S.  Extensive global actions have been implemented based on our operational learning including limiting speeds  and designated test drive routes. In 2021, we kicked off our Constructing Our Future initiative that focused on empowering our project teams and  partners to accelerate contractor onboarding as well as to simplify our requirements to ensure work is  conducted safely and effectively. Rather than uploading a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) completed off-site, contractors and suppliers are now  expected to meet a Tesla Responsible Person and EHS&S professional at the location of work to complete a  Pre-Work Risk Assessment. Over 5,000 companies were onboarded, and 587 Tesla Responsible Persons (TRP) and Contractor Responsible  Persons (CRP) were trained in the new process. This level of involvement resulted in increased contractor  responsibility, improved communication and more thorough Pre-Work Risk Assessments, which identified  critical and high-risk activities. Shifting from a hazard-based approach to a risk-based approach provides a better opportunity for EHS&S  success by discussing critical and high-risk operations. In addition, we support the Constructing Our Future with written procedures, training resources and forms  which are easily accessible to Tesla stakeholders. This strategic approach helps us create the framework  necessary to build safely, efficiently and consistently. We are on schedule to release the new and improved supplier and contractor onboarding and management  system, Workforce Management, in the second quarter of 2022. This simple, scalable, centralized system will  build on the efficiencies of the interim onboarding process and provide better visibility for managers and  engineers to track performance. The biggest environmental impact is achieved through early displacement of ICE vehicles and replacing them  with EVs. Additionally, we want to displace fossil-based energy generation with renewable energy generation. As of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0  Gigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt-hours (TWhs) of emissions-free  electricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used  to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our  vehicles in that same period combined. We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. It is our goal to eventually  have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. Additionally, we  are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to  meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way. Introduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions and use-phase emissions of our vehicles 
In this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased  electricity, heat, etc. for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations. This information is not only  important to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track  progress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations. While the most important work we can do  to reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to  reducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also  makes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes. It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs – this is economically unfeasible for ICE  vehicles 
We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE)  vehicles. The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla  produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives. This becomes more  pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the  entire lifecycle — from raw materials to use-phase emissions to disposal — and not just at vehicle usage  emissions. • Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (both of which overestimate fuel-economy and underestimate  emissions) rather than real-world data 
The manufacturing process of Model 3 and Model Y currently results  in slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion  engine vehicle. However, based on the global weighted average grid  mix, Model 3 and Model Y have lower lifetime emissions than an  equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles. Lifetime CO2e emitted by an average internal combustion engine  vehicle (model year 2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase,  excluding CO2e emitted during the oil refining phase. The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real-world fuel consumption or electricity  consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use-phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such  as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real-world fuel or energy consumption. Therefore, we used:  
EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and  Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process. ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid-size premium  sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. This translates to over 400 grams of CO2e per mile once we account for  emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil. The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year 
Based on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly  less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its  fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs  has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below, we show zero- emission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without factoring in any  changes to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current  trends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time. 1NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 22021-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts. Conservatively assumes no change in federal policy or acceleration of move to renewables in the  U.S. for electricity generation. This includes emissions from upstream supply chain, direct emissions from manufacturing and electricity  consumption and use-phase emissions when charged from a grid with a generation mix that reflects the  geographic distribution of Model 3 and Model Y deliveries in the U.S., Europe and China. Below are the lifecycle  emissions scenarios we show, and the assumptions used in each of the charts on the following pages: 
Average Premium ICE: The reference ICE vehicle is based on an average of mid-size premium sedans and mid- size premium crossover SUVs, with a real-world fuel economy of 24.3 MPG. Model 3/Y* Personal Use (Grid Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were principally  charged at home from the grid. Model 3/Y Ridesharing Use (Grid Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for  ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from Tesla energy products, charged from the grid. Model 3/Y Personal Use (Solar Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were principally  charged at home using a solar system and energy storage. Model 3/Y Ridesharing Use (Solar Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for  ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from our energy products and if it were only charged  using a solar system and energy storage. • Charging a Model 3/Y using solar panels and a Powerwall adds emissions to the manufacturing phase while  reducing use-phase emissions to as low as zero when 100% of charging is done using that system. • We conservatively assume no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle  given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve is still very much up for debate. • Manufacturing phase emissions for Model 3/Y in the U.S. represent a Fremont-made vehicle, while  manufacturing phase emissions in Europe and China represent a China-made vehicle. * This year we have added the impact of Model Y to the emissions per mile calculation in our LCA. Given that Model 3 and Model Y have 70%+  parts commonality and share many manufacturing processes their GHG footprints are very similar. We have decided to present the LCA as a  weighted average of Model 3 and Model Y based on production share for each vehicle (for manufacturing phase emissions) and delivery volumes  in each region (for use-phase emissions). To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York-based Tesla vehicle equates to  the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 109 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market). Even  when charging a Tesla in Michigan, where approximately 60% of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the  emissions from our vehicles still equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with 52 real-world MPG  (considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG). As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to  generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further. EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy  storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes. This dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an  EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar Roof and Powerwall  manufacturing and upstream supply chain. A cleaner grid in Europe means a bigger emissions gap between Model 3 and a comparable ICE vehicle 
In Europe, the U.K. and EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), larger portions of energy  generation come from either renewable sources or nuclear, which means that in Europe the use-phase emissions  gap between ICEs and EVs is even wider than it is in the U.S. 
On the other hand, since an average European driver covers fewer miles per year than a U.S. driver, emissions  from the manufacturing phase are divided by fewer miles. While in the U.S., an average vehicle covers 200,000  miles before getting scrapped, in Europe, total mileage is closer to 150,000 miles. We used Austria as an example of how use-phase emissions should evolve once the European grid becomes  greener. As seen in the chart on the right, in Austria, all-in lifecycle emissions of a personal, grid-charged Model  3Y are over 3.5x lower than all-in lifecycle emissions of an equivalent ICE vehicle. In China, much of the grid is powered by coal. That said, even in this scenario, charging a Tesla Model 3Y from  the grid is still less emission intensive than running an ICE vehicle. Just like in Europe, we have assumed a  vehicle lifetime of 150,000 miles. We are expecting the grid mix in China to improve dramatically over time as China remains a dominant deployer  and manufacturer of renewable energy. Sichuan Province (with a population of 81 million) is a great example of  this. In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration, charging an EV from the grid  is less polluting than charging an EV in most global countries or states. In conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla Model 3Y in any of our major markets is more environmentally  friendly than burning gasoline. Considering that vehicles are used for 17 to 20 years before getting scrapped, it  is reasonable to assume that in the coming years, the gap in emissions per mile between EVs and ICEs will only  get wider. Tesla vehicles are among the most efficient EVs built to date. In the early days of Model S production, we were  able to achieve energy efficiency of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh. Model Y All-Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles  / kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date. The gap between Tesla AWD vehicle  efficiency continues to stand out compared to competitors in the same segment. While achieving the best-in- class energy efficiency, our AWD models can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model Y) and  reach a top speed of 145 mph (135 mph for Model Y). In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to  achieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part. The energy efficiency of Tesla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain  efficiency. It is also reasonable to assume that our high-mileage products, such as our future Tesla Robotaxis,  will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration and top speed become less relevant. This will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven. Building a factory from the ground up with sustainability in mind can have a material impact on reducing energy  use. For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the  vehicle production process, energy consumption declines. In our quest for constant improvement, we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the  previous one. For example, at Gigafactory Texas, we chose highly efficient, insulated, low emissivity windows to  reduce building heating and cooling demand. In addition, waste heat recovery from our compressors alone will  offset over 1 MW of natural gas consumption for process heating. While we have already completed substantial  improvements at Gigafactory Shanghai, further improvements will continue at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg  and Gigafactory Texas. All our new factories are designed to be covered with solar panels. As of the end of 2021, we had installed solar  panels with a capacity of 21,405 kW, with the vast majority installed on the roofs of Gigafactory Nevada,  Gigafactory New York and our manufacturing facilities in California. We will continue to add more capacity to  these and other facilities as space allows and as is economically feasible. We are leveraging six years of sensor data from Gigafactory Nevada to train an artificial intelligence (AI)  program to safely control 195 interconnected HVAC units, accounting for 6MW of total electrical load. In its first  full year of operation, we have measured significant load reduction compared to baseline usage. For such  comparison, we look at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two modes under the same conditions  (operations in the factory, time of year, external temperature, etc.). AI control is expected to achieve significant  energy savings for Tesla as it is scaled up to control a majority share of HVAC equipment at Gigafactory Nevada  as well as HVAC equipment at other Gigafactories. We will not be content until all our factories are carbon neutral, and there are other projects that we are  working on to further reduce emissions. In order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, we also need  to use less energy to produce them. Many of the projects created to achieve this goal were showcased at our  Battery Day presentation in September 2020. At Tesla’s 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode  process. Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and  using massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell  production consumes a lot of energy. The new dry-electrode process allows for the direct transition from a  cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing  phase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis. We plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations,  whether it is at our factories, sales, service or delivery locations or through our Supercharger network. Tesla’s battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after  approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe. Creating a battery that  could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven  for high-mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks. Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission. All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles  every year. A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a  disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions. A single  future Tesla vehicle with a million-mile battery could be utilized over five-times more than an average vehicle in  the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its  materials used in a brand-new battery. Note: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lower mileages above likely  reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high-utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age. Performance of newer chemistries (not yet shown here) can vary and we plan to expand disclosure once we have sufficient data. We can make the biggest impact on GHG emissions by selling as many of our products as possible. Undoubtedly, the use-phase of our products avoids more lifetime emissions than either our operations or our  supply chain could. However, in support of our mission, we track and try to minimize emissions that result from  our full value chain, including our supply chain, manufacturing processes as well as our sales, service and  delivery activities. In 2021, we began measuring our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions considering the principles and guidance  of the GHG Protocol. We used the operational control approach methodology – accounting for GHG emissions  from operations under our control. For detailed information on the scope of our calculations, please see page  139-142 of this report. While our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions may increase on an absolute basis in the near term as we  continue to open new factories, our goal is to reduce the emissions intensity from production as we push the  boundaries of sustainable manufacturing and improve the efficiency of our operations. As part of our  commitment to reducing our overall emissions in the long term we signed up for the Science-Based Target  Initiative (SBTi) in 2021. 1 SSD = Sales, Service & Delivery 2 Other includes sites that conduct research & development, administration, energy product warehousing and deployment, and other mixed-used  warehousing. *PwC performed an attest review engagement on this metric. See their report on page 138. Scope 3 GHG emissions calculations are highly academic, even those widely used and accepted like the GHG  Protocol. Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on. Therefore,  most Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting is done using lofty assumptions as well as estimates from databases – this can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact. Tesla has begun to measure the two  largest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain. Tesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and  storage products — we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures  and can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match. This also means that we can calculate our use  of product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle  because we have primary data. Prioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy  and emissions data for us to report on. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our  supply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions — see  the Supply Chain section for more detail. The good thing for us is that Tesla’s high level of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean  we are positioned to manage upstream emissions better than most. Efficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve throughout its lifetime. EVs will get cleaner over their lifetime as  the grid becomes greener. We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their  emissions beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the  grid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind. The global Supercharger network was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources and annual renewable matching. Additionally, all home charging in California was 100% renewable  through annual renewable matching. Therefore, the only emissions from the use of Tesla vehicles were a result of  home charging outside of California and use of third-party charging networks. According to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with  the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes  over eight million premature deaths annually. That is double the previous estimate of deaths from the negative  effects of fine-particle pollution and would account for one-in-five premature deaths worldwide. This is a major  advantage of EVs that is often forgotten about as the overall EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse gases. EVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very much about addressing preventable deaths today. While air-quality is often categorized as a problem in developing countries, Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and other  PM2.5 particulates* cause significant issues in developed countries as well. In Europe alone, almost 800,000  people die prematurely every year due to pollution-related illnesses. EVs not only reduce the world's total  carbon footprint, but also help to reduce city pollution. Combination trucks – of which the vast majority are semi trucks – in the U.S. account for just 1.1% of the total  fleet of vehicles on the road. That said, because combination trucks have high fuel consumption due to their  weight and heavy utilization, they account for approximately 18% of all U.S. vehicle emissions. Electrifying the  heavy-duty truck segment is an essential part of transitioning the world to sustainable energy. With both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect  the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to  be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000  pounds). When fully loaded, the Tesla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through  aerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per  kWh. While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long-distance hauling to also be  sustainable. We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S.  and Europe, where each Tesla Semi could top up their range. Tesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s  transition to sustainable energy. Right now, cell availability is  the limiting factor for production – a Tesla Semi requires  multiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle. Waste Generated Per Vehicle Manufactured As we build more efficient factories, our waste per vehicle decreases 
Building localized factories both makes sense economically and reduces waste. First, because the automotive  supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be  shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary. Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory,  which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less  material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging. The chart  below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S.  We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas to  continue the same trend. The vast majority of generated waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable. At Gigafactory Shanghai,  for example, just 7% of total waste generated in 2021 was not recyclable. We push for innovative approaches to reducing waste, which includes reduction of non-recyclable materials in  the first place, learning from local factories and deploying improvements globally or working with our logistics  team to minimize shipments and packaging per vehicle. • Global Vehicle Manufacturing = all major factories dedicated to vehicle manufacturing, including the Fremont Factory and supporting facilities, Gigafactory Nevada and  Gigafactory Shanghai. • Legacy Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Nevada, Fremont Factory and supporting facilities. • New Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Shanghai. There is a misconception that producing an EV requires more water than producing an ICE vehicle. Our data  shows this is not the case. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on  how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water  at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established  carmakers. Furthermore, the efficient manufacturing design we are implementing at our new factories in Texas  and Berlin-Brandenburg will result in further reductions in our water usage per vehicle. Our goal is to have  industry-leading low water usage per vehicle, even when accounting for cell manufacturing. The below chart  includes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities. While many recognize the impact that power generation has on GHG emissions, its impact on water  consumption is less appreciated. Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S.,  as water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam-driven turbine generators and to  cool power-producing equipment. This means that every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced  not only lowers GHG emissions, but also lowers water consumption. *Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design. Actual production figures will not be known until factories are ramped to full production  speed. Water is becoming increasingly scarce as the climate changes. That is why we are reducing our water usage  throughout our operations as much as possible. We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will  continue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery. The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint  operations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling  tower makeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some  of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce  water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells). 1. Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by  optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations. At Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade  rinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing. 2. Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1  million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be  recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an  estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water  condenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse  this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water. 3. Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting  the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses. At Gigafactory Texas, this could  result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually. Reclaimed water is available  and under investigation for use at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.

Emissions credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non-polluting  products by allowing them to sell their credits to polluting companies. In order to meet various countries’  emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non-polluting companies through credit  purchases. The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves  become non-polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for  their non-polluting credits. In 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero-emission regulatory credits to other OEMs. Proceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace  ICE vehicles. While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other  companies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet  increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive  EVs. In 2021, Tesla delivered almost 1 million EVs globally. We hope that every car manufacturer will strive to produce  hundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reduction of emissions will only be achieved if all  carmakers push for an industry-wide shift to EVs.

Consumers are unlikely to buy products only because they have a low lifetime carbon footprint. In order to  convince consumers to buy our products, they need to be better in every way – performance, cost of ownership,  safety, fun and more. We want to make products that people love. Model 3 is the first EV in history priced competitively with its gas-powered equivalents, even before taking into  consideration any regional subsidies and lower running costs. Unfortunately, most other EVs on the market  today are often priced at over a $10,000 premium compared to their direct ICE vehicle equivalents. Tesla’s ability to achieve our mission rests first and foremost on our products. We are not just trying to build the  best electric cars, we are striving to build the best cars, period. Our focus from the beginning has been to  develop products that are not only sustainable, but also superior to fossil-fuel alternatives in every way. Many  incorrectly believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or  performance, but Tesla vehicles combine performance, safety, efficiency and competitive prices. Similarly,  Tesla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and remote communities with reliable,  affordable energy. Over 5 years of average driving, the ownership costs of a Tesla Model 3 are closer to a Camry than a 3 Series 
The accessibility of our products is fundamental to our mission. While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to  an equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be  considered. The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance  costs, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained  exceptionally strong since our initial launch. As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series,  but the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s best-selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*. The advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real-world data  rather than only being able to use estimates. We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost  of repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc. Additionally, the insurance cost for the Model 3 RWD below is based on  the projected median insurance rate in the U.S. for Tesla Model 3 drivers. Our analysis shows that over five years  and 60,000 miles, running a Model 3 RWD costs 63 cents per mile. Notably, running costs such as fuel (electricity or gasoline), maintenance, tires and repairs for Model 3 should  cost just over half of a mass-market ICE vehicle such as a Toyota Camry. For an EV to have an impact on the environment, it must be genuinely displacing internal combustion engine  miles, rather than sitting in the driveway as a secondary car used for errands or short trips only. Our data shows  that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally  being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose  between price, quality, usability and sustainability. An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers  don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles. There is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary-use vehicle. The more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less  they will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle. Surveys consistently indicate that the real or  perceived lack of EV range is the key reason why many people do not consider replacing their ICE vehicle with  an EV. Freedom of travel is the reason people buy vehicles in the first place. To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles  with EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles. While most personal  vehicle journeys are relatively short, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can  meet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets all their driving needs. Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405  miles of range for the long-range version. Our focus on energy efficiency — achieving superior range from the  same size battery — has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively  stable. Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla customers do. After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare. Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers  are often likely to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before  continuing the journey. Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15  minutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack. We’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point. While coverage  is important, uptime is essential. Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near- empty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working. In 2021 alone, we opened 912 new  Supercharger locations around the world for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations with over 31,000 plugs. 1Uptime of Supercharger sites reflects the average percentage of sites globally that had at least 50% daily capacity functional for the year. At Tesla, safety features are not optional. Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle. When we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe. This section of the Impact Report will  detail our key efforts on the Vehicle Safety front. In addition to designing and building cars with the highest levels of real-world safety, we've also been working  on ways to help our customers drive as safely as possible. Through our Tesla Insurance program, we do just this  by providing real time feedback to customers and incentives for safe driving such as reductions in monthly  insurance premiums. Customers who choose to be a part of this program receive a Safety ScoreBeta. This score changes based on  driving behavior and the insurance premium changes with it. Instead of determining a driver’s insurance  premiums from demographic information (gender, age, education, or marital status) and financial history (credit  score), our algorithm calculates Safety ScoreBeta based on actual driver behavior. The behaviors we monitor are:  
Our data show a lower rate of collision for the cohort of customers who have enabled Safety ScoreBeta. As the  vehicle’s Safety ScoreBeta increases, the number of collisions per mile decreases and insurance premiums reduce. Our commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external  cameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic  Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle-Aware  Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more — all of which continue to improve over time through software  updates. We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm: 
When a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high. Thanks to our eight-camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s  trajectory as well as a stop sign. A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver. Pressing the accelerator pedal when the circumstances indicate you should be pressing the brake instead, like  when pulling into a parking space, is relatively common no matter what vehicle you're in. However, if you are in  a Tesla, when our cameras recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication Mitigation” system cuts  torque from the electric motor to prevent a collision if you happen to press hard on the accelerator. This  technology has prevented or mitigated hundreds of collisions every month. If a driver is changing into a lane while a vehicle in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle  starts departing its lane without an indicator, our vehicles will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a  collision. Many people assume that AEB (Automatic Emergency Breaking) – a system that most new vehicles are  equipped with – works equally well with all vehicles. That’s not the case. The range of sensors, compute power  and quality of software in the system can vary dramatically. Our active safety features are powered by eight  cameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. After the introduction of Tesla Vision (a vision-only system that excludes radar), our active safety ratings with  IIHS improved. Pedestrian AEB performance of our Tesla Vision was over 45% better than performance of vision  + radar. It is no surprise that the active safety score achieved by Tesla Model 3 Euro NCAP remains an outlier. Tesla Model 3 Citroen C5 VW T-Cross Audi A1 SEAT Tarraco Skoda Octavia Mercedes GLE Subaru Forester VW Golf Lexus UX In 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot  technology (Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no  Autosteer and active safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven. By comparison,  NHTSA’s most recent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million  miles driven. For the latest quarterly accident data related to our vehicles and a description of our methodology used to collect accident data, please view  our Vehicle Safety Report. *Based on NHTSA’s most recent crash data. Tesla strives to go beyond industry standard testing by using real-world data from our fleet of over two millions  cars on the road. Historically, the aim of manufacturers has been to design their vehicles to perform well for a  suite of regulatory and consumer tests. There are too many common impact scenarios (visible in the heatmap  below) that are simply not covered by regulatory crash tests. The richness of data we are collecting enables us  to develop safety in all scenarios, not only the ones covered by regulation and ratings. We analyze data from our fleet to find solutions, which we then update via over-the-air software updates. Our  algorithm uses vehicle sensor data and, within tens of milli-seconds of impact, determines what type of impact  has occurred and triggers the seatbelt pretensioners and airbags to respond in the most optimal way down to  the millimeter and mile per hour. Tesla engineers are also in the final stages of evaluating a system which uses  Autopilot to identify when a crash is imminent. This gives Tesla vehicles an uncanny ability to predict potential  collisions and respond faster to an impact when it does occur. We use field data, data analytics and simulations to inform our design and safety engineers’ work on future  products and to send software improvements to our existing fleet via over-the-air updates. Tesla is also sharing  data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations — in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access  to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate  impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles  to protect lives. After we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of  the system once it is deployed in the real world. Since deployment of our ‘offzone’ side algorithm (data-driven  safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our  new algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet-based  learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be. In a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side  collision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision. And side sensors are usually too close to a  driver window to detect a collision far in the front. We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that  they can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary. Improving occupant safety has always been key to our mission. All our vehicles are built off a safety-first  architecture with a low center of gravity (thanks to the positioning of our battery) and enhanced frontal impact  safety (thanks to the front trunk that is void of the engine found in forward engine ICE vehicles). Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 and Model Y to be some  of the safest cars built to date, anywhere. Even though Model 3 and Model Y have no engine, their performance  is similar to a “mid-engine internal combustion car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear  motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it. Not only does this architecture add to the  overall agility and handling of the car, but it also improves stability control effectiveness by minimizing  rotational kinetic energy. After putting Model 3 and Model Y through a series of crash tests used as part of the New Car Assessment  Program to calculate the likelihood of serious bodily injury for front, side and rollover crashes, the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded each top safety ratings of 5-stars in every category  and subcategory. A hallmark of Tesla ownership is connectivity. We are an industry leader in deploying over-the-air (OTA)  software updates to our vehicles. These updates are integral to – and continuously enhance – the customer  experience, and they can include improvements to customer safety or a remedy to a recall. OTA updates can be  installed at a customer’s convenience without a trip to a Tesla Service Center. Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. Furthermore, all of Tesla’s safety features come standard  with every vehicle and our ratings are based on our standard safety equipment. At Tesla, we do not believe that safety should be optional. When the media reports a story about a vehicle fire, it is usually reporting on an EV fire. This is likely a result of  chasing clicks, rather than the prevalence of EV-related fires compared to ICE vehicle-related fires. The reality is,  when compared to Tesla vehicles, ICE vehicles catch fire at a vastly higher rate. According to the latest available  data, in 2020, there were almost 173,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone. From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By  comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation  show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled. In order to provide an apt comparison to NFPA data, Tesla’s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused  by structure fires, arson and other reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for some of the Tesla vehicle  fires over this time period. We continue to improve our battery chemistry, cell structure, battery pack structure and vehicle passive safety  in order to decrease fire risk to as close to zero as possible. As Tesla’s vehicle technology continues to improve,  fires will be even less likely for our EVs. Tesla has partnered with European and Australasian NCAPs to provide free mobile app-based emergency  response documentation for quick access to Tesla vehicle specific models. We make detailed information available to first responders so they can safely handle those emergency situations. The beauty of selling commercial storage systems such as Megapack is that purchasing such a product is almost  purely a mathematical decision for our commercial customers. If installing Megapack makes economic sense,  there is no reason not to install one. A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage  capacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh. Tesla Energy continues to be  dependent on the global supply chain, including cell supply. In 2021, in order to meet demand that is well in  excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new production facility capable of  producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year. The best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your reliance on the grid. Tesla is a one-stop shop for taking our  customers off-grid by covering a large variety of their needs. In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage  products, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*. Some of these projects were massive deployments,  including a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia. In order to switch  global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need  to increase to ~10,000 GWh. Anyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall. In theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight  alone. Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer. In Massachusetts,  for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings  within approximately 10 years. As the cost of these products continues to decline, more customers will be  willing to switch to solar and storage purely due to lower overall cost. Electrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common, predominantly due to weather and natural  disasters. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electrical disturbances cost businesses $150 billion per  year. It is not surprising that homeowners and businesses are increasingly turning to backup power supply  options. Our solar and energy storage products are a great way to reduce emissions while also ensuring backup  power during outages. We are continuously working on reducing the cost of our products in order to foster mass adoption. Ultimately,  using renewable energy (such as solar or wind) with battery storage will become the cheapest energy option  available, regardless of location. This is already the case in many, but not all, locations around the world. As the  cost continues to decline, more customers will be able to financially benefit from turning to renewable energy. *Full year figure is a Tesla estimate calculated using data from the first six months of 2021 extrapolated based on historical trends. Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. Tesla creates our products  from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers. Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their  suppliers and sub-suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery  recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain,  we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to  meet the growing demand for our products. In line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring  that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. Our goal is that where  Tesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our  purchases. Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives: 
1. Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories  (supply chain localization); and   2. Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing  communities. Upstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery – from raw material extraction through refining and  transportation of materials – can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of  the total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage. Our battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot analysis – an industry first – is on page 104 of this report. ~12 ton of rock mined Produce a battery pack Produce a battery pack Produce a battery pack A common question we receive is: “What happens to Tesla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?”  An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium-ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil  fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium-ion battery are recyclable. When petroleum is  pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere  that are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in  the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly. Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons. Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the  useful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery  efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a  customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center. Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last  many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that  Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped  lithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal  ecosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement  circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling. The small number of post-consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles  on the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest  model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some  time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes. In 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada for in- house processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries. While Tesla has worked for  years with third-party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the  importance of also building recycling capacity in-house to supplement these relationships. On-site recycling  brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight  to our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale,  allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing  of R&D products. By the end of 2021, this facility achieved a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material  per week. As the manufacturer of our in-house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to  maximize key battery material recovery. With the implementation of in-house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally. We  intend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re-introduce valuable materials back into our  manufacturing process. Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and  low environmental impact. From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the  long term as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than  purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing. A closed-loop battery recycling process presents a  compelling solution to move energy supply away from the  fossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more  circular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over  and over again. Tesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly. We do this by proactively identifying and  addressing potential risks in our supply chains. The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and  Responsible Materials Policy outline Tesla’s expectations for suppliers. Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral  Supply Chains. Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on- the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report. The next sections will detail how we undertake each of the five steps laid out above, starting with our  management system approach. Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible  sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize  these raw materials for the following reasons: 
1. Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production,  represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle  range and safety performance. 2. Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ – in that  they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often  concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves  are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in  more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified  as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are  essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the impact of  mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social  scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors. Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to  ensure mining is done in a responsible way. This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible  Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible  mining standards in our due diligence. The implementation of an OECD-aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following  two pillars: 
1. Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing  steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain  are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local  contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers  and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and  social data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel- containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding  contracts include environmental and social requirements. As Tesla’s battery supply chain continues to scale,  Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase. 2. Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the  continuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in Tesla’s supply chain,  informed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society. Tesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum  (NCA) and nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for  lower energy applications. Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and  manganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and  provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only  accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no  cobalt or nickel. While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade  chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of  responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the  foreseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these  materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary,  mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of  these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable  energy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to  enable the scale up of key battery minerals. For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of  nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell  performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important to note that  we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell  production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis. In the past year, Tesla collected environmental and social data in its cobalt, lithium and nickel supply chains  through the following main activities: 
Audits are an important tool for Tesla to gather environmental and social data for cobalt, nickel and lithium. • In 2021, 83% of refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain, including 100% of refiners and mine sites from  whom Tesla sources directly, either underwent or committed to undergo independent external sustainability  audits against one of the following sustainability and responsible mining standards: IRMA Standard, the  Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), Towards Sustainable  Mining (TSM) and/or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance Expectations. • In addition, Tesla conducted six audits in the battery supply chain tailored to Tesla’s specific environmental  and social requirements, including the OECD guidance and environmental management systems. Tesla also  has an audit program that goes beyond the battery supply chain – please see pages 112 - 115. • Tesla also reviews suppliers’ ISO14001 (environmental management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health  and safety) certification statuses. Refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s  cobalt, nickel and lithium supply  chains that we directly sourced from  underwent or have committed to  undergo independent third-party  sustainability audits 
Of all refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s  cobalt, nickel and lithium supply  chains underwent, or have committed  to undergo, independent third-party  sustainability audits Tesla used a newly developed Know-Your-Supplier (KYS) Questionnaire to map our battery supply chain and  collect information related to suppliers’ environmental and social management systems. 1 Independent external sustainability assessments included: Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), the Responsible Minerals  Initiative (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), and/or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance  Expectations, Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) 2 This column refers to LCAs conducted by the supplier (not Tesla). 3 There is currently no industry-wide 3rd party audit program for lithium refiners. In addition to the product-specific LCA described in the Environmental Impact section, Tesla also commissioned  LCA service provider Minviro to identify hotspots with high global warming potential across eight specific  processing routes from which we currently source cobalt, nickel and lithium. The hotspot analysis found that main drivers of GHG emissions depend on the different battery compositions,  processing routes and countries of origin. Overall, key drivers are the cathode and anode supply chains. Within  the cathode supply chain, the hotspots are nickel and lithium, and cobalt was only a minimal contributor. Within  the cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains, chemical processing (refining / smelting) was a larger driver than  mining. Tesla complemented the hotspot analysis with data collected during a pilot blockchain traceability project for  nickel sourced from Tesla nickel supplier, BHP, that traced nickel from a mine site in Australia to Tesla and  collected GHG emissions data for every step. The pilot project showed that mining and upstream processing  had a higher CO2e intensity than precursor, cathode and battery cell production. Building on this hotspot analysis and pilot project, Tesla developed a data collection methodology aligned with  the GHG Protocol – a globally recognized standard for measuring GHG emissions – and informed by the  European Product Environmental Footprint methodology and the Product Environmental Footprint Category  Rules (PEFCR) guidance for batteries — a set of rules developed by the European Union on calculating product- specific environmental footprint. Instead of relying on estimates or aggregate data from third parties, Tesla’s  ambition is to collect as much primary data from Tesla’s suppliers as possible to get the most accurate  understanding of GHG emissions hotspots and therefore, how to reduce emissions. Reports and grievances from NGOs and community organizations as well as media articles are other important  sources for potential environmental and social risk information. Tesla reviews allegations in detail and conducts  its own investigations, including through direct bilateral engagement with relevant suppliers and with the  parties making the allegations, to assess the severity of the risk and possibilities for risk avoidance or corrective  actions. A Tesla delegation including members of Tesla’s Responsible Sourcing Committee visited suppliers in the DRC  and Argentina. Both trips included visits to mine sites and meetings with community representatives. In the  DRC, Tesla also visited a school, an orphanage and a maternity clinic. Aside from contributing to Tesla’s  environmental and social risk assessments, the trips helped Tesla better understand local contexts and  challenges. The DRC trip provided a more nuanced view of the complex issue of artisanal and small-scale  mining (ASM) and its history within the DRC. In Argentina, the trip focused on questions related to water usage  and the use of new technologies to extract lithium in a more energy-efficient way. From all the activities listed in this section, Tesla identified six risk areas as well as cross-cutting topics in cobalt,  lithium and nickel supply chains for prioritized engagement, described in Step 3, on the next page. As a result of the activities listed in Step 2, Tesla identified the following focus areas for risk mitigation and  improvement of local conditions at or around cobalt, nickel and lithium mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain: 
Tesla reviewed • A supplier’s occupational health and safety system • A supplier’s digital system to monitor the risk of unavoidable landslides • Evidence of progress towards the elimination of safety-related incidents • Minutes from community meetings to raise awareness around safety risks related to  landslides and trespassing • A supplier’s commitment to conduct a Human Rights Risk and Impact Assessment  (HRRIA) 
Tesla reviewed • Data on water levels and water quality, including environmental surface water monitoring  sheets • Evidence that potential sources for acid leaks were decommissioned or re-engineered • Minutes from community meetings to raise awareness of potential sources of water  pollution and mitigation measures • Written assurance that water is not discharged to water sources for nearby communities 
Tesla also met with community representatives to confirm that a supplier’s usage of  freshwater does not impact communities’ water access. For another supplier, Tesla participated in the establishment of a committee of independent  environmental experts to assess and work with the supplier on environmental risk  management. Tesla reviewed • Evidence for a supplier’s government engagement in support of artisanal mine site  legalization • Evidence for investments into initiatives supporting responsible artisanal mining 
Tesla also met with representatives of artisanal mining communities and provided funding to  initiatives supporting responsible artisanal mining (see page 109). As a result of the activities listed in Step 2, Tesla identified the following focus areas for risk mitigation and  improvement of local conditions at or around cobalt, nickel and lithium mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain: 
Tesla reviewed • A supplier’s area of operation in relation to nearby forest areas • A supplier’s reforestation and rehabilitation plans • Written assurance that mining activities did not take place in rainforest areas • Environmental impact assessments 
Tesla directly engaged with representatives of communities affected by mining operations to  review that regular engagement and consultation take place and community needs are  responded to. Tesla also reviewed • Meeting minutes to ensure communities were regularly consulted • Evidence for a best-practice Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process, including  in coordination with responsible government authorities 
Tesla’s approach to GHG emissions data collection (see Graph in Step 2) is currently being  implemented. The data collected will inform the development of concrete actions to reduce  Tesla’s Scope 3 emissions. • Based on an initial review, 15 refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain disclosed that  they conducted an LCA 
Cross-cutting Across all risk areas identified, Tesla • Reviewed suppliers’ audit frameworks to ensure upcoming audits will cover all areas  identified above • 55 corrective actions agreed to with suppliers related to suppliers’ environmental and  social management processes • Expanded environmental and social requirements in supplier contracts, for example  related to responsible mining standards, LCAs, GHG emissions footprint disclosure, and  transparent and proactive risk disclosure • Developed a formal technical collaboration on sustainability with a supplier The DRC is an important source of cobalt for Tesla batteries. We will continue supporting sourcing from the  DRC provided our responsible sourcing standards are met. While Tesla does not source cobalt from Artisanal  and Small-Scale Mining (ASM), we recognize the importance of ASM for local livelihoods. This is why Tesla  provides funding to, and sits on, the Steering Committee of the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA), a multi-stakeholder  initiative to support the improvement of conditions in communities impacted by artisanal mining through the  following activities: 
• Occupational health and safety awareness raising campaign for mine workers • First aid training for mine workers and selection of safety captains • Distribution of protective equipment to washer women • Creation of savings groups for mining community members paired with financial literacy training • Development of referral system for children engaged in mining activities, including child labor notification  protocol, remediation solution packages, and guidelines for case managers on remediation steps, in  collaboration with the NGO, Save the Children • Trainings related to child rights • Electrification of five schools covering students through the distribution of solar-chargeable portable lamps • A marketplace and football field selected for the placement of lighting poles Tesla understands that many of the environmental and social issues in global EV supply chains do not concern  Tesla, alone. Tesla is actively engaging in multi-stakeholder forums and industry groups to find industry-wide  solutions to industry-wide questions: 
• Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA): Tesla joined IRMA as a Member in 2021 to support  responsible mining practices and transparent and robust audit processes that emphasize community  interviews. It is important to Tesla that NGOs and communities actively participate in third-party audits of  mines against the IRMA Standard, as their perspectives provide greater context on mining operations and the  impacts of extraction, while also increasing accountability and identifying opportunities for improvement. • Global Battery Alliance (GBA): Tesla has been involved in the GBA since 2020 and has served on the GBA  Board and Battery Passport Steering Committee since 2021. Tesla’s goal as part of the GBA is to advocate for  high standards for responsible battery materials sourcing, align with EU regulatory requirements, and  support the development of actionable guidance related to GHG emissions data collection, recycling, and in- country environmental and social projects. • Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI): Tesla is a member of the RMI to support the RMI’s refiner audit  programs and industry-wide responsible sourcing dialogue. • IFC Net Zero Roadmap Working Group: Tesla has participated in the IFC Working Group since early 2022 to  provide a downstream perspective in the development of actionable guidance for mine sites to reduce  carbon emissions. • Re|Source: Tesla participates in the supply chain-wide Re|Source consortium to pilot blockchain-supported  traceability in the cobalt supply chain. Tesla offers insights from an OEM perspective on metrics critical to  traceability efforts and works with the consortium towards the first end-to-end blockchain-enabled tracing of  cobalt material starting from Tesla’s supplier in the DRC to Gigafactory Shanghai. Tesla’s battery responsible sourcing program is still relatively new. Yet, the program has achieved several  important milestones this last year, including the development and initial implementation of a system to identify  environmental and social risks in the battery supply chain and concrete progress towards mitigation and  improving the situation of stakeholders impacted by Tesla’s battery supply chain. In 2022, Tesla plans to continue building on momentum of the program and improve on the data points shared  in this report, including the development of supply chain GHG emissions reduction plans and further projects  and investments in mining countries to have a positive environmental and social impact. Tesla will then explore  an expansion to manganese, graphite, copper and mica. In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance  evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension  was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company  gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an  increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased  responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we  focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially  dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts. We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the  basis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and  stringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety,  environmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that  are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its  implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach. In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures  require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit  where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier  audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to  improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies. As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once,  representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000  supplier employee interviews were conducted. In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit  program. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the  updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit  program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across  three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global  footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was  an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply  chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base. The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk  assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This  criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be  nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the  potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50%  of our global spend with our direct supply base. As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive  way. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans  to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In  cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that  their corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers  are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that  those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines. Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any  violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such  instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be  developed immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the  supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable  time frame. Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social  risks within our supply chain. These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures,  but also sets a baseline for future evaluations. Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential  risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below. We engaged with several third-party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for  emerging issues that may affect our suppliers. These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and  environmental degradation. This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as  information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their  plans for correcting the identified risk. Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within  our supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing  practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Our responsible sourcing policies  require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies. Furthermore,  we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as  understand industry best practices to address them. We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific  action groups within the organization. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk  analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA-Online to collect information on corporate  and factory-specific supplier performance. Across all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment of workers 
The table below details findings of our audits across all suppliers regardless of severity and includes initial  audits as well as closure audits. Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100% of priority  non-conformances, with the remaining open priority findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits. Our  initial focus on high-risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the  audit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program. In all audits conducted at Tesla's request at supplier manufacturing facilities producing Tesla products, we found  no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment. In 2021, the five most common findings were related to (% of total findings within each category)2: 1. Working Hours (20.4%): no more than 60 hours work per week, overtime is voluntary, one day off per seven  days 2. Emergency Preparedness (11.1%):  proper permitting, emergency risk assessment at 11.1% of total findings;  3. Wages and Benefits (9.4%): proper calculation of regular and overtime wages, timely payment of wages;  4. Occupational Safety (7.5%): availability of PPE, proper permitting; and  5. Freely Chosen Employment (5.5%): contract provided in worker’s native language, no excessive penalty for  leaving position  
1 Over the past two years, global pandemic conditions have significantly impacted our suppliers’ ability to schedule on-site audits, leading to a  decrease in our annual audit numbers. 2 The colors of percentages above indicate their inclusion in broader categories in the table. For example, Working Hours is a subcategory of Labor  and, therefore, both are colored blue. Introduction Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating framework  that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its  affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. 11 - 12 
Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term  focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate  governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some,  but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success. The Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating  and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each further  described in this section. 14 - 15 
Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in  our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and  measurable milestones. Tesla builds products with privacy and security at their core. Additionally, managing data privacy is a shared task  through all levels of our organization. Our privacy principles are: 1. We build privacy into our products from start  to finish; 2. We give customers choices about their data; 3. We maintain trust through transparency; and 4. We  safeguard personal data. The ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future. We  believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights. Our  human rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the values  they represent. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by  our suppliers. Introduction Tesla's employees are its greatest asset and critical to achieving our mission. Our People Strategy is centered on  providing meaningful work, a respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace, compensating our people well,  and making our benefits an outlier. 22 
Our employee count has grown ~70 fold over the past decade and, in just over ten years, created nearly 100,000  direct jobs. Whether it is through our direct hiring opportunities, internships or workforce development  programs, interest in joining Tesla’s mission is at an all-time high. We had more than 3,000,000 unique  applicants globally in 2021 alone. Tesla provides a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds the wages of comparable manufacturing roles,  even before equity and benefits are factored in, and we want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing  industry. We have an annual pay equity program in place, designed to assess whether similarly situated  employees are paid in a similar manner after accounting for a range of variables. As Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and our profitability (operating margin) has rose  to the highest in the industry, employee satisfaction has improved. This has fueled our ability to expand  dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. As nearly 70% of our leadership is  promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of successful progression. We are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities  that have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of  December 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents are people of color. This year we published our  latest EEO-1 data for the first time. Respectful Workplace We strive to create an environment where people love to come to work every day. With over 100,000  employees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on. In 2021, we re-doubled our efforts  to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be reported. 42 - 43 
Employee Engagement Employee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee  retention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while  company-wide open-door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard. 44 
We are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our disaster relief efforts have  provided 100% clean, emissions free emergency power to people in Ukraine, New Orleans after Hurricane Ida,  and Kentucky and Texas after sever winter storms. We also provided free supercharging to customers in  countries surrounding Ukraine. In 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We recently deployed  our new EHS&S system – MyEHS – in order to better collect and manage data, allowing us to make decision that  reduce risk. Furthermore, in 2021, our ATSM Global Serious Injury Rate remained below the industry average. 47 - 54 Regardless of where they are driven (U.S., Europe or China), a Model 3 and Model Y emit far fewer greenhouse  gas emissions per mile than a comparable ICE. Moving the grid toward more renewables and making our  operations and supply chain less GHG intensive will only make this dynamic more pronounced as time goes on. 56 – 67 
We have disclosed our full Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions this year. We have also disclosed the  amount of CO2e emitted through the use of our vehicles (part of Scope 3). The global Supercharger network and  home charging in California were both 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources (for the Supercharger network only) and annual renewable matching. NOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants New research shows that fossil fuels are alone responsible for more than 8 million premature deaths annually, or  almost one out of every five deaths globally, double previous estimates. Zero tailpipe emissions is a commonly  overlooked benefit of EVs. 70 
Tesla Semi's Impact on Emissions Tesla Semi is poised to make a large impact: in the U.S., combination trucks make up just 1.1% of the vehicle fleet  but account for 17.9% of annual emissions. 71 
As we continue to build new, more efficient factories our ability to limit packaging and reduce waste increases. Waste generated per vehicle in Shanghai production is 60% less than our manufacturing in the U.S. We continue  to push for innovative approaches to reducing waste as we expand our global operations. 72 
Water Used per Vehicle Manufactured Water use per vehicle produced by Tesla was again below the industry average in 2021. Our new factories such as  Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg will set a new standard when it comes to low water use per vehicle. 73 - 74 
Emissions Credits In 2021, Tesla delivered more than 2x as many EVs as our next closest competitor, helping drive $1.5bn in revenue  from selling regulatory credits. This money is being used to accelerate our production capacity deployment in  direct support of our mission. 75 Model 3 is price competitively with ICE equivalents. But, when compared on a total cost of ownership basis, the  Model 3 is much closer to a Toyota Camry on all-in cost per mile than to an ICE equivalent such as a BMW 3  Series. 77 - 78 
Product Usage & Usability Our data shows that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they  are generally being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. The superior range of our vehicles and a robust global  Supercharger Network makes this possible. 79 - 80 
Vehicle Safety At Tesla, safety features are not optional. Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle. When we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe. Our active safety features are powered by  eight cameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. 81 – 84 
In 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology  (Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no Autosteer and  active safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA’s most  recent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million miles driven. Data Driven Safety Tesla strived to go beyond industry standard testing. We leverage data from our fleet of over two million cars to  better understand accidents and build solutions around them. 86 - 87 
Passive Safety & Tesla Safety Awards Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. 88 - 89 
Fire Risk From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By  comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation  show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled. 90 
Solar + Storage Products Pairing energy storage with renewables is required to transition our grid to zero-emission sources. In 2021, in  order to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new  production facility capable of producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year. 91- 92 
Resilience of the Grid Electric grid disturbances in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 15 years. Our solar and storage  products not only deliver cost savings and energy independence, but they also harden the grid from adverse  events in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner. 93 Introduction Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. Our responsible sourcing  strategy aims to increase the share of direct procurement and continually improve local conditions of the  communities from where we source. 95 
Battery Recycling Tesla is building capacity to recycle manufacturing scrap and end of life batteries in order to close the loop on  battery raw materials. By the end of 2021, our battery recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada achieved a  production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material per week. 96 - 97 
Alignment with Best Practices Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply  Chains. This means Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into  on-the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report. 98 
We have prioritized responsible sourcing activities for cobalt, lithium and nickel given their unique significance to  EVs and energy storage. To ensure we are appropriately managing risk, we continue to map our supply chain,  conduct in third-party audits and on-the-ground engagements, and collaborate with industry initiatives to ensure  our suppliers are living up to our strict standards. In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance  evaluation to key environmental, social, and governance metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. As of the end of  2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our Suppler Audit at least once, representing 144  suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. 1 Includes all major manufacturing sites: Fremont Factory and supporting facilities, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Tesla Grand Rapids and Gigafactory Shanghai. 2 Includes major manufacturing sites dedicated to vehicle production: Fremont Factory and supporting facilities, Gigafactory Nevada Vehicle Operations, Tesla Grand Rapids and Gigafactory Shanghai. *PwC performed an attest review engagement on this metric.

*OTA designation indicates how many recalls / units were able to be satisfied using over-the-air updates. When a recall is fixed with an OTA update it obviates the need for a visit by the customer to a Tesla Service Center. In 2021, we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis to better understand the key ESG topics that were  most salient to our diverse group of stakeholders. To start, we identified over 40 issues in key areas that could  directly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic, environmental, social and  governance issues. These issues were identified from four components: (1) a competitive landscape review, (2)  interviews with investors and other key external stakeholders, (3) industry reports and documented research,  such as the World Economic Forum’s 2021 Global Risks Report and (4) external ESG frameworks relevant to our  industry and regulatory requirements across global capital markets. Tesla’s Sustainability Council refined the list of 40 key issues into a survey containing 25 questions in an effort  to help us prioritize these topics for operational management and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As  part of the assessment, we surveyed our key stakeholders, asking them to rate the identified economic and ESG  topics on a scale of 1-5, based on their perceived importance and impact to Tesla’s business. A total of 2,168  individuals from Tesla and approximately 40 external partners, including trade associations, universities,  suppliers, environmental consultants, nonprofits and local administrators, responded to the survey. 35% of  responses came from North America, 57% from China and 8% from Europe. Below are the top issues identified  by our materiality analysis, in order of importance to survey responders. 1. Environmental Management, Reducing Carbon 2. Quality Management– Product Safety 3. Employee Workplace Safety 4. Employee Attraction, Retention, Development  5. Ethical Business Conduct, Integrity, Transparency 6. Data Protection, Cybersecurity 7. Supply Chain Management, Sustainable  Materials/Products 8. Customer Satisfaction, Trust and Loyalty 9. Company Brand and Mission 10. Employee Health and Wellness 11.

Community Engagement, Economic Development Tesla believes the ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future and believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to  support our mission and share our respect for human rights. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (“UDHR”). The UDHR  focuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain – including with respect to our  employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate. Suppliers are responsible for ensuring that their employees and  contractors are provided with a safe and healthy work  environment. Tesla recognizes the value of different backgrounds and  perspectives in our workforce, and fully promotes equal  opportunity for all employees, both current and prospective. Just as we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color,  religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or  identity, national origin, disability, medical condition, military  and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or any other  characteristic protected by law, regulation or ordinance, we  require our suppliers to similarly respect the people in their  workforces. We expect our suppliers to share our goal of recognizing  environmental protection as a key principle of a sustainable  future. Tesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the  employment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no  workers at a facility or location that provides materials used in  Tesla products may be under the age of 15. Tesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the  communities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our  ability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We  expect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously  improve the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of  their operations on the local community, including with respect  to environmental, social, and other quality of life factors. The mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw  materials that go into our products has historically had an  adverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and  communities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw  material extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we  expect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate  representatives of indigenous communities and include the right  to free and informed consent in their operations. The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page: The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page: 
Suppliers are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure that  their parts and products supplied to Tesla do not contribute to  armed conflict, human rights abuses, or environmental  degradation, regardless of sourcing location. For all materials  used in Tesla products, Tesla requires its suppliers to establish  policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems  consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for  Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected  
Tesla requires suppliers to document their efforts to monitor  their supply chain for any red flags indicating the use of child or  forced labor or contribution to conflict or human rights abuses  as well as environmental impacts in the mining or processing of  these materials throughout the value chain. Suppliers must  implement due diligence programs for the value chains of these  materials and are expected to use the RMI’s reporting template  for the collection of information where such a template is  available. For all other materials, Tesla will continuously assess their sourcing for potential risks and red flags, and where any are identified  will engage with those suppliers to address any issues and require cooperation with our efforts. Suppliers are required to provide information upon request on  their sourcing, due diligence efforts and findings for all materials  included in the responsible materials policy. The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page: 
Labor Suppliers must commit to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. This applies to all  workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker. Forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary or exploitative prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons is not permitted. All workers must be  provided with a written employment agreement in their native language that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment. All work must be voluntary, and  workers shall be free to leave work at any time or terminate their employment without penalty if reasonable notice is given as per worker’s contract. Workers shall not be  required to pay employers’ agents or sub-agents’ recruitment fees or other related fees for their employment. Child labor is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing. The term “child” refers to any person under the greater of (i) the age of 15, (ii) the minimum applicable legal age  for completing compulsory education in a country, or (iii) under the minimum legal age for employment in the country. Workers under the age of 18 (Young Workers) shall not  perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, including night shifts and overtime. If child labor is identified, assistance and remediation according to the  stricter of international standards or local standards shall be provided. Working hours are not to exceed the maximum set by local law. Further, a workweek should not be more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, except in emergency or  uncommon circumstances. All overtime must be voluntary. Workers shall be allowed at least one day off every seven days, defined as a rest period of at least 24 consecutive  hours every seven days. Suppliers must keep employee working hour and pay records in accordance with local and national laws and provide records to Tesla upon request. Suppliers should be committed to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. Companies shall not engage in discrimination or harassment based on race,  color, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity or national origin, disability, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership,  covered veteran status, protected genetic information or marital status in hiring and employment practices such as wages, promotions, rewards, and access to training. Suppliers recognize that in addition to minimizing the incidence of work-related injury and illness, a safe and healthy work environment enhances the quality of products and  services, consistency of production and worker retention and morale. Suppliers also recognize that ongoing worker input and education are essential to identifying and  solving health and safety issues in the workplace 
Worker potential for exposure to health and safety hazards (chemical, electrical and other energy sources, fire, vehicles, and fall hazards, etc.) are to be identified and  assessed, mitigated using the Hierarchy of Controls, which includes eliminating the hazard, substituting processes or materials, controlling through proper design,  implementing engineering and administrative controls, preventative maintenance and safe work procedures (including lockout/tagout), and providing ongoing occupational  health and safety training. Potential emergency situations and events are to be identified and assessed, and their impact minimized by implementing emergency plans and response procedures  including emergency reporting, employee notification and evacuation procedures, worker training, and drills. Emergency plans should also include appropriate fire detection  and suppression equipment, clear and unobstructed egress, adequate exit facilities, contact information for emergency responders, and recovery plans. Worker exposure to chemical, biological, and physical agents is to be identified, evaluated, and controlled according to the Hierarchy of Controls. If any potential hazards  were identified, suppliers shall look for opportunities to eliminate and/or reduce the potential hazards. When hazards cannot be adequately controlled by such means,  workers are to be provided with and use appropriate, well maintained, personal protective equipment free of charge. Suppliers shall provide workers with appropriate workplace health and safety information and training in the language of the worker or in a language the worker can  understand for all identified workplace hazards that workers are exposed to, including but not limited to mechanical, electrical, chemical, fire, physical hazards, pathogens,  toxins, and other health related risks. The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page: 
Environment Suppliers recognize that environmental responsibility is integral to producing world-class products. Suppliers shall identify the environmental impacts and minimize adverse  effects on the community, environment, and natural resources within their manufacturing operations, while safeguarding the health and safety of the public. All required environmental permits (e.g. discharge monitoring), approvals, and registrations are to be obtained, maintained, and kept current and their operational and  reporting requirements are to be followed. Emissions and discharges of pollutants and generation of waste are to be minimized or eliminated at the source or by practices such as adding pollution control equipment;  modifying production, maintenance, and facility processes; or by other means. Suppliers are to establish a greenhouse gas (“GHG”) data or all products and related services supplied to Tesla upon request. Energy consumption and all relevant Scopes 1  and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (using the GHG protocol) are to be tracked, documented, and publicly reported. Where such tracking is not currently available Suppliers  should establish a plan to implement tracking within one-year and provide the data and/or components required to calculate GHG emissions. Ethics To meet social responsibilities and to achieve success in the marketplace, Suppliers and their agents are to uphold the highest standards of ethics. Business Integrity The highest standards of integrity are to be upheld in all business interactions. Suppliers shall have a zero-tolerance policy to prohibit any and all forms of bribery, corruption,  extortion, and embezzlement. All business dealings should be transparently performed and accurately reflected on the Supplier’s business books and records. Information regarding Supplier’s labor, health  and safety, environmental practices, business activities, structure, financial situation, and performance is to be disclosed in accordance with applicable regulations and  prevailing industry practices. Falsification of records or misrepresentation of conditions or practices in the supply chain are unacceptable. Programs that ensure the confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of supplier and employee whistleblowers are to be maintained, unless prohibited by law. Suppliers should  have a communicated process for their personnel to be able to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation. Suppliers shall adopt a policy and exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the cobalt, tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold in the products they manufacture  to reasonably assure that they are sourced in a way consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance for Responsible Supply  Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas or an equivalent and recognized due diligence framework. The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page: 
Suppliers shall adopt or establish a management system with a scope that is related to the content of the Code of Conduct. The management system shall be designed to  ensure: (a) compliance with applicable laws, regulations and customer requirements related to the Supplier’s operations and products; (b) conformance with this Code; and  (c) identification and mitigation of operational risks related to this Code. It should also facilitate continual improvement. Corporate social and environmental responsibility policy statements affirming Supplier’s commitment to compliance and continual improvement, endorsed by executive  management, and posted in the facility in the local language. A process to identify the legal compliance, environmental, health and safety labor practice and ethics risks associated with Supplier’s operations. Determination of the relative  significance for each risk and implementation of appropriate procedural and physical controls to control the identified risks and ensure regulatory compliance. Ongoing processes, including an effective grievance mechanism, to assess workers’ understanding of and obtain feedback on or violations against practices and conditions  covered by this Code and to foster continuous improvement. Workers must be given a safe environment to provide grievance and feedback without fear of reprisal or  retaliation. Suppliers must periodically provide workers with information on all grievance procedures. No retaliation against workers for raising workplace concerns may be  tolerated, including personal attacks, intimidation, or other threats against workers. Corrective Action  Process A process for timely correction of deficiencies identified by internal or external assessments, inspections, investigations, and reviews. Managing a successful and effective Impact program requires robust engagement with an entire ecosystem of  stakeholders – both internal and external to Tesla – including our employees, customers, investors, suppliers,  non-profit organizations, educational institutions, governments, the communities in which we operate and trade  associations. These groups, among others, all have a stake in the success of our businesses — they are people or  organizations who are affected by or can impact our operations. For our business to continue to grow, we need  to keep innovating, developing new products and markets all in a sustainable manner. We do this by attracting  and retaining the best employees, serving our customers and investors and working with non-profits, our local  communities, schools, governments and trade associations to make a positive impact. - Technological innovation in manufacturing - Development of zero-emission technologies - Reduction of carbon emissions from transport and energy generation - Increase renewable energy generation - Further improve product affordability and accessibility

In 2015, the United Nations defined a blueprint of 17 sustainable development goals to meet the urgent  environmental, political and economic challenges facing our world. We understand that companies can play a  critical role in providing solutions to these challenges. Our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to  sustainable energy directly addresses some of these challenges — our products and services have helped to  create industry demand for sustainable energy products. In 2021, as part of our Impact program, we reviewed the issues and topics most material to Tesla (identified on  page 126) and key areas of focus for the Company and mapped them to the most relevant Sustainable  Development Goals: Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of total automotive emissions  (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. OEM sustainability reports 
Analysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual  mileage. For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low  as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17  years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken  together, even before considering the impacts of using real-world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this  leads to a drastic under-reporting of Scope 3 emissions. To estimate CO2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven by our vehicles and kWh of electricity  generated and stored by our solar panels and energy storage products at the state, province, and country level for  2021. We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity  generated), for each state, province, and country to estimate CO2e avoided. For miles driven, the emissions savings  factor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real-world fuel efficiency rating of ~24  mpg. The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes  upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels. Figures based on actual electricity consumption from utility bills for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 2020 and 2021  figures also include measured consumption for on-site fuel use including propane, diesel and gasoline. Figures for  2012-2017 for electricity, and 2012-2019 for on-site fuel use, are estimated based on actuals scaled for vehicle and  battery production for each respective year and facility. Land Use Data Source: Food and Agriculture  Organization of the United Nations. FAO  2020, FAOSTAT Emissions Database. Latest  update: 2020. Accessed: June 2021.  https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg- emissions. For simplicity, select categories were combined based on similarity of emissions source. Emissions from Agriculture  were combined with emissions from Land-Use Change and Forestry under the label “Agriculture, Land-Use Change  and Forestry.” Emissions from Industrial Processes were combined with emissions from  Manufacturing/Construction under the label “Industry.” Emissions from Waste, Fugitive Emissions, Other Fuel  Combustion and Bunker Fuels (U.S.-only) were combined under the label “Other Energy.” 
Figures for peer benchmarking were sourced from the latest available EEO-1 disclosure on each company’s website. For comparability, all figures were converted to percentages of total workforce. Figures for each Tech and  Automotive industry were calculated based on an average of the percentages for the companies in each respective  industry. Tables on pages 37 and 38 represent the difference in representation in Tesla’s workforce across each  category. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions (location-based) are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting  company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Emissions from the use of a company’s products are  included in Scope 3. 6,500 miles At the moment, the manufacturing process of a Model 3 results in slightly higher  GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle. However, based on  the global weighted average grid mix, a Model 3 has lower lifetime emissions than an  equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles. Tesla estimate 
Estimate is based on the difference in CO2e emissions from the average of manufacturing phase of a Model 3 and  Model Y and an equivalent ICE which is then divided by the net CO2e savings per mile from a Model 3 and Model Y  versus an equivalent ICE. Net CO2e savings are based on delivery-weighted global grid mix. 70 tons: Lifetime CO2 emitted by an average combustion engine vehicle (model year  2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase, excluding CO2 emitted during the oil  refining phase. Tesla estimate based on the EPA 2021  Automotive Trends Report 
Figure based on EPA's real-world (5-cycle) testing result of 25.3 MPG across all manufacturers for model year 2021,  which equates to 348gCO2/mi, and 200,000 lifetime miles. Excludes CO2 emitted during fuel production and  transportation. Note: the EPA's real-world testing cycle is not the same as owner-reported MPG sourced from Consumer Reports. In order to estimate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprints (GWP100) of select benchmark vehicles, a simplified  approach of multiplying their curb weights by a carbon intensity of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg was chosen. This reference  value is based on a currently produced mid-size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of  this estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of  the reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different  geographies and suppliers. As such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average  premium mid-size ICE vehicle. Based on past work on automotive LCAs (Rohde-Brandenburger & Koffler, 2019)  (Koffler C. 873 , 2013) (Koffler C. , 2010) (Koffler C. , Krinke, Schebek, & Buchgeister, 2008) (Koffler C. , 2007), the  uncertainty of these estimates is estimated to be less than ±20% for a cradle-to-gate system boundary, and  therefore less than ±5% once the use-phase is added. The reference manufacturer’s Environmental Certificates are calculated using the same BOM import functionality of  the GaBi DfX software used for the Model 3 in the LCA authored by Sphera as well as GaBi 878 databases for all  background data. Benchmark mid-size premium ICE vehicles include BMW 330i 2.0, Audi A4 2.0, Mercedes-Benz C300 2.0, Alfa  Romeo Giulia 2.0, Volvo S60 2.0, Cadillac ATS 2.0, Lexus IS 300 2.0 and Infiniti Q50 2.0. Benchmark cross-over SUV premium ICE vehicles include BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Jaguar F-Pace, AR  Stelvio, Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Porsche Macan. Figured based on owner-reported fuel economy from Consumer Reports for the latest available model year (2018- 2020, depending on the make/model). 24.8 MPG is representative of the average of Alfa Romeo Giulia , Audi A4,  BMW 330i, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes-Benz C300, and Volvo S60. use-phase GWP100 of  ~400 gCO2e/mi includes gasoline production and distribution emissions from GaBi 2019 databases as well as  consideration of bio-fuel mix of gasoline in the U.S. (~12%). Figure inclusive of: raw and semi-finished material production including transportation, mechanical processing and  shaping, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly and paint shop, all fuels and energy (natural gas, electricity, etc. ),  other auxiliaries (lubricants, water, etc.) and end-of-life disposal. Figure exclusive of: capital goods (e.g., machinery, buildings), infrastructure (e.g., roads, power transmission  systems), employee commute, external charging equipment and infrastructure, maintenance and service during use,  packaging, transport to recycler, disposal of manufacturing waste, inbound transportation from Tier 1 suppliers,  distribution to customers. Excluded activities are estimated to represent minor contributions to the cradle-to-gate  as well as the overall LCA results. Where solar and storage are assumed to be a fuel source for the use-phase of the Model 3Y, emissions were  included in the manufacturing phase figure. The Model 3Y Rideshare Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 100%  of these emissions on a per mile basis, while the Model 3Y Personal Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 82% of  these emissions and 18% grid-charged emissions on a per mile basis (based on observed supercharging vs. other  split). Use-phase emissions for grid charging are based on Model 3 and Model Y delivery-weighted state, province and  country level grid mix based on grid carbon intensity data. U.S. Source: U.S. Department of Energy | E.U. + EFTA Source: IEA | China Source: China Electricity Council's China  Power Industry Annual Report 2021 Use-phase emissions calculated using the geographic distribution of the Model 3 and Model Y in each respective  region based on Tesla's delivery data, which weights state, province and country level carbon intensity figures and  assumes no change in grid mix into the future. This is a conservative assumption based on recent new electricity  generation capacity trends and commitments made by states and countries to increase renewable mix on their  respective grids. Grid emission intensities include upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels. Real-world observed efficiency of Model 3 and Model Y over ~30 billion miles, inclusive of energy losses from grid  to battery, utilized for use-phase emissions calculations (converting gCO2e/kWh to gCO2e/mi). To calculate scrappage age of vehicles in a region, sum up annual vehicle sales from the most current year going  back until the sum equals the current vehicle parc size. In order to be conservative, and normalize our figure based  on recent vehicle sales trends in each region, we divided total vehicle parc by average vehicles sales in the  respective regions for 2019 and 2020 (latest available data). This resulted in a scrappage age of 17 years and  200,000 miles in the U.S. and 20 years and 150,000 miles for Europe. For simplicity, China assumed to have similar  useful life to Europe of approximately 20 years and 150,000 miles.

Because as significant as  COVID-19 is, it’s not the only challenge our world faces. Climate change presents environmental, social, and  economic crises on a whole new level. For nearly two  millennia humans have been carbonizing our planet and  we need to act together to decarbonize. Our first annual sustainability report, released in January  2021, showed early progress on our commitments to  become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste  company by 2030 and protect ecosystems by building  a Planetary Computer. 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our  goals, with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope  2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased year  over year, due in substantial part to significant global  datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and  usage as a result of the pandemic. During our most recent fiscal year, we grew business  revenue by 20 percent while continuing to reduce our  operational emissions, as represented by Scope 1 and 2  combined, with a decrease of approximately 17 percent  through our purchasing of renewable energy. However, as our business has grown and we’ve seen  increased use of our devices and cloud services, our  total Scope 3 emissions (comprising the company’s  entire value chain) have increased by about 23 percent  year-over-year. These emissions include, among other  things, the carbon emitted from electricity generation to  power devices at home or at work and for producing the  concrete and steel we use in construction. We work to limit these emissions when we design and  manufacture our products, and work with our suppliers  to report and reduce their emissions—but still saw an  increase. This serves as an important reminder that Scope  3 emissions are the most difficult to control and reduce. This year has highlighted the challenges of reducing  Scope 3 emissions and we’re committed to sharing our  learnings to help other organizations who are wrestling  with these same challenges. One Scope 3 category that saw an annual increase  was capital equipment. This category includes the  emissions to produce equipment we bought this year  (and will use for a long time) as well as the carbon  emissions associated with the construction of new  buildings including both datacenters and office space. For example, as the Microsoft Cloud business expands,  construction of new datacenters and new server  equipment is needed to support growing customer  demand. The emissions associated with the capital  equipment category accounted for about 30 percent  of our Scope 3 total this year. Another Scope 3 category that saw an increase was the  use of our products, specifically the estimated emissions  associated with powering products we sold including  Xbox and Surface devices. This category accounted for  about 29 percent of our Scope 3 total this year. Around the world, the electricity used to power devices  today largely comes from grids reliant on carbon- intensive sources such as coal or gas, so Microsoft must  account for that carbon for the lifetime of our devices  to accurately track our Scope 3 emissions. And, because  every part of the world has a different mix of electricity  generation sources, we calculate a device’s climate  impact based on where the device was sold. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we remain dedicated to  building a world better than the one we found, and to  helping our customers and partners achieve the same. The impact of this work will not all be felt immediately,  and our experience this year highlights a few takeaways  relevant to many organizations executing against their  sustainability commitments. 1. Progress won’t always be linear. The rate at which  we can implement emissions reductions is dependent  on many factors that can fluctuate over time, ranging  from our own business growth and supplier mix  to the rate of growth of green infrastructure, such  as the supply of and transition speed to renewable  energy. Additionally, different sources of emissions  will be addressed on different time frames as climate  technologies and renewable alternatives advance. And as measurement methodologies improve and  new standards emerge, companies like ours may see  emissions rise or fall year-over-year. Nonetheless, the challenge remains: we must  continuously improve on our efforts to decouple our  emissions from our growth until we reach our carbon  negative commitment in 2030. Some of this will happen  through the completion of specific goals such as our  shift to a 100 percent electric campus vehicle fleet, our  move away from diesel fuel as a backup energy source  for our datacenters, and the carbon benefits of our  waste reduction improvements due to our expanding  fleet of Circular Centers. Other progress will happen  through the expansion of our renewable energy  purchasing program to cover the energy consumption  of our consumer devices, through advances by our  suppliers in reducing their own emissions, and through  increased purchasing of new materials as they enter the  markets, including green steel, low carbon concrete,  and other infrastructure components of a future net  zero carbon economy. 2. Progress relies on us all counting carbon consistently. There are several external factors or bugs in the world’s net zero carbon program that if addressed will help us all make greater progress toward our net zero goals. The world lacks a common meaning of the term net zero and a common unit of measurement for assessing the climate impact of various net zero approaches, and we must all focus on maturing the markets needed to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050. We explored these topics in greater detail through the lens of our work on carbon removal. We will continue to innovate and invest to meet our  ambitious commitments and we’ll do so in a principled  way. We will also continue to be transparent about our  progress, our challenges, and our learnings to help  others on their journey. As we look to the future we are  committed to:  
• Counting everything, including challenging Scope 3 emissions. We are putting programs in place to help lower them, from working with our suppliers to help them decarbonize to continuing to innovate with our company-wide internal carbon tax to incentivize emissions reduction and continuing to invest in carbon removal. • Only investing in carbon removal offsets instead of traditional avoided emissions offsets because removal is an underdeveloped and critical tool to solve the world’s climate challenge. You can only get to net zero when you’ve reduced all that you can and your remaining carbon emissions are completely balanced by long-term carbon removal. Last year, we made the world’s largest purchase of carbon removal at 1.4 million metric tons and in this fiscal year we are on track to top that by procuring 1.5 million metric tons. While 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we’ve  also made some great progress that we share in more  detail in this report. A few examples that illuminate the  diversity of our work include the following. • Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified, with new certifications for the San Antonio, Texas and Quincy, Washington datacenters and renewed certifications for our Boydton, Virginia and Dublin, Ireland locations. • We announced the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to provide comprehensive, integrated, and automated sustainability management for organizations at any stage of the sustainability journey. • Through an investment from our Climate Innovation Fund, we’re helping LanzaJet complete their sustainable fuels plant in Georgia—a move that will help decarbonize our datacenters as well as the airline industry. • While overall device emissions grew because of higher sales and usage, we reduced the carbon footprint for several of our products. Surface Pro 8 is one of the most energy efficient Surface Pros ever and we introduced Energy Saver, a new low-power standby mode for Xbox consoles. • We granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions the world needs to reach net-zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel. With net zero becoming the new normal—more than  1,500 companies with total net revenue of $11.4 trillion  have pledged that they will become carbon neutral or  net zero—the world must move from climate pledges to  climate progress. As a leading technology provider of sustainable  solutions, Microsoft stands ready to support our  customers, partners, and the world in the move towards  
a net zero, environmentally sustainable future. And while  the shape of what the future holds is unknown, we  will continue to build the foundations needed today  and do the work that needs to be done to deliver on  our commitments. Allocated $471 million to date via our  Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate  our carbon goals, as well as water and  waste. We also donated $100 million to  Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst initiative. In FY21, Microsoft invested in  replenishment projects that are expected  to generate over 1.3 million cubic meters  of volumetric benefits. We have planned five Circular Centers, with  Amsterdam open, construction underway  in Boydton, Virginia, and three more to be  added in 2022. In FY21, we signed new power purchase  agreements (PPAs) for approximately  5.8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy  across 10 countries around the globe. In FY21, we diverted more than 15,200 metric  tons of solid waste otherwise headed to  landfills and incinerators. The Planetary Computer private preview  released as planned in April 2021, with more  than 500 users signed up and using the APIs  and scalable compute. Through our partnership with Water.org,  we provided more than 95,000 10 people  with access to safe water or sanitation. We have made available 24 petabytes of  data with more than 30 key environmental  and Earth observation datasets to Azure  in consistent, analysis-ready format that is  freely available for use by anyone. In 2021, Microsoft was awarded the U.S.  Water Prize for Outstanding Private Sector  Organization for adopting our water positive  program and committing to being water  positive by 2030. Since its inception in 2017, our AI for Earth  program has provided more than 850 grants  to organizations working in 110 countries  around the world, granting more than  $20 million in Azure credits. Hold everyone  accountable for  progress and a  governance structure  to track progress  in real time  
Microsoft’s commitments to become  carbon negative, water positive, and  zero waste by 2030 while building a  Planetary Computer are well known. To guide the progress across the company on those  goals, we have changed the way our sustainability  strategy and accountabilities are set and how progress  is evaluated. In the interest of transparency and also to  help other organizations get started, we are sharing how  we work first, prior to our commitments and progress on  them—sustainable digital transformations require both  strategic frameworks and cultural buy-in to be successful. The best available science and policy indicate that every  organization needs to do even more in far less time than  previously thought. As we saw the science in 2019, it was  clear that our carbon neutral goal was not what the world  needed—the world needs to reach net zero by or before  2050. That meant we needed to set goals aligned to the  science and language of the science, and we needed to be  more ambitious. In 2020, we made a series of environmental  sustainability commitments, including being carbon  negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. At Microsoft, we think about the positions of influence  that we can use. We start by taking accountability for our  operations as a company, but we expand this significantly  as we think about the different roles that we play as a  customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate,  and partner in innovation to customers, organizations,  and institutions around the world. The challenge is to  find where our organization can have the most impact  across our positions of influence. Microsoft looked at our commitments based on our  operational footprint across carbon, water, waste, and  ecosystems, the technology that we provide to our  customers and partners to power their sustainability  initiatives, and larger influence that we can have on the  world with research, investments, strategic partnerships,  and policy and advocacy. Sustainability is no longer just a corporate social  responsibility (CSR) function or a way to mitigate  risk—it must be mainstreamed into every part of the  business. That starts with making sustainability part of  the brand commitment and embraced by all leaders. At the heart of our culture is the understanding that for  Microsoft to do well, we need the world to do well and  that we are a company that pursues profit by solving  the problems of people and the planet. This belief is  deeply held by the leadership of Microsoft—the CEO,  CFO, and President—the entire company sees the  commitment and it sets the tone across the company  that sustainability is at the core of our business. Corporate commitments give your company a north  star, but you need to embed the strategy and build  operational commitments across your business. At Microsoft, we knew we needed a way to implement  and execute on our strategy across the entire company,  in every business group. For each focus area (carbon,  water, waste, and ecosystems), we set commitments in  each business group and developed roadmaps to reach  these commitments. We are also committed to enabling  our suppliers with capacity-building tools and resources,  as well as sustainable supply chain financing. Hold everyone accountable for  progress and a governance structure  to track progress in real time  
Governance and accountability are critical to ensuring  alignment and prioritization across your business. At Microsoft, we hold our business groups accountable  for their carbon emissions via an internal carbon fee of  $15 per metric ton. In January 2021, we expanded the  carbon fee so that it includes Scope 3 emissions from  our supply and value chain, in addition to Scope 1 and  Scope 2. We set measurements and scorecards for each  business group’s sustainability commitments across the  company and review progress twice a year. We have  established a Climate Council that includes senior  business leaders from every business group to provide  sustainability advice, collaborate, drive alignment,  prioritize resources and funding, and review progress on  our commitments. We also tie a portion of our executive  incentive plan to our carbon reduction goals. If the world is going to meet net zero goals by 2050,  companies need to use their entire ecosystem and all  of their positions of influence. In addition to taking  accountability for our operational footprint across  carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems, Microsoft is  deploying capital, supporting innovation, and advocating  for larger policy change. We led the largest corporate  carbon removal RFP last year, spending our dollars to  drive the carbon removal market forward and to address  our own needs. Our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund is investing in  organizations across our areas of commitment to build  a larger, more robust ecosystem of effective companies  and solutions. Our sponsorship at COP26 and numerous  engagements with governments at the city, regional,  state, and national levels are aimed at creating policy  environments that further accelerate the impact of this  work and the transition to net zero. Transparency is both embedded in each step and a  specific commitment. In this report, as well as other  white papers, methodology papers, and speaking  engagements, Microsoft is committed to sharing our  learnings with the world. When things go well, we will  share that as well as the playbooks to follow to achieve  similar results outside our organization. And if things  go less well, we will share that too so we can all learn  and grow together. We are also delivering innovative  technology and services to help our customers and  partners power environmental sustainability. And we go  beyond that with our biggest bets in policy, investment,  catalytic partnerships, and research and development. We recognize that our employees  are the most important asset and  resource in advancing innovation  in sustainability and are creating  opportunities for them to contribute  to our efforts. At Microsoft, empowering our global workforce is the  center of our sustainability strategy. Both Microsoft  and LinkedIn have employee communities who drive  bottom-up sustainability initiatives to educate, inspire,  and activate every employee to advance the company’s  sustainability goals. The Microsoft Sustainability  Connected Community is an employee-led group  of 5,000 members and 32 regional chapters whose  mission is to make sustainability part of everybody’s  job. The LinkedIn Go Green sustainability engagement  program includes one out of every eight employees and  its 26 chapters are focused on empowering employees  to take green action at home, in the office, and in their  communities. Both groups engage employees on our  sustainability commitments while using Microsoft and  LinkedIn technology to innovate real-world solutions to  the climate crisis through the following activities. Microsoft and LinkedIn employees participated in virtual  Ecochallenges for three weeks around Earth Day 2021 to  gamify personal sustainability. Seven thousand people  prepared 31,000 meatless or vegan meals, saved 197,000  pounds of CO2, diverted 227,000 plastic containers and  bottles from landfill, saved 392,000 gallons of water, and  spent 239,000 minutes learning about sustainability. Run an ecochallenge to give your employees the  opportunity to learn and practice habits that support  them on their personal sustainability journey. Microsoft employees self-organize into working groups  all year long and “hack for sustainability” by partnering  with each other to create innovative solutions to real- world environmental challenges. In 2020, Microsoft had  125 projects with 879 participants, and 93 percent of  participants indicated their interest in continuing the  work beyond the Hackathon. One award-winning project  from the Microsoft Global Hackathon, Soil as a Service,  created a way to lower the cost of measuring organic  carbon in soil using a sensor hooked up to Microsoft  Azure IoT. This innovative solution lowers the cost of  measurement significantly, incentivizing farmers to  change their land management practices and helping  nascent carbon marketplaces to quantify their impact. The project has been picked up by a business group for  further research and exploration. The Microsoft Garage provides a platform for  hackathons and ideathons all year long, including  our month-long Sustainability Ideathon for Earth  Day 2021 and the year-round Sustainability program  using our HackBox platform for employees to collect  ideas, share concepts, create projects, form teams, and  inspire colleagues globally to participate in Microsoft’s  sustainability journey. Employees from every facet of Microsoft and LinkedIn  are empowered to lead collaborative cross-company  sustainability projects at any time. This year, our platform  has facilitated 200 projects from more than 1,000  employee “hackers,” with projects ranging from digital  foresting, to smart bird feeders, to building software that  will help retrofit the world’s coal power plant fleet with  modular nuclear reactors. The Sustainability Community not only helps Microsoft  lower its own operational carbon and waste footprint,  but also creates a way to share these best practices  with external organizations so they can do the same. A Microsoft employee noticed a gap in our internal  processes: as customers migrate from on-premises IT  assets to the cloud (Azure), the on-premises hardware,  like servers and racks, becomes e-waste, which can  create serious environmental hazards if it’s not properly  disposed of. The issue was raised to the Azure leadership  through the community, and a new resource was  developed to guide customers on how to ensure the  sustainable, secure, and compliant disposition of IT  assets. This guide is being used by our Azure Migrate  & Modernize Program (AMMP) customers, through  which 20,000 virtual machines and 2,000 databases  have been migrated. In October 2021, we launched the Sustainability in Action  badge. This is the first all-employee learning course  focused on sustainability, with four hours of content on  carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. Within the first  two months, more than 3,000 employees completed  the course, and can serve as sustainability champions  in their daily work as well as personal lives. In April 2021, to celebrate the 51 st anniversary of  Earth Day, the Microsoft Sustainability Community  organized three days of learning sessions to educate,  inspire, and activate employees on the importance  of sustainability. Volunteers coordinated more than  40 sessions and generated 30 hours of evergreen  
learning content covering topics from green software  engineering to how to live a zero waste lifestyle at  home. More than 3,600 people from 56 countries  participated. LinkedIn celebrated Earth Day with over  61 global experiences and participation from nearly  2,900 employees at the virtual events. Microsoft is committed to be a  carbon negative company by 2030. To achieve this, we are improving  efficiency in our operations, devices,  and supply chain; we are delivering  technology to help our customers  measure and manage their carbon  emissions more effectively; and we  are breaking new ground with carbon  removal purchases and investments  to help develop the crucial, nascent  carbon reduction market. Carbon negative  By 2030, we will be carbon negative, and by 2050,  we will remove our historical emissions since we  were founded in 1975. Reduce direct emissions  We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near  zero by 2025 through energy efficiency work and  by reaching 100 percent renewable energy. Replace with 100/100/0 carbon free energy  By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption  will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases  100 percent of the time. Reduce value chain emissions  By 2030, we will reduce our Scope 3 emissions by  more than half from a 2020 baseline. Remove the rest of our emissions  By 2030, we will remove more carbon than we emit. By 2050, we΄ll remove an equivalent amount of  carbon to all our historical emissions. Microsoft is committed to be a water  positive company by 2030. To achieve  this, we will continue our water  stewardship work across our operations,  building on the steps taken to reduce  the water consumption in our  datacenters and campuses over the  past decade. In addition to reductions,  we aim to become water positive  through expanding access to clean  water and replenishment projects. Water positive  By 2030, we will replenish more water than we use. We will reduce the water intensity of our direct  operations and replenish in water-stressed regions  where we work. Reduce water waste in datacenter operations  By 2024, we will reduce water waste in our datacenter  operations by 95 percent. Increase access to water  We will provide 1.5 million more people with access  to clean water and sanitization services. Microsoft is committed to be a water  positive company by 2030. To achieve  this, we will continue our water  stewardship work across our operations,  building on the steps taken to reduce  the water consumption in our  datacenters and campuses over the  past decade. In addition to reductions,  we aim to become water positive  through expanding access to clean  water and replenishment projects. Microsoft is committed to become  a zero waste company by 2030. We are taking an increasingly circular  approach to materials management  to reduce waste and carbon emissions. Our approach includes design and  material selection, responsibly  sourcing materials for our operations,  products, and packaging, and  increasing the use of recycled content. We keep products and materials in  use longer through reuse, repair,  and recycling programs. Increase reuse of servers and  components through Circular Centers  By 2025, 90 percent of servers and components within  our regional datacenter networks will be reused. Eliminate single-use plastic  By 2025, we will eliminate single-use plastics in all  Microsoft primary product packaging and all IT asset  packaging in our datacenters. Make fully recyclable products and packaging  By 2030, we will design Surface devices, Xbox products  and accessories, and all Microsoft product packaging  to be 100 percent recyclable in OECD countries. Drive to zero waste operations  By 2030, we will achieve 90 percent diversion of  operational waste at datacenters and campuses  and 75 percent diversion for all construction and  deconstruction projects. Microsoft is committed to protect  more land than we use by 2025 while  also building a Planetary Computer. We need a strong, efficient, scalable  way to monitor, understand, measure,  and ultimately manage the impact  of our actions or inactions on  ecosystems—both globally and  locally. Microsoft is well on our way  to providing access to the world’s  critical environmental datasets and  delivering a computing platform to  measure, monitor, model, and manage  healthy ecosystems. Build a Planetary Computer  We will aggregate environmental data from around  the world and put it to work through computing  and machine learning in a new Planetary Computer. Take responsibility for our land footprint  We will take responsibility for the ecosystem impacts  of our direct operations by protecting more land than  we use by 2025. A key principle of our work is transparency. This report, published annually, includes our  strategy, progress against our goals, and key  challenges and trends we see in this work. We  also publish our environmental data, which is  included in Appendix D. Deloitte & Touche LLP  performed a review relating to specified  information within Section 1 of Appendix D.  We continue our work to provide leading  transparency, visibility, and reliability in our  non-financial reporting. We think about Microsoft’s approach to  sustainability in layers of increasing impact  and have structured this report accordingly in  chapters across our commitments in carbon,  water, waste, and ecosystems. Each chapter  follows this approach, as outlined here and  on the following page. We start with taking accountability for our  own operational footprint, which is relatively  small. For example, we account for less than  .03 percent of carbon emissions globally. We then look at how Microsoft technology  can help our customers and partners power  their environmental sustainability. Endnotes are used throughout the report;  all references are hyperlinked and a full text  explanation of all endnotes can be found in  Appendix C. An explanation of why this program is  a focus, what our commitments are, and  what our progress and accomplishments  were for the past year. A look at our approach to reduce, replace, or  remove our footprint across how our products  and facilities are sourced, manufactured,  operated, and managed at end of life. In each building at every campus and datacenter, sustainability  is a key priority for Microsoft across all phases of a project—  from site selection to design and construction to operations  and decommissioning. Sustainability in our devices means looking at the impact  that we have on our planet as we design, manufacture, and  ship our devices, software, games, and operating systems,  as well as product usage and end of life. Our operational commitments extend into our supply  chain. We work with our suppliers to report their  emissions, design plans and new approaches to reduce  their emissions, and track progress over time. A review of the latest innovations from  Microsoft to help our customers and partners  power environmental sustainability through  our learnings, technology, and services. A look at how we’re driving global change  with our biggest bets in policy, investment,  catalytic partnerships, and research  and development. A recap of key trends we’ve observed this  year, what’s coming next for Microsoft,  and resources for organizations on their  sustainability journeys. “The key to addressing  climate change at a company  like Microsoft is to partner  with every industry to  understand how it functions,  discern the elements vital to  its success, share and adapt  solutions, and help our  customers chart an informed  path to decarbonization.” The consequences of climate change are increasingly  apparent, from wildfires to devastating flooding. The scientific reality of climate change is more accepted  than ever before—to avert the worst effects of the  rapidly changing climate, the world needs to transition  to a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050. But we still lack key strategies to avoid catastrophic  climate change. The world needs agreement on the meaning of global  net zero emissions, measurement to track our progress  toward net zero, and mature markets for carbon  reduction and removal that are necessary to get us there. Through our operations, technology, and advocacy,  Microsoft is addressing these three areas to help drive  the change that society needs. Our strategy to reach carbon negative by 2030 is  relatively simple—we will reduce our Scope 1 and 2  emissions to near zero by improving efficiency, adopting  new solutions, and purchasing zero carbon energy. 1  
We are engaging suppliers and our business groups to  cut our Scope 3 emissions by more than 50 percent and  we’ll rely on carbon removal to reach carbon negative. This year, we took strides forward on zero carbon energy,  continued progress on carbon removal, and improved  our methodologies and measurement of emissions data  across the company. We will continue to further refine  how we measure and approach these categories as we  move forward. We also took new steps to accelerate  the work of others via the launch of a new solution, the  Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, to help our customers  measure their carbon emissions more effectively, and  created resources to help decarbonize our supply chain. and by 2050 to remove from the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide our  company has emitted either directly or by our electricity consumption since we were founded in 1975. We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to  near zero by the middle of the decade through  energy efficiency work and reaching 100 percent  renewable energy by 2025. By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption  will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases  100 percent of the time. By 2030, Microsoft will remove more carbon  than it emits. By 2050, we΄ll remove an equivalent  amount of carbon to all our historical emissions. We will help our suppliers, customers, and partners  around the world to reduce their carbon footprints  through our learnings and with the power of data,  AI, and digital technology. We have created a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund to  accelerate the global development of carbon reduction  and removal technologies, as well as related climate  solutions to reduce water and waste. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market- based) emissions by 58,654 metric tons of  carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2) in FY21. Scope 3 emissions increased by 22.7 percent. In FY21, we signed new power purchase  agreements (PPAs) for approximately  5.8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy  across 10 countries around the globe, totaling  more than 8 GW of renewable energy via  PPAs or long-term contracts. We released a set of in-depth capacity- building tools and resources, developed  in partnership with ENGIE Impact, WSP,  and CDP to help companies, especially  our suppliers, report their greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions and set strategies  to reduce emissions from electricity. In July 2021, 87 percent of our in-scope  suppliers reported their emissions to CDP,  up 12 percent from 2020. This data informs  suppliers’ baselines for reduction targets and  gives Microsoft a more accurate picture of its  Scope 3 emissions. Following the CDP cycle,  Microsoft built out action plans with suppliers  to assess and report emission reductions  through 2030. In FY21 and FY22, Microsoft successfully  contracted to remove 2.5 million mtCO2,  meeting our cumulative two-year goal. This includes 1.4 million mtCO2  2 contracted  in FY21 and 1.1 million mtCO2 contracted  to date in FY22, on path to meet our goal  of 1.5 million mtCO2 in FY22. Allocated $471 million to date via our  Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate  our carbon goals, as well as water and  waste. We also donated $100 million to  Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst initiative. In July 2021, we launched the Microsoft  Cloud for Sustainability to provide  comprehensive, integrated, and automated  sustainability management for organizations  at any stage of the sustainability journey. While overall device and console use phase  emissions grew as a result of higher sales and  usage during the pandemic, we reduced the  carbon footprint for several products and  usage scenarios:  
• The new Surface Laptop Studio has a 30 percent smaller carbon footprint than its predecessor, the Surface Book 3 13”. 3 Carbon negative  by 2030  A company is carbon  negative when it  removes more carbon  than it emits each year. In FY21 we procured the removal of 1.4 million metric tons of carbon as one of our initial steps towards achieving  our 2030 commitment. a. Chart has been updated to reflect latest actual values which incorporate latest methodology and structural change  adjustments. A portion of the 1.4 million metric tons of removal will apply to future years. b. Overall increase in emissions is driven mainly by the growth of our cloud services business and an increase in sales  and usage of our devices. In FY21, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by 16.9 percent. We saw an increase in Scope 3  emissions driven by growth of our cloud services business and an increase in sales and usage of our devices. Scope 3 represents the majority of Microsoft’s emissions, and we are committed to reducing these emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030. Tracking and reporting against this  category of emissions is critical for net zero progress. a. Scope 2 and 3 values are market-based. b. Overall increase in emissions is driven mainly by the growth in the categories  of purchased goods and services, capital goods, and use of sold products. In FY21, we signed new  PPAs for approximately   5.8 GW of renewable  energy across 10 countries  around the globe, totaling  more than 8 GW of  renewable energy via PPAs  or long-term contracts. It is critical that companies take a  rigorous approach to achieving net  zero. This begins with recording and  reporting emissions with better data  collection and automation, reducing  emissions as much as possible,  replacing electricity consumption  with renewables, and removing  the remaining emissions. In January 2020, Microsoft announced its intention to  be carbon negative, which will see us cut our greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions across our operations to nearly  zero and by over half by 2030 across our value chain  with improvements in energy efficiency, replacing  with renewable energy for Scope 2, and removing  the remainder of emissions. We will also remove the  equivalent amount of our historical carbon emissions  by 2050. Implementing these commitments is a journey. At Microsoft, we have come to see this as a “5-R Journey”  that begins with recording and reporting emissions with  better data collection and automation, then reducing as  much as possible with that data-informed roadmap first,  then replacing fossil fuels in our electricity consumption  with renewables, and finally removing what remains. Our total company emissions (market-based) in 2021  were approximately 14 million mtCO2. Of this total,  about 120,000 mtCO2 were Scope 1 emissions at  Microsoft datacenters and campuses. Taking into  account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 2  emissions were approximately 160,000 mtCO2. The bulk  of our emissions—more than 97 percent—are in Scope 3,  which includes emissions from our supply chain, the  lifecycle of our hardware products and devices, travel,  and other indirect sources. While our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions  decreased this year, we did see an increase in Scope 3  emissions, driven mainly by the growth of our cloud  services business and an increase in sales and usage  of our devices. We are committed to cutting our GHG emissions by  over half by 2030 across our value chain, removing  the residual emissions, and removing the equivalent  amount of our historical carbon emissions by 2050. It is critical that companies take a rigorous approach to achieving net zero. We have come to see this as a “5-R Journey”. In each building at every campus and datacenter,  sustainability is a key priority for Microsoft across all  phases of a project—from site selection to design  and construction to operations and decommissioning. By the middle of the decade, we are committed to  reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero. Ensuring our campuses and datacenters are energy  efficient is a key first step in reducing our emissions. We are changing the way we build and operate facilities,  using all-electric efficient system designs like the use  of geothermal energy and thermal energy recovery,  and improving the efficiency of our cloud. Examples include the exhaust that comes  from the vehicles on your campus, natural gas  that your buildings directly consume, and the  generators you might run. This is by far the largest category of emissions  and covers all parts of your value chain (upstream  and downstream). Upstream examples include  supply chain, materials in buildings, business  travel, and manufacturing. Downstream examples  include the electricity customers consume using  your products. We are pursuing Zero Carbon certification for  our Silicon Valley campus and Redmond campus  modernization project with International Living  Futures Institute. We have committed to certifying our  Microsoft datacenters and major offices to LEED Gold  or Platinum—with a focus on the categories of energy  and atmosphere, water efficiency, materials and waste,  location and transportation, sustainable sites, and indoor  environmental conditions. Four of our datacenters  are LEED Gold certified and 74 projects are going  through certification. Microsoft is using Bonsai, a low-code AI platform that is  part of the Autonomous Systems suite from Microsoft,  to improve the efficiency of its Redmond campus chiller  plants. These chiller plants provide the air conditioning  within an HVAC system and typically represent a  substantial portion of the energy footprint of buildings. We have seen a 12 percent increase in median efficiency  based on energy estimates and plan to implement Bonsai  in the 12 remaining chiller plants this fiscal year. In the  past, energy conservation measures (ECM) projects took  more than 12 months. Bonsai enabled us to build a model  and test recommendations in two to four weeks with  comparable results. All future datacenters will be LEED Gold certified with  emphasis on water and energy conservation. All lighting  is high-efficiency LED with motion detection to minimize  use of space light. Cooling systems are integrated with  the servers, providing cooling only when the servers  require it. At the Bengaluru Cosmo office site, we installed an  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with flywheel to store  kinetic energy to provide backup power without the  need for lead acid batteries typically used in conventional  UPS. The UPS flywheel has the additional benefit of  avoiding thousands of metric tons of carbon emissions  over its 20-year lifecycle and avoiding 1,500 lead acid  batteries treated as hazardous waste at end-of-life. We are piloting new approaches that lower the carbon  footprint of our code as well as large-scale workloads for  Microsoft and our customers’ benefit. We piloted a new  feature called Start/Stop VMs, which can automatically  turn off VMs during idle hours. Our engineers have  also created more transparency inside Azure Machine  Learning, displaying resource metrics (including GPU  energy, utilization, and computational cost) to help data  practitioners assess and mitigate the hidden costs of  their machine learning workloads, and partnered with  the Allen Institute for AI to develop a set of best practices  and tools in this space. We developed the Carbon Aware  Core, which helps schedule workloads in times and  regions with the lowest carbon footprint, which is being  piloted by Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Research and will  be provided as an open-source toolkit through the Green  Software Foundation. Engineers are also testing and  deploying novel approaches like Kubernetes Scheduler  to take advantage of grid-level fluctuations in carbon  intensity to minimize carbon. By 2025, we expect to power our datacenters and  facilities with 100 percent additional, new renewable  energy generation that matches our electricity  consumption on an annual basis. Already, we’ve contracted for more than 8 GW of  renewable energy. In addition to these purchases,  we’re using our campuses as living laboratories for  energy innovation. We have installed on-site renewables at select campuses  as well. At our Silicon Valley campus, a solar panel  system will offset energy consumption up to 15 percent. Our Beijing and Shanghai Zizhu campuses have made  similar efforts, installing photovoltaic (PV) solar panels  on empty roof space in FY20 which are expected to  generate 15,450 MWh of electricity over the next  25 years to power the campus. LinkedIn’s new campus in  Omaha features an on-site solar array over the parking  structure. The system has an estimated annual output  of approximately 750,000 kWh/year of electricity,  equivalent to about 15 percent of all site energy usage,  and is being integrated with on-site battery storage to  help reduce peak demand and address any intermittent  excess solar generation produced by the array. In 2021, we unveiled our plans for a new, hyper-efficient  thermal energy center for our Puget Sound campus,  which utilizes geothermal wells to heat and cool our  buildings—resulting in a 50 percent reduction in energy  usage compared to the typical utility plant. In our Silicon  Valley campus, thermal energy storage tanks will support  the closed loop water system that provides all heating  and cooling needs for the campus. We are leaving no stones unturned in our quest to reach  net zero. We are eliminating our dependency on diesel  fuel at our datacenters, electrifying our campus fleet,  and moving to all electric kitchens. Cloud providers around the world rely on diesel-powered  generators for backup power to support continuous  datacenter operations. Microsoft has committed to be  diesel-free by 2030. Innovations include the following. Renewable fuels: Our datacenter region in Sweden  will be one of Microsoft’s first sites to use lower-carbon  renewable fuel for backup power. The datacenter’s  generators run on Preem Evolution Diesel Plus, the  world’s first Nordic Eco-labelled fuel, which contains at  least 50 percent renewable raw material, and nearly an  equivalent reduction in net carbon dioxide emissions  compared with standard fossil diesel blends. This solution  is being expanded to other datacenters across the world  with other suppliers. Batteries as backup power: We are assessing the  long-term feasibility of deploying large batteries as  backup power for critical infrastructure via our strategic  collaboration with TOTAL and are continuing research  and development in this area. We are also implementing  an extended battery solution for datacenters that  operate on highly reliable grids. Our Swedish campuses  are slated to pilot a battery energy storage system (BESS)  solution to remove reliance on generators. Hydrogen fuel cells: We are also piloting hydrogen  fuel cells as viable green energy for backup power at  our datacenters. We announced a worldwide first in  2020—hydrogen fuel cells powering a row of datacenter  servers for 48 consecutive hours. This successful pilot  provided a proof of concept for supporting backup  power needs that could be implemented once batteries  reach their capacity. Our primary power supply to an  operating datacenter is now a hydrogen fuel cell. We are committed to fully electrifying our global campus  operations vehicle fleet of over 1,800 vehicles by 2030. Since announcing this target, we have spent the last  year developing regionally specific implementation  strategies, analyzing the vehicles, and determining the  infrastructure needed to support operations. In the  coming year, we will launch a series of pilots appropriate  to each region to keep us on track to goal. In our Puget Sound campus modernization project,  we have removed natural gas from campus, including  cooking over 15,000 meals a day with only renewable  electricity. LinkedIn’s updated design and build  guidelines call for all-electric kitchens powered by  renewable energy, designed to cook over 5,000 meals  a day on clean power. Our commitment is that by 2030,  100 percent of Microsoft’s energy  supply, 100 percent of the time, will  come from carbon-free resources. This commitment completes the link  between carbon-free resources and  our facilities in both space and time. Hourly renewable supply and demand matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for a decarbonized grid. The vast majority of Microsoft’s direct carbon emissions  footprint comes from electricity, and as such, our work  on carbon reduction has centered on using less of it,  while at the same time ensuring we support the  adoption of more carbon-free energy in the grids  where we operate. While our goal has remained  consistent—to get to an energy supply that is entirely  carbon-free—our approach has evolved as the supply  of renewable energy has increased, markets have  matured, and data has become more granular. Our initial commitment, set in 2012, was to cover  100 percent of our energy consumption with renewable  energy certificates (RECs). We achieved our goal that  same year by purchasing enough RECs to cover our  annual energy consumption. However, a REC purchase  is not always a direct contract with new renewable  generation and does not always mean that the  renewable generation is on the same grid as where  we are consuming electrons. Put simply, pursuing  “unbundled” RECs de-linked energy production and  consumption in both geography and time, reducing  the overall impact. Recognizing the importance of linking our renewable  purchases to new impactful and additional renewable  energy projects, Microsoft began engaging in  renewable energy procurement through power purchase  agreements (PPAs). PPAs are a direct contractual  relationship between a purchaser and a supplier for  new renewable energy via a project or several projects;  that is, the execution of the PPA provides the necessary  revenue stream for new renewable energy projects to  be built. The direct contract establishes greater investor  confidence in renewable projects and paves the way for  more renewable generation on the grid. We formalized our commitment to procuring energy  from new impactful renewable energy projects in 2016  and updated it in 2020. In 2016, Microsoft announced a  commitment to increasing proportion of PPA purchases,  on a path towards 100 percent renewable energy. We pledged to procure enough renewable energy to  offset 50 percent of our energy consumption by 2018  and 60 percent in the next decade, and further specified  that we’d aim to secure new renewable energy in the  geography where our offices and datacenters are,  bringing a stronger geographic connection between our  contracted renewables and our electricity consumption. In 2020, as part of our carbon negative announcements,  we committed to bring our commitment up to 100  percent by 2025. Like our earlier commitments, this was  on an annual basis, requiring us to sign renewable energy  offtake agreements to cover our energy needs; simply put,  we will match every electron we consume on an annual  basis with renewable energy. While we are proud of this progress, the global shift to  net zero carbon energy is not happening quickly enough. The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that  the path to net zero emissions is very narrow and will  require the deployment of all available clean energy  technologies between now and 2030. For solar power,  it is equivalent to installing the world’s largest solar  park roughly every day. 4 This reality is due to the fact  that most electrons flowing onto grids today come  from carbon-intensive sources, requiring large-scale  replacement to meet our energy needs. Currently,  energy storage is not deployed at scale, and the grid  infrastructure of today is old and inadequate to meet  the balancing needs of new renewable energy resources  and the integration of net zero carbon resources, nor  to the increasing consumption demands of a rapidly  electrifying society. That is why we set a new 100/100/0 goal in 2021. Our commitment is that by 2030, 100 percent of  Microsoft’s energy supply, 100 percent of the time,  will come from zero carbon resources on grids where  we operate. The 100/100/0 commitment completes  the link between zero carbon resources and our  facilities in both space and time. Our 100/100/0 commitment provides a vision and  roadmap to pair our operational goals with our  research, technologies, and investments to drive  global change. We are bringing new research to  bear, including a white paper authored by RMI  that highlights the potential for hourly energy  monitoring tools to provide transparency into supply  and demand for zero carbon energy. The paper  illustrates that hourly renewable supply and demand  matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for  a decarbonized grid. The impact of our 100/100/0 commitment will be  significant. Matching zero carbon resources in both  space and time will reduce Microsoft’s emissions to  zero at all times and also bring benefits to the broader  grid since the zero carbon resources we contract  for will also be available to serve the grid when our  consumption is lower or zero carbon energy output is  higher. Moreover, we will be driving early deployment  of advanced resources like hydrogen and long- duration storage to fill in the gaps when renewable  energy sources are not generating. And finally, the  energy transition will affect all and needs to benefit  all, which is why we have built climate equity into our  purchasing commitments. Our renewable and zero carbon commitments to date  are having real-world impact. Microsoft is one of the  largest purchasers of renewable energy in the world. Across 2020 and the first part of 2021, Microsoft signed  
new purchase agreements for approximately 6 GW of  renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe. This includes over 35 individual deals, with 15 of those  deals in Europe spanning Denmark, Sweden, Spain, the  United Kingdom, and Ireland. This latest procurement  brings our operating and contracted renewable energy  projects to 7.8 GW globally and we are positioned to  continue to grow our renewable resource portfolio. In addition to these PPAs, Microsoft partnered with Volt  Energy, the only national African American owned solar  development company, for a 250-MW portfolio of solar  projects with the intent to create new opportunities for  under-resourced communities and to help support a  more diverse renewable energy industry. This builds on  our progress on our community purchasing and skilling  work with Sol Systems, which began a year ago. We’re also taking our learnings from our operational  work and building new products to help accelerate  global decarbonization. For example, our research led  to the co-creation and adoption of the first commercial  round-the-clock hourly energy-matching solution with  our utility partner Vattenfall. Building on this work,  we’re announcing a new around-the-clock pilot in the  Netherlands with energy provider Eneco and FlexiDAO,  a technology supplier, which will match one of our  Amsterdam datacenter’s hourly energy consumption  with the Dutch offshore windfarm Borssele. We know that our actions alone will not decarbonize the  grids, but we are committed to taking ambitious action  to drive market demand signals that will influence the  speed and scale at which the transformation happens. As Microsoft builds the tools and markets to meet our  zero carbon commitments, we are mindful of the need  for products, purchases, and policy that will enable a  carbon-free energy system for all. “Every net zero scenario shares a  common, and essential, element: a  massive increase in electrification. Electricity holds the promise of  wiping out vast sections of the global  emissions portfolio, but this only  happens if the electrons supplying  the electricity are generated from  zero carbon energy sources.” We are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions  by more than half by 2030. While we do not have direct  control over most emissions in the Scope 3 category  because they are generated by third parties, they  represent more than 97 percent of our total emissions. Our carbon negative commitment includes reducing  these emissions and removing what we cannot reduce,  which we do through a reduction strategy in campuses  and datacenters, rethinking the design of our devices,  and engaging with our supply chain. This year, we saw  an increase in Scope 3 emissions, driven mainly by the  growth of our cloud services business and an increase  in the sales and usage of our devices. Changing the way we work begins with measuring our  impact on the planet. This includes looking at embodied  carbon in each material that goes into our buildings,  as well as the future of how we work, travel, and think  about events. We’re committed to reducing not just operational  carbon but also embodied carbon—the carbon emitted  during the manufacture and transport of building  materials—which accounts for at least 11 percent of  global emissions and has historically been harder to  track and reduce. We have taken a number of steps  to address and lower our carbon footprint. We are committed to reducing our  Scope 3 emissions by more than  half by 2030. We will achieve this  through reduction strategies in  campuses and datacenters,  rethinking design of our devices,  and engaging with our supply chain. Microsoft partnered with other industry leaders to  create a new open-source, Azure-hosted tool, the  Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), to  track the embodied carbon of the raw building materials. We used the EC3 tool in designing 17 new buildings  (3 million square feet) in our Puget Sound campus  modernization project, where we are on track to reduce  embodied carbon emissions by at least 30 percent. We are now using the EC3 tool around the world in both  our campuses and our datacenters to track and reduce  embodied carbon and have found opportunities to  reduce concrete and steel embodied carbon by 30 to 60  percent in our datacenters. 5  
Microsoft and our general contractors are creating  a baseline for construction process emissions, which  include transportation of materials to the construction  site and construction installation. To date, there has  been little data and no established, industry-consistent  methodology for creating a baseline, making it difficult  for design teams to know if their emissions are better or  worse than a typical construction project. We piloted the  tracking of construction activity emissions in our Puget  Sound campus modernization project, starting with the  demolition phase (including site excavation), as well as  how much water we used. We are innovating and investing in low-carbon building  materials across our global campuses and datacenters  with the aim to achieve net zero embodied carbon,  including the following. Mass timber: At our Silicon Valley campus, we are using  mass timber, resulting in the largest mass timber building  in the United States. In addition to using this lower  carbon building material, we elected to keep two of the  existing buildings on the site, providing 36 percent of the  new campus footprint and accounting for a 28.6 percent  reduction in total embodied carbon. 5 With two floors  of mass timber, the embodied carbon savings increases  to approximately 36 percent with an estimated total  of 372 kg CO2e per square meter. 5 With over 345,000  square feet, or 2,400 tons, of 100 percent Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC) certified mass timber, the  wood reflects biophilic principles and a reduced carbon  mission. We continue to incorporate mass timber on our  campuses and are now testing the suitability of mass  timber in datacenter environments and investigating  sites to pilot these new materials. Cement: Cement accounts for approximately 8 percent  of global emissions. We are testing and piloting low- GHG cement innovations like CarbonCure to reduce  the carbon footprint of our buildings. LinkedIn is using  low-carbon and carbon-sequestering concrete mixes  for our new Silicon Valley headquarters and is now using  these materials in our LinkedIn Dublin campus. In our  datacenters, we are reducing how much cement we use  by utilizing longer 56-day cure times in lieu of typical  28-day cure times. We are also specifying the use of  cement replacement products such as fly ash and slag  that reduce the carbon footprint of concrete. Low-carbon materials: We also completed research  on low-carbon materials in collaboration with Carbon  Leadership Forum (CLF), a nonprofit industry academic  organization at the University of Washington. The research explores six low-carbon materials—earthen  slabs, non-Portland cement concrete slabs, algae-grown  bricks/panels, mycelium (mushroom) structural tubes,  purpose-grown fiber, and agricultural waste panels—  that can help reduce carbon emissions and change the  climate profile of building constructions. We are piloting  the use of these materials for our datacenters. We are innovating and investing in  low-carbon building materials across  our global campuses and datacenters  with the aim to achieve net zero  embodied carbon. Although emissions related to business travel  represented less than 5 percent of our total emissions,  we know that we can have a larger impact with our  investments and partnerships. We have made two  investments in SAF with airline partners KLM and  Alaska. This year, we expanded this work by becoming  a founding member in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers  
Alliance (SABA) and participating in the World Economic  Forum’s “Clean Skies for Tomorrow.” We are actively  supporting the development of an SAF certificate which  will set GHG accounting standards for the use of SAF to  reduce emissions by both customers and airlines in the  future. We are also looking to reduce emissions in other  areas where our learnings in SAF can be applied, from  freight and logistics to the fuel used in our datacenter  backup generators. Over the past year, devices became even more essential  as they kept us connected, working, and learning  through the pandemic. This year, higher-than-anticipated  demand translated to higher sales and greater usage,  which caused our absolute emissions to grow. We are  committed to reducing the carbon intensity of our  devices and our efforts have also grown this year. We have made significant investments to expand our  data-driven lifecycle assessment (LCA) and telemetry  approach to better measure, inform, and prioritize top  reduction opportunities to reduce our device carbon  intensity across the full lifecycle of our devices. These efforts include carbon-conscious design, reducing  supply chain emissions, innovating energy-efficient  hardware and software in use, and enabling product  repairability, reusability, and recyclability. This will allow  us to deliver the best product experience with lower  carbon intensity, while also partnering with our users to  minimize carbon footprint when using our products. In 2020, we began working on a platform to allow  engineers to make real-time design and material  selection decisions based on carbon impact, a key  enabler in modeling and reducing our future device  emissions. To generate our device carbon footprints,  we conduct LCAs in accordance with ISO 14040 and  ISO 14044 which enable us to estimate emissions from  manufacturing our devices down to the individual  component level. Further, we are upgrading our audit  management sourcing tool to ensure supplier carbon  reduction initiatives are fully reflected in these product  carbon footprints. We pair this with improved product  usage and distribution data. For example, the most  recent iterations of the Xbox Series X|S have improved  our awareness of full ecosystem energy usage from  consoles, information which is critical to future energy  efficiency improvements and emissions reductions. These investments allow us more control over our  product emissions across their full lifecycle. As informed by our LCAs, a significant lever in product  development is the engineering of low-carbon design  alternatives, such as using recycled materials and  designing for a smaller manufacturing footprint. We designed our Surface Laptop Studio to allow for  “stamping,” a lower-waste manufacturing technique  that reduced our aluminum scrap rate for the product’s  base by at least 25 percent, a key contributor to an  overall product carbon reduction of 30 percent versus  its predecessor, the Surface Book 3 13”. 6  
We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing  scrap in aluminum production, allowing us to use lower- carbon, 100 percent post-industrial recycled closed  loop aluminum for future Surface computer housings. For neodymium in magnets, a rare earth material, we are  also exploring post-industrial scrap as a manufacturing  feedstock, enabling us to produce 100 percent recycled  neodymium in magnets for future products. In our labs, we are working to engineer a lower-carbon  and reduced-waste flax-based wiring board and  experimenting with 3D printing; we have started to  explore 100 percent post-industrial recycled tin in our  soldering paste; and we are aiming to reduce overall  materials needed through new spacing guidelines that  can shrink our circuit boards in size by up to 25 percent. Reduction in total carbon  emissions of 30 percent  for Surface Laptop Studio  versus its predecessor,  Surface Book 3 13”. Microsoft is an active member in the Global Logistics  Emissions Council (GLEC), an industry collaboration  through Smart Freight Centre, committing to  reducing logistics emissions through sustainable  freight initiatives. Microsoft uses this framework to  calculate and measure the carbon impact of its Scope 3  transportation emissions. 7  
For shipping, we have an intelligent platform to measure  our emissions impact down to individual shipments,  and a carbon emissions budget has been developed  utilizing the same methodology. In our distribution  network, this year we finished a complete conversion of  our primary distribution center in Europe to 100 percent  renewable energy. This facility now generates 1.3 million  kWh from solar energy and avoids 690 mtCO2 annually. Through FY22 we will plan to convert our US distribution  centers to 100 percent renewable energy through solar  panel installations and using green renewable sources. We are also building more sustainable shipping options,  such as the delivery option launched in December 2021 to  avoid higher-carbon air freight, to give customers a choice  of more sustainable options when ordering from Microsoft. For Microsoft devices, energy efficiency is a balance of  hardware and software innovation. This year, overall  device and console use phase emissions grew as a result  of higher sales and usage from customers reliant on  these products during the pandemic. That being said,  several of our newest products launched in 2021 were  designed to be the most energy efficient devices in their  product lines, including the Surface Pro 8 and Surface  Laptop 4 running Windows 11. The most recent iterations  of the Xbox Series X|S have improved our awareness of  full ecosystem energy usage from consoles, information  which is critical to future energy efficiency improvements  and emissions reductions. Software design can also increase efficiency. We are  focused on offering low-emissions usage options such as  Energy-saving mode on Xbox, which can reduce power  usage during standby mode from 15 W down to 0.5–2 W,  as well as Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will be powered by  Azure datacenters running on 100% renewable energy  by 2025. With the release of energy-saving mode, we  are updating the initial bootup experience for users to  provide clear messaging to enable user understanding  of power modes, while encouraging them to implement  energy-saving mode on their consoles. This will be  paired with a reduction in idle and shutdown timers to  continue to improve power consumption during console  idle periods. To increase transparency for customers and stakeholders,  we publish LCA results for our Xbox consoles and Surface  devices. The LCA results are contained in our Ecoprofiles,  along with information about the product’s material  composition, energy consumption, packaging, ecolabels,  product recycling, and other environmental attributes. We have also developed a new, dynamic way for  commercial customers to gain insight into the  carbon footprint of their entire Surface device fleets. The Microsoft Surface Emissions Estimator enables sellers  to work with customers and estimate the carbon impact  of the Surface devices and key accessories they purchase  from us. In July 2020, Microsoft added additional sustainability  requirements to its Supplier Code of Conduct to support  the company’s bold carbon ambitions. This new language  requires suppliers to disclose their own carbon footprints  and develop plans to reduce them. Microsoft has spent  the past year rolling out these requirements to a subset  of its suppliers and building a program to support them. In July 2021, 87 percent of Microsoft’s in-scope suppliers  reported their emissions to CDP, up 12 percent from  2020. Following the closure of the CDP cycle, we worked  with suppliers to build action plans of emission reduction  activities leading up to 2030. This included educational  webinars and one-on-one meetings with suppliers to  dive into their individual footprints and discuss relevant  reduction levers. Microsoft also provided suppliers with  resources to aid in their reduction efforts. We continue to  believe that for Microsoft to reach our reduction goals,  collaboration with suppliers is fundamental and we look  forward to continuing the journey together. In 2021, we released a set of in-depth  capacity-building tools and resources  to help our suppliers report their  GHG emissions, develop clean energy  strategies, and reduce their energy- related emissions. When Microsoft rolled out emission reporting and  reduction requirements in our Supplier Code of Conduct,  the top feedback from suppliers was the need for simple  yet comprehensive resources to walk them through the  carbon accounting process. In response, we released a  set of in-depth capacity-building tools and resources,  developed in partnership with ENGIE Impact, WSP, and  CDP to help companies, and particularly our suppliers,  report their GHG emissions, develop clean energy  strategies, and reduce their energy-related emissions. In September 2021, LinkedIn released a new course,  Fundamentals of Sustainable Supply Chain Management,  to help organizations and professionals more effectively  engage with their suppliers. Based on our engagements with suppliers, we knew  more technical resources were necessary but insufficient  to drive change. Our suppliers need access to new  forms of finance to invest in new solutions. This year,  we launched a new partnership with the International  Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank  Group. IFC will work with designated Microsoft suppliers  in emerging markets, starting in Asia, to identify  technical solutions reducing GHG emissions, provide  implementation assistance, and offer financing solutions  to help them make investments in more efficient and  low-carbon operations. We have taken a first-of-a-kind approach towards  designing and implementing Circular Centers in  our datacenter campuses, aligning our end-of-life  dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across  the entire supply chain. From sustainable design at  the start of an asset lifecycle to sustainable sourcing,  
manufacturing, delivery, and use, towards a diversified  approach after decommissioning, this integrated  plan ensures that assets are dispositioned to optimize  value, security, compliance, and sustainability. Over the  past year, we have engaged with new suppliers who  are able to remanufacture assets and components,  effectively enabling new lifecycles for our assets. We have successfully demonstrated takeback/buyback  models with our original asset suppliers, closing the  loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or  reuse assets and components, resulting in significant  sustainability outcomes for emissions reduction and  material recovery. Our Circular Center program will  enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter computing  assets, significantly contributing to our goal of reducing  emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030. In FY21, our  overall reuse of assets was 78 percent. As we outline in Chapter 4 of our Responsible Sourcing  2021 Report, we are executing an ambitious plan to  empower all strategic device suppliers to commit to  science-based carbon reduction activities specifically  targeted to reduce emissions associated with hardware  manufacturing. We have used LCAs to prioritize supplier  categories that contribute the greatest emissions as well  as the types of actions suppliers can take to make the  biggest shifts in decarbonization, including powering  their operations with renewable energy, increasing  process and energy efficiencies, and reducing material  use and waste onsite. In January 2021, Microsoft announced that we had made  the world’s largest purchase of carbon removal in history. Our focus on removals instead of avoided emissions  offsets is aligned to our carbon negative commitment but  is also motivated by what climate science tells us is needed  to reach net zero—specifically the IPCC’s projection that  the planet could need as much as 10 gigatons of carbon  dioxide removal by mid-century, depending on the scale  and pace of decarbonization. With our purchases as well  as our investments, we are working to help build this new  market with integrity and quality. It hasn’t been easy. As we documented in our September  2021 Nature article, high-quality carbon removal is scarce  for three reasons. First, there is not a clear common  definition of net zero and the role that removals play in  net zero goals. Second, removals are not well accounted  for in the practice of carbon measurement, which itself  is still evolving. And third, the removal market is very  young, especially for truly permanent carbon removal,  which is prohibitively expensive. We know that we’re among the early entities to do  homework on this topic, and that’s why we are committed  to sharing lessons learned, as documented in our 2021  white paper and high-quality removal criteria. We are  actively working with our Climate Innovation Fund to  invest in promising carbon removal companies. We have  contributed comments to policy frameworks that set the  standards for carbon removal, such as a carbon removal  certification program by the European Commission, and  efforts by the United States federal government (both  the Department of Agriculture and the Department of  Energy) to specify high-quality removal. And we continue  to evolve our own removal portfolio mix to be a balance  of low-durability and high-durability volumes. In our first year, we chose projects that will help meet our commitment while  supporting innovation in the market, including the following. Taking Root’s CommuniTree reforestation in Nicaragua —the largest such project in the country—partners  with farming families to help develop sustainable  livelihoods by growing native tree species on marginal  farmland. The United Nations and the European Union  have used this project as a model for reforestation. We invested in a portfolio from Puro.earth Oy,  including from Carbon Cycle, Carbofex, and ECHO2,  small operations in Germany, Finland, and Australia  that use biomass residue (for example, wood chips  and forest waste) to sequester carbon dioxide in  biochar for use in soil amendment and other products. We are actively working with our Climate Innovation  Fund to invest in promising carbon removal companies  and projects. Climeworks’ Orca direct air capture  plant in Iceland removes carbon dioxide from the  atmosphere and stores it permanently underground  using a mineralization technology developed by the  Icelandic company Carbfix. Our FY22 aspiration was even larger, aiming for  1.5 million mtCO2. We launched a new request for  proposals in July 2021, seeking the highest quality  of projects on the market, both nature-based and  engineered. We are on a path to fulfilling that goal,  with 1.1 million mtCO2 contracted to date in FY22. Looking ahead, we know that the market needs to  improve the quality of carbon removal accounting,  and that we need to have a clearer line of sight to  affordable supply. That’s why in 2021 we undertook  the following projects. • In partnership with Carbon Direct, we published our  carbon dioxide removal guidance. These criteria are  our minimal viable specifications for the most common  project types that we will consider for procurement. We will continue to expand on our criteria as the  market adapts and see this as part of our market  development work. • We funded research by CarbonPlan to produce their  lessons learned and analysis from a systematic review  of 14 protocols for soil carbon offsets for buyers from  projects in the voluntary market today. • We commissioned a report from Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory on likely carbon removal supply  and cost projections for 2030, which will be available in  Q1 of 2022. • We collaborated with researchers from the University  of Vermont, University of Minnesota, Concordia  University, and Simon Fraser University to develop and  explore the climate implications of temporary carbon  storage in nature as a means to inform our carbon  removal strategies. • We co-founded the Business Alliance for Scaling  Climate Solutions and the carbon removal workgroup  of the World Economic Forum’s Alliance of CEO  Climate Leaders. Microsoft and our partners have been  investing in technologies across every  industry and region to help companies  face new and shifting market conditions. The rapid pace of this transformation  has the potential to change the world  for the better. The world’s climate experts agree that people,  companies, industries, and nations must take urgent  action to reduce carbon emissions. Reducing carbon  emissions and addressing environmental equity  require collective measures to understand and mitigate  environmental impacts. Organizations need to be able to record their  environmental footprint, report to stakeholders, reduce  their resource usage, remove their footprint through  carbon offsets or recycling, and replace high-footprint  resources with low-footprint ones. Microsoft is leading new product innovations for the  benefit of our planet. With new offerings ranging  from providing transparency on the footprint of  our devices and services, to digital supply chains  that improve business processes and reduce carbon  footprints, to IoT sensors streaming real-time telemetry  for predictive analytics, there is no shortage of  examples of how technology can enable ambitious  sustainability outcomes. Microsoft launched the Microsoft Cloud for  Sustainability in July 2021. The Microsoft Cloud for  Sustainability provides comprehensive, integrated,  and automated sustainability management for  organizations at any stage of the sustainability  journey. It is designed to streamline the process for  organizations to collect data, analyze data, and turn  
data into insights. Companies can more effectively  record, report, and reduce emissions on a path to net  zero, and we plan to support water and waste tracking  in the future. Since the announcement, we’ve brought  the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability into a public  preview period, with several customers using it to guide  their sustainability strategies. Microsoft is also serving  as “customer one,” shaping product requirements  and beginning to adopt this for our own  emissions reporting. While the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability may be  the first standalone sustainability-focused product at  Microsoft, it’s not our first work on emissions tracking  and reporting. For more than two years, we have  pioneered tools and features to provide a close to real- time view of our products’ footprint, and we continue to  deliver more transparency to customers. The Emissions Impact Dashboard provides customers  with transparency into their carbon emissions resulting  from their cloud usage, making Microsoft the only cloud provider to provide full transparency to customers  across all three scopes of emissions. Using AI and  advanced analytics, the Emissions Impact Dashboard  shows reduction trends for customer cloud usage over  time, providing the ability to forecast cloud emissions  and simplify carbon reporting. It uses consistent and  accurate carbon accounting to quantify the impact of  Microsoft cloud services on customers’ environmental  footprint and can compile the information into reports  for voluntary or statutory reporting requirements. This solution became generally available in Q3 2021. The Microsoft Surface Emissions Estimator is a new,  dynamic way for commercial customers to gain insight  into the carbon footprint of their entire Surface device  fleets. The Estimator uses state-of-the-art carbon  assessment technologies to enable customers to get  more accurate estimations of the carbon impact of  the Surface devices they purchase from us. Taking the  customer on a journey through a Surface product’s  lifecycle, the Estimator provides a visual indication of  
improvements over previous product models, highlights  some of the changes made to reduce carbon emissions,  and estimates carbon reductions associated with  deployments of new Surface models. Customers can  learn more about the impact of Surface products  on their Scope 2 and 3 emissions from the Microsoft  support team, who started to use the Estimator to  provide reports to commercial customers in late 2021. The Microsoft Teams Carbon Avoidance Screen posts  a remote meeting summary of avoided carbon based on  the distance between the organizer and the participant. The goal is to encourage people to use Teams’ remote  capabilities rather than travel for meetings. This will pilot  with a few select customers in 2022. For Windows energy usage, we are co-innovating with  third parties to help inform customers about the carbon  footprint associated with their computing. One partner,  elow (formerly CSN Energy), was able to reduce  use-phase carbon emissions up to 6 percent through a  co-innovated elow Carbon App by providing guidance  to users to charge their computers based on the real- time carbon intensity of the electric grid. Another, AVOB,  provides more accurate energy consumption data to  office workstations as well as automated mechanisms  to optimize energy consumption, enabling up to a 50  percent reduction in energy usage while increasing  performance and computer lifespan. Reflective of the innovation we continually pursue,  some of these tools have more advanced methodologies  than Microsoft currently uses for its corporate  carbon disclosure. We have found new opportunities to use Microsoft  solutions to more sustainably manage operations. We started with our own operations and are expanding  their use beyond our direct business activities. Microsoft is accelerating sustainability through Smart  Places, with IoT and AI to optimize the way buildings,  campuses, and cities consume and deliver resources  and create efficiencies. Based on Azure IoT, Smart Places  include data-driven technologies for monitoring and  managing carbon, water, and waste in buildings to turn  inefficiencies into opportunities to reduce environmental  impact. Organizations can optimize energy management  and reduce carbon emissions by using predictive  monitoring to help manage equipment performance  and energy consumption and to explore grid-interactive  efficient buildings and infrastructure. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights breaks  down data silos by connecting and taking inputs from  enterprise resource planning and supply chain systems  across an organization. Using industry data models and  AI-powered weather and environmental risk signals from  Bing and third-party sources, operations can get a better  view of climate-related risk to build a more resilient  supply chain. For more than two years, we have  pioneered tools and features to  provide a close to real-time view  of our products’ footprint, and  we continue to deliver more  transparency to customers. Customers and partners  Matching the supply and demand of carbon  sequestration with AI and machine learning  
Project Acorn, developed by Rabobank, is a global,  transparent, and technology-enabled marketplace and  ecosystem for carbon sequestration. The proposition  facilitates agroforestry projects among smallholder  farmers in developing countries that sequester carbon  in biomass through tree growth; the carbon removal  units that result from this represent actual sequestration. To make small-size projects on an individual farmer level  economically viable, Project Acorn uses remote sensing  technologies, including the analysis of satellite imagery  by specialized partners. The architectural design was  built on a Dynamics 365 platform and uses customized  Azure functionality. Algo Engines and Microsoft helped Ørsted, the  world leader in offshore wind energy, to optimize the  performance of more than 1,300 turbines on its wind  farms, enabling it to fully phase out coal by 2023 and  increase offshore wind capacity to 15 GW (enough for  30 million people) by 2025. Ørsted uses Microsoft Azure  AI to determine where new turbines should be deployed. Previously, the computations for the foundations alone  took weeks. With the cloud, that time is reduced to four  to eight hours. The company also uses drones to inspect  equipment and predictive maintenance to ensure all  equipment is running at peak performance. 8  
Microsoft helped  Ørsted optimize the  performance of more  than 1,300 turbines,  enabling it to fully  phase out coal by 2023  and increase offshore  wind capacity to 15 GW  by 2025. Vasakronan, Sweden’s largest real estate company,  manages a real estate portfolio worth SEK170 billion  (USD19.6 billion). To reduce operating costs for its  commercial properties, the company has adopted  ProptechOS, an Azure IoT-based solution that unlocks  the potential of connected, intelligent properties. By adding Azure Digital Twins to this solution, in 2021  the company has saved upwards of 6 million krona  (USD700,000) in energy consumption cost alone. By focusing on sustainability improvements, equally  important to tenants, the company has experienced  higher incomes through increased occupancy while  simultaneously driving higher asset values. 8  
Mercedes-Benz USA chose Microsoft Dynamics 365  Remote Assist and HoloLens 2 technologies to improve  service technician efficiency, reduce time to diagnose,  and lower the cost and environmental impact of service- related travel. With Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and  HoloLens 2, problems are typically resolved remotely  without having to wait for a Field Service Engineer to  visit the dealer. Travel has been cut by up to 40 percent,  significantly lowering their carbon footprint. 8  
Nomad Go used the Co-Innovation Labs, recently  launched by Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation  and Microsoft, to build a version of its building  decarbonization solution using Azure Cognitive Services  for computer vision with Sony’s IMX500 intelligent vision  sensor. Nomad Go’s platform anonymously counts the  number of people within a space (such as conference  rooms or open areas), and then uses the real-time  data to precisely heat, cool, and ventilate rooms only  when occupied. This replaces set schedules, standard in  most commercial buildings, which condition rooms for  12 hours or more a day, even when no one is in the space. The Nomad Go solution significantly reduces energy  usage and greenhouse emissions by up to 38 percent. 8 We know that our action alone will  not address the climate crisis. We are  focused on new ways to harness the  power of technology, partnerships,  investments, and policy to drive impact  at scale and pace to help the world get  to carbon zero. At Microsoft we know that our action alone will not  address the climate crisis, so we must help develop  the markets for carbon abatement approaches. This is  a partnership between our operational sustainability  program, Climate Innovation Fund, and Microsoft  Research to ensure that we are not only procuring  and funding the technologies we need to meet our  commitments, but also investing in the companies  that provide them—and supporting research and  development for pre-commercial solutions. Researchers at Microsoft tackle critical challenges that  will shape the future of the world and the company. Given the significance of sustainability challenges for  our global future, research teams around the world are  developing new technologies and approaches to reduce  carbon, use compute resources more efficiently, and  bring AI to bear on problems from carbon emissions  modeling to improvements in renewable energy. Afforestation (growth of net new trees) pulls carbon  from the atmosphere. Trees on farms can also improve  agricultural productivity and provide additional income  to farmers through the sale of carbon credits. Buyers of  such credits, however, want to ensure that the farmer is  properly incentivized to safeguard tree growth over time. Using the lens of contract theory, Microsoft research  shows how to calculate the optimal stream of payments  over time to ensure incentive alignment. This research  can be applied to enlarge the supply of carbon reduction  credits, especially outside the developed world. Trees on farms can provide additional  income to farmers through the sale of  carbon credits. Using contract theory,  Microsoft research shows how to  calculate the optimal stream of  payments to ensure farmers are  properly incentivized to safeguard  tree growth over time. Many AI tasks, like predicting the next word a person  will type, rely on machine learning with neural networks,  also known as deep learning. These neural networks  can unlock new sustainability solutions, but also  can consume a lot of energy. In a new effort, we are  building tools for AI developers to predict the energy  consumption of a neural network before deployment,  so that more compute- and energy-efficient networks  can be designed upfront. We have progressed on other  techniques enabling more efficient networks, including  factorizable neural operators (FNO), a compression  technique that affords reductions in compute and  memory requirements. Applied to large-scale language  models such as BERT, FNO reduced memory usage  by 80 percent and prediction time by 50 percent,  with less than a 5 percent reduction in accuracy. Further improvements may be achieved by combining  FNO with other model compression methods, such  as distillation and quantization. Collaborating with  researchers at NVIDIA, we’ve developed a new method  to find neural networks that satisfy hardware constraints,  such as low power consumption for mobile devices. This highly efficient method can find high-performing  architectures in minutes, enabling carbon savings  compared to previous methods. We also advanced AI  systems research to explicitly optimize for server power  reduction, in addition to capacity efficiency; this work  has resulted in a multi-GWh/year reduction of power  consumption for Azure and Microsoft 365. By using deep learning methods, we have predicted  carbon reduction and other climate-related outcomes  with much faster turnaround times, and similar or better  predictive accuracy, than using traditional physical  simulation models. For example, with the University of  Tokyo, we developed a neural network-based model  that can simulate physical and chemical processes critical  to carbon storage, such as the formation of hydrates  that can fill cracks between sand and rocks under the  ocean floor, thus playing a critical role in ensuring safer  thousand-year storage of carbon. With this model, we  were able to accurately predict hydrate formation 1,000  times faster than with numerical models. With Tsinghua  University, we developed a neural network-based  atmosphere simulator that estimates carbon and other  pollutant emissions with better accuracy than widely  used numerical atmosphere models, while using only  1 percent of the computational cost. For simulations  of the behavior of fluids in the atmosphere to better  understand the diffusion of pollutants and the global  warming effect, we invented a neural network-based  model to solve the necessary partial differential  equations, delivering accuracy on par with traditional  numerical solvers while delivering results 50 to 100  times faster. 8  
Satisfying the growing global demand for renewable  energy requires reducing costs and better integrating  renewables into electricity and transportation grids. In collaboration with one of India’s largest solar panel  manufacturers, Microsoft researchers developed a  machine learning-based computer vision system that  can accurately detect and classify defects in solar panels  as they are being manufactured. By fixing defects in real  time, solar panel manufacturers can achieve higher yield  and lower production costs, and solar energy operators  can produce more energy per panel. Carbon Insights is a visualization and analysis platform  that provides carbon neutralization roadmaps for  researchers, policy audiences, and other sustainability  decision-makers. Dashboards and maps combine local  detail with global consistency to show daily carbon  emission sources, sinks, and flux with near-global  coverage. The tool is based on data aggregated from  Tsinghua University research and public datasets. It provides strategic insights for challenges such as  prioritizing local emissions reductions or estimating  impacts on economic growth. We developed a  neural network- based atmosphere  simulator that estimates  carbon and other  pollutant emissions  with better accuracy  than widely used  numerical atmosphere  models, while using  only 1 percent of the  computational cost. To achieve net zero emissions globally, we must  reduce carbon emissions across every sector and  scale carbon markets as much as possible, as soon  as possible. From the outset, the Climate Innovation  Fund (CIF) has identified and prioritized investment  in sectors that have the largest carbon reduction and  removal potential globally and where Microsoft’s  carbon footprint is greatest. We also make strategic  philanthropic investments, like our $100 million donation  to Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst initiative, to help  accelerate and scale new carbon solutions. Our initial CIF investments included innovations in  market-enabling technologies such as climate impact  certification, forest carbon analytics, and carbon  transformation, plus industry-specific carbon reduction  via sustainable fuels, distributed energy integration, and  supply chain optimization technologies. Additionally, we  have made investment commitments in carbon reduction  solutions for global communities in emerging economies,  including India and Africa, as well as clean energy access  solutions for communities in the United States. SustainCERT is a software-enabled carbon emissions  accounting and verification platform reimagining a  future where issuance of high-quality carbon credits  and other impact claims becomes scalable with integrity.

Energy Impact Partners (EIP) Fund II participated  in SmartRent’s $60 million Series C funding round. SmartRent is a smart home automation platform  which provides property managers with visibility  and control over assets and delivers a smart home  experience to residents in the United States and  Canada. Environmental savings from the deployment  of smart thermostats across its portfolio in 2020 were  estimated to be 55,000 MWh of energy, 5.5 million  gallons of gasoline equivalent, and carbon savings  of 68,000 mtCO2. 8  
In September 2021, The Proceedings of the National  Academy of Sciences published a study that found that  Hispanic and Black people in the San Francisco Bay Area  experienced up to 30 percent higher air pollution than  average. Drawing from Aclima’s mobile measurements,  the authors including UT Austin, UC Berkeley, and  Aclima scientists found that substantial disparities  arise from regional and local differences in pollution. These findings show that combining hyperlocal air  pollution data with demographic data is an important  way to identify disproportionate impacts that go unseen  using traditional methods and can help decision-makers  target emission reduction and mitigation efforts where  they are needed most. 8 Through our AI for Earth program, we are supporting  startups and nonprofits capitalizing on the cloud, data,  and AI to accelerate the pace of innovation in carbon. The University of Maryland is applying machine learning  algorithms on airborne lidar data, collected over the  entire state of Maryland, to identify individual trees  to measure forest carbon storage, thereby reducing  uncertainties in current carbon monitoring prototypes  used for measurement, reporting, and verification  purposes in forest management and climate initiatives. Jejak.in is applying AI to automatically classify and label  photos captured by drone cameras and satellites in the  Citarum Watershed area in West Java, Indonesia, for  a more effective and efficient method to identify trees  and vegetation, as well as calculate carbon stocks in  the area. This will be used to help monitor the success  of conservation programs and make better decisions  about future programs. The University of California San Diego is using  remote sensing technology and machine learning to  better characterize mangroves, guide management  of the habitat, and curb mangrove deforestation  by increasing the availability of reliable data on  mangrove coverage and extent. The Aburto Lab  and Engineers for Exploration are developing  a methodology that uses machine learning to  automatically distinguish and quantify Mexico’s  mangroves from drone and satellite imagery,  resulting in an improved understanding of how  mangrove distribution changes through time, as  well as the ability to estimate mangrove biomass  and calculate the carbon storage. Getting to net zero is going to take more than  investments, technology, and commitments. We’ll  need to use all those together in sectoral and multi- stakeholder organizations that drive full ecosystem  change. Microsoft participates in many of these  efforts and spearheads work across several, including  the following. Transform to Net Zero (TONZ) is a cross-sector initiative  to accelerate the transition to a net zero global economy. The group’s 2025 goal is for all Fortune Global 1000  companies to have targets backed up by transformation  plans to achieve net zero no later than 2050. TONZ’s  strategy is to achieve this through enabling business  transformation, taking collective action, and driving  systemic change. This includes a focus on demonstrating  the transformation of members’ own businesses  and inspiring transformation in other companies. Since its initial launch in late 2020, TONZ has released  a position paper and action plan to define the group’s  position on net zero goals and their implementation,  formed decarbonization approaches across key supply  chain areas, and published two research reports  on the building blocks of net zero and key sectoral  challenges. In Q3 2021, TONZ published the first of a  set of transformation guides to share lessons learned  from TONZ companies on net zero implementation  across procurement, net zero goalsetting, and  policy engagement. Launched in 2021, BASCS aims to bridge the gap in  climate finance by providing a central platform for  businesses and experts to meet, learn, discuss, and  act together. As a founding member of the alliance,  Microsoft is sharing our resources and experiences  as an early adopter of climate solutions, as well as an  investor providing catalytic capital for nascent and  first-of-a-kind climate solutions. Microsoft co-founded the Carbon Removal Climate  Action Group of the World Economic Forum (WEF)  CEO Climate Leaders Alliance to help raise corporate  awareness about the importance of carbon removal. The alliance will also create a due diligence platform and  a joint purchasing strategy for carbon removal. In April 2021, Microsoft was announced as one of  the founding members of SABA. Led by RMI and the  Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), SABA will work  to accelerate the path to net zero aviation by driving  investment in SAF, catalyzing SAF production and  technological innovation, and supporting member  engagement in policy-making efforts. Our gaming business has partnered with the United  Nations Environment Programme on the Playing for the  Planet initiative. Its goals are to reduce the impact of the  gaming ecosystem on the environment through better  carbon accounting and educating gamers everywhere  on sustainable causes. For example, the Minecraft Build  a Better World Initiative delivers in-game content about  the need to protect and conserve, and matching funds to  charitable organizations focused on conservation. TONZ’s 2025 goal is  for all Fortune Global  1000 companies to have  targets backed up by  transformation plans to  achieve net zero no later  than 2050. Mojang have already established themselves in the  gaming community as world leaders in social outreach  and education. Minecraft: Education Edition has reached  millions of students with build challenges to create  sustainable cities of the future, and with curriculum  aligned lesson plans on climate and environmental  themes. Mojang is committed to continued innovation  in sustainability with new projects including the  UNESCO Global Build Challenge, Climate Futures in  partnership with Met Office, and the Sustainable City  Map. By integrating green activations in games and  supporting the global environmental agenda through  initiatives ranging from planting millions of trees to  reducing plastic in their products, we believe Xbox can  have significant impact in improving the world. Microsoft launched the Green Software Foundation  in May 2021 alongside Accenture, ThoughtWorks, and  GitHub to create green software industry standards, drive  awareness, grow advocacy, and accelerate innovation  to enable developers to reduce the carbon emissions of  the software platforms that they build. The foundation  has grown to 20 members and over 350 individual  contributors collaborating on standards, innovation,  and education. The first version of the Software Carbon  Intensity (SCI) standard, a methodology for scoring  software applications, was released in December 2021. Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the  upscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multi- level, and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by  both incremental and transformational adaptation. Those efforts must be guided by policy that accelerates  carbon reduction and removal opportunities. Over the  past year Microsoft deepened its policy advocacy on  carbon and sharpened its focus on net zero goals,  energy grid decarbonization, measurement, and markets  in the United States and European Union through  direct lobbying, engagement, and groups such as the  Climate Leadership Council, CERES BICEP Network,  Advanced Energy Economy, Climate and Clean Energy  Solutions, and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance. Microsoft initiatives include the following. Microsoft is encouraging countries to make net zero  carbon-aligned national commitments and develop  effective implementation plans. Microsoft advocated for  the United States’ reentry to the Paris Climate Agreement  which occurred in January 2021 and for a national US  climate target to cut emissions by 50 percent by 2030. We also voiced Microsoft support of the European  Commission’s ”Fit for 55” package, a set of legislative  initiatives that will set the framework for the whole EU  to achieve the binding target of reducing GHG emissions  by at least 55 percent by 2030 (based on 1990 levels). Microsoft advocated for strong climate and clean  energy provisions in the 2021 US budget reconciliation  and infrastructure bills including new siting authority  for transmission lines, support for innovative  technologies and projects that remove carbon dioxide,  modernizing the grid, accelerating clean energy, and  strengthening resilience to the impacts of a changing  
climate. Microsoft actively engages in decarbonization  and grid modernization policy efforts in Arizona,  Texas, Illinois, and Virginia, and encouraged FERC to  issue policy guidance on how to incorporate state- determined carbon prices in wholesale electricity  markets. In Europe, Microsoft engages actively with  the European institutions advocating for robust clean  energy rules and sustainability metrics for datacenters  and submitted comments in February to the European  Commission Public Consultations on the revisions of  the Renewable Energy Directive and Energy Efficiency  Directive. Microsoft engaged with the UK government  and energy regulator to inform the “Digitalising the UK  energy system for net zero” strategy published in July  and its implementation. Microsoft is advocating for common accounting  and public disclosure of carbon and climate-related  information. In June, Microsoft submitted comments  to the US Securities Exchange Commission in support  of the development and adoption of disclosure rules  that will provide material, decision-useful information  for investors. In September, Microsoft filed an aligned  response to the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s  consultation on Carbon Measurement and provided  information to the US Department of Defense on  climate change disclosure practices to support  implementation of the Executive Order on Climate  Related Financial Disclosure. In March, Microsoft joined  the European Green Digital Coalition, supported by the  European Commission, with the goals of developing  standardized, credible, and comparable methodologies  for calculating the net impact of green digital solutions  in different sectors, and accelerating the contribution  of digital technology to our collective 2030 goals. Microsoft supported a new academic report by  Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL),  exploring how trade and trade-related policies could  
be used to support decarbonization, focused on the  EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM),  as part of advancing the conversation around common  standards for carbon measurement and accounting. Microsoft is advocating a range of policies to help  carbon-related markets mature, including carbon  pricing and research and development (R&D). Microsoft supported the Washington State Climate  Commitment Act, approved in May, which sets a cap on  emissions and establishes a robust carbon pricing  
and investment program. Microsoft advocated for  increased US R&D in key technologies such as energy  storage and direct air capture, which was included in  the 2020 Energy Act and the bipartisan infrastructure  package. Microsoft is advancing the development of  carbon removal markets and consistent, high-quality  carbon removal standards through comments to the  US Department of Agriculture and by joining the Carbon  Capture Coalition. In August, Microsoft submitted a  response to the European Commission Carbon Removal  Certification Mechanism survey to advocate for common  standards for carbon removal quality and to provide  input into the design of a future legislative framework. Carbon removal is a seller’s market. The pipeline  is short for surging demand, and corporate  buyers need more project development. Climate change is further complicating this, as  wildfires erode the forest carbon purchases we’ve  made and we, as well as other purchasers, need  expanded credit buffers to ensure credits we pay  for are removing carbon from the atmosphere. As Microsoft and the world mature in carbon  accounting, we will continue to get better  at understanding how our decisions reduce,  or sometimes increase, carbon emissions. For example, some of the data used to estimate  hardware emissions within certain categories  of Scope 3 is drawn from industry-average  “secondary” data rather than directly from  suppliers. This data may not be reflective  of recent supplier activity, which may cause  fluctuations in emissions as primary data from  suppliers is introduced. Projects don’t consistently account for durability,  additionality, and leakage. To scale the market  in the long term, we need the enabling  infrastructure to measure, monitor, and verify  carbon removal quality now, and we need clear  guidelines under the Paris Agreement about how  to reconcile corporate and country-level actions. See Microsoft Carbon Removal - Lessons From an  Early Corporate Purchase to learn more. Displacing incumbent technologies and  spurring innovation needs to be supported  in all geographies to address the uneven  distribution of those impacts—both positive  and negative—around the world. For example, diesel fuel accounts for less than  1 percent of Microsoft’s overall emissions. But finding solutions to reduce reliance on  traditional diesel fuels, which power the backup  infrastructure that supports our datacenters, will  require significant innovation and investment  by those with a much greater stake and reward  than Microsoft alone. This same scenario plays  out for electrifying our fleet and transitioning to  induction cooktops. Longer-term purchasing contracts send a  firm demand signal for developers, creating  a business case for them to help build plants. Microsoft is dedicated to continuing being a  pioneer in addressing the climate crisis head  on. We will continue to help ensure project  quality in the market and drive for more  accurate carbon accounting. We expect to focus on further innovations  in renewable energy, carbon reduction, and  carbon-free materials. For example, by using  machine learning to forecast electricity load,  we can enable grid-interactive datacenter  components, such as batteries for backup power,  to participate in ancillary energy markets and  stabilize an electric grid with a higher penetration  of renewable energy sources. We’ll conduct new  research to inform the technical and business  possibilities of co-locating datacenters with  offshore wind farms and investigating the  feasibility of using supercritical carbon dioxide  (sCO2) as a coolant for immersion of servers  within the datacenter. We are innovating and piloting other backup  power sources in our datacenter regions, which  could in the future provide viable replacements  for generators. Batteries already supply short- term backup power needs, filling the roughly  30-second gap between a potential outage on  the grid and the time it takes to power up the  diesel generators. In the future, batteries with  a longer duration could replace the role diesel  generators play today. We are continually evaluating design changes  and developing new specifications to facilitate  deep embodied carbon reductions in our campus  and datacenter designs. We are analyzing both  the optimal use of conventional materials, such as  concrete and steel, and pursuing more ambitious  opportunities with emerging alternative  materials that carry significantly less embodied  carbon. We are also developing solutions to help  organizations reduce and manage emissions and  energy consumption, such as through Azure IoT  solutions for energy and sustainability. We continue to pursue new opportunities to  fund high integrity, engineered carbon removal  projects. We are also investing in digital tools to  scale nature-based carbon removal solutions,  such as soil carbon sequestration technologies. We will continue refining emission reduction  plans with suppliers and ensuring that they  have the resources they need to make these  reductions with a goal of having the aggregate  reductions meet Microsoft’s Scope 3 commitment. We will continue to embed sustainability  into procurement processes and reset goals,  metrics, and incentives to support carbon  reduction targets. In Microsoft’s commentary to the Securities  Exchange Commission climate disclosure, we  predicted, “Individual consumers will have the  ability to choose among competing products  based on relative carbon emissions, as they do  today when it comes to the nutritional content  of food products.” While many companies report  their products’ carbon footprints using well- established methodologies, these footprints  are not currently comparable due to divergent,  non-standard, and proprietary data and  assumptions. Microsoft is exploring how to  enable new methodologies and standards  for comparable product labels that could be  used across industries and administered by  independent certification or regulatory bodies. Developed in partnership with ENGIE Impact, WSP,  and CDP to help companies, and our suppliers, report  their GHG emissions, develop clean energy strategies,  and reduce their energy-related emissions.

A Microsoft-funded independent analysis of the  soil projects on the voluntary carbon market and  assessment based on four key criteria. A white paper with an inside look into how Microsoft  is reducing emissions during the construction of new  buildings and datacenters. We are committed to becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 and helping others on their journeys. “Getting ahead of the world’s  water crisis will require a  reduction in the amount  of water used to operate  economies and societies,  as well as a transformation  in the way we manage our  water systems.” The scientific consensus is clear: water security and  our capacity to safeguard sustainable access to quality  freshwater resources is increasingly at risk. There is a  global increase in water demand that follows population  growth, economic development, and changing  consumption patterns. Research by WRI projects that by  2030, there will be a 56 percent deficit in water supply  relative to demand if no actions are taken to alleviate this. At present, about 25 percent of the global population  lives in countries that suffer from water stress, and one in  ten people lack access to safe drinking water. We are committed to becoming a water positive  company by 2030. We will do this by continuing our  water stewardship work across our operations, building  on the steps taken to reduce the water consumption in  our datacenters and campuses over the past decade. In addition to reductions, we aim to become water  positive through expanding access to clean water and  replenishment projects. We will reduce the water intensity of our direct  operations and replenish in water-stressed regions  where we work. We will provide more than 1.5 million people with  access to clean water and sanitation services by 2030. We will use our technology to generate actionable  insights, increase awareness of water issues, and  optimize water replenishment. We will work with companies around the world to drive  innovation and adoption of water technologies. We will use our voice at the local, national, and global  levels to increase water access and availability, improve  quality, and ensure the integration of water into  climate strategies. We will partner with others to drive collective action  to increase access and reduce water stress. In FY21, Microsoft invested in replenishment  projects that are expected to generate over  1.3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits,  bringing us to 21 replenishment projects to date  in nine water basins across the globe. Our programs with Water.org account for over  670 million liters 9 of water benefit per year in  areas facing water scarcity and climate challenges  that overlap with our business operations in  strategic locations. Through our partnership with Water.org,  we provided more than 95,000 10 people  with access to safe water or sanitation. Through AI for Earth, Microsoft has supported  116 projects that create data-driven solutions  supporting water resources monitoring, modeling,  and management centered around water. In 2021, Microsoft was awarded the  U.S. Water Prize for Outstanding Private Sector  Organization for adopting our water positive  program and committing to being water  positive by 2030. Microsoft, in collaboration with BlackRock and WRI  India, supported the Wave2Web Hackathon to help  develop new datasets on water stress in emerging  markets and improve predictive modeling for better  planning of water resources and risk preparedness  in cities. Water Table 1  Replenishing more water than we use on our journey to become water positive by 2030  
In FY21, our contracted water replenishment amounted to 45 percent of our global water consumption  across our operations. a. Reported water replenishment volumes represent total contracted water replenishment projects for each fiscal year. Reported water replenishment volumes may be adjusted once individual projects are completed and volumes verified. Water Table 2  Delivering on our commitment to enable the provision of water and sanitation services to  1.5 million people in seven water-stressed countries by 2030  
In FY21, we provided 95,130 people with water access across India and Indonesia. From the program’s inception  through calendar year 2021, we have provided 242,988 people with water access in Mexico, India, and Indonesia. To meet our commitment to being  water positive by 2030, we will reduce  our water footprint across our direct  operations, while replenishing and  increasing water access in water- stressed regions where we work. We are taking new approaches to water collection,  treatment, reuse, and reduction at our campuses and  datacenters across the globe. This includes efficiency  measures as well as fit-for-purpose water usage  design—we are focused on using the right type of  water in the right context from campus to datacenters to  device manufacturing. Key efforts include the following. Microsoft is using the Smart Water Navigator, which  we developed with Ecolab, in our datacenters to  prioritize and manage incoming water quality sources  like recycled water. In San Antonio, Texas, we have  significantly reduced the datacenter’s potable water  usage, which will now be used to supply water to homes,  providing economic as well as environmental benefits. We deployed sensors in our Quincy, Washington  datacenter location, where we’re using the data on  real-time water quality to drive operational insights  and adjustments to maintenance and water chemistry. Across our operations, we’re testing new techniques, like  raising supply air temperatures and harvesting water  from our rooftops, to further reduce water consumption. Across our global datacenter fleet, outside air is our  primary method of cooling for an average of nine  months of the year. External temperatures and humidity  play a key role in determining when additional cooling  is required—and when required, we utilize an adiabatic  cooling system to reduce air temperature by evaporating  water in its presence. Adiabatic cooling, along with  higher temperature operations, significantly reduces  power and water usage when comparing to mechanical  water-based cooling systems. At our new datacenter  region in Arizona, which opened in June 2020, we use  zero water for cooling for more than half the year, taking  advantage of adiabatic cooling. We are also partnering  with First Solar to provide solar energy rather than  traditional electricity generation, which will reduce power  plant cooling water. At our new datacenter  region in Arizona,  we use zero water  for cooling for more  than half the year,  taking advantage of  adiabatic cooling. In 2021, Microsoft was the first cloud provider to run  two-phased liquid immersion cooling in a production  environment, demonstrating viability for broader use  in our datacenters. We are using liquid immersion in a  production environment, which involves placing servers  in a tub of inert fluid that boils at 50°C, which removes  the heat generated by the chips, servers, and power  supplies, and condenses the fluid in coils at the top of  the rack. This “rains” back in the tank. Because of the  elevated operating temperature, this type of cooling  does not require use of evaporated water. Our latest  testing addresses the concept of overclocking, which  is to operate chip components beyond their  pre-defined voltage, thermal, and power design limits  to further improve performance. Our tests found  that some chipsets show an increased performance  by 20 percent with liquid cooling. This may also have  benefits beyond reduction of water use, as this approach  can allow for datacenter rack designs that create  increased capacity per square foot in a datacenter. We’re investigating and piloting turning up the heat in  our datacenters. The higher server inlet temperatures  will reduce cooling hours and water use. If the pilot is  successful, we expect to be fully implemented by 2025,  which has the potential to eliminate water use for cooling  in regions like Amsterdam and Dublin, while reducing  water use in dry regions like Arizona and Wyoming. In 2021, our new Silicon Valley campus officially opened. It is now operating as the first technology campus with  a net zero water certification as not a drop of water  for more than 2,000 employees, 15 acres of landscape,  and 643,000 square feet of built space will come from  municipal sources, beyond drinking fountains and sinks. Our Herzliya, Israel site’s landscaping also uses 100 percent  of the air conditioning condensate water for its irrigation  and cooling towers, resulting in an estimated savings of  over 3 million liters annually. Our LinkedIn headquarters  in California is planning to utilize municipal recycled  water for landscaping and internal plumbing, thus saving  30 million liters of potable water each year. Our Herzliya, Israel site utilizes Watergen’s technology to  produce fresh drinking water from the humidity in the air,  producing an estimated 237,000 liters annually, based on  company calculations. In Hyderabad, India, we’re piloting  air-to-water generators that will capture the moisture  in humid air, purify it, and produce safe drinking water. These generator plants will help offset 4 million liters of  ground water extraction per year, based on company  calculations, in this water-stressed region, where water  scarcity is an ongoing crisis that is expected to worsen. Microsoft uses textiles in our computer palm rests and  type covers, and the textile industry is one of the biggest  consumers of water. Each of the various manufacturing  phases, including yarn processing, greige production,  and the dyeing finish process requires a significant  amount of water. To reduce water, we removed the  dyeing process on our CLARINO fabric by switching  to a solution dye technique which reduces water  consumption by 20 percent. This is a completely solvent- free, environmentally friendly manufacturing choice that  is used in three of our products currently in production  across the HoloLens and Surface type cover lines. As part of our commitment to be water positive by 2030,  we will replenish more water than we consume, focusing  on high water-stressed regions. We will achieve this goal  by investing in water projects that protect watersheds,  restore wetlands, and improve infrastructure. In addition  to generating volumetric water benefits, many projects  offer a wide range of additional co-benefits. When sourcing water replenishment projects, we  consider contextual conditions of the watershed and  aim to invest in projects that align with site-specific  water assessments and have local stakeholder support. We have invested in 21 projects to date in nine water  basins across the globe. In FY21, Microsoft invested in  projects that are expected to generate over 1.3 million  cubic meters of volumetric benefits. Progress towards  our commitment is made possible due to several  strategic partnerships with non-governmental  organizations, such as Bonneville Environmental  Foundation (BEF), the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC),  the Nature Conservancy, and implementation partners,  including Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, National  Audubon Society, and WaterAid. We also participate  in the California Water Action Collaborative, a network  of over 25 organizations learning together, collectively  developing projects, and advancing innovative solutions  to improve water security and resilience across California. Reversing environmental degradation in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. Reversing environmental degradation in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. In FY21, Microsoft  invested in  replenishment projects  that are expected to  generate over 1.3 million  cubic meters of  volumetric benefits. Given the nascent water replenishment project market,  we make investments at least a fiscal year before a  project delivers volumetric benefits. We are still able to  make estimates on volumetric benefits, just as we do with  renewable energy projects upon signing even though  the project has yet to be built. We are taking new steps  to validate these estimates. In FY21, 10 of Microsoft’s  replenishment project investments underwent a third- party quantification to verify and update the initial  volumetric benefit estimates using the Volumetric Water  Benefit Accounting (VWBA) guidance. We will continue  to use the VWBA guidance to quantify volumetric water  benefits when contracting with a replenishment partner. Microsoft has invested in a project to restore the  East Creek meadow and reverse environmental  degradation caused by disconnection of the channels  in California’s Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade  Mountain ranges from the meadows and floodplains  below. September 2021 groundwater levels indicate  that the meadow is beginning to retain groundwater  during the dry season, even with reduced precipitation  and late-season contributions from snowpack runoff. The restoration has also contributed to fire resiliency  —within two months of the Dixie fire, native species  were re-sprouting in the burned areas due to residual  soil moisture. Microsoft and Gila River Water Storage are recharging  and replenishing groundwater levels in the cities  of Goodyear and El Mirage, Arizona, to balance a  portion of Microsoft’s future water use, contributing  an estimated additional 610,000 cubic meters. Microsoft is also collaborating with The Nature  Conservancy to support water conservation in the  Verde River Basin in Arizona through projects such as  piping irrigation ditches to efficiently water farmland  and leave more water in the Verde River. Microsoft supported three water restoration projects  in the Columbia River Basin near Quincy, Washington. One of the projects benefits the Roaring Creek by  improving habitat for fish listed under the Endangered  Species Act, including Upper Columbia Steelhead,  spring Chinook, bull trout, lamprey, and cutthroat trout. The second project is focused on relocation of beavers  to watersheds where natural beaver dam building  helps to promote fish passage, improves water quality,  increases groundwater storage, and mitigates flooding. The third project improves water use efficiency on  farm and irrigation delivery infrastructure to help local  agricultural producers adapt to changing growing  conditions while also supporting rivers and local fish. Under the Drought Contingency Plan, Arizona is seeking  to help stabilize water levels in Lake Mead and reduce  the impact and severity of shortage declarations in  Nevada, Arizona, and Southern California by financially  compensating the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT)  
for water saved. Microsoft has contributed funds to  compensate the CRIT for their water rights to the  Colorado River through a lease for system conservation  and water supply benefits. In exchange for monetary  compensation, the CRIT have pledged to forgo irrigation  water deliveries and fallow approximately 10,000 acres  of farmland, leaving significant volumes in Lake Mead  over the next few years. We will replenish more water than  we consume, focusing on high  water-stressed regions and investing  in water projects that protect  watersheds, restore wetlands,  and improve infrastructure. With 1.1 billion people in the world without access  to clean water, it’s not enough to simply reduce and  replenish—we need to improve people’s access to safe,  clean water. Our goal is to provide access to safe drinking  water and improved sanitation solutions for 1.5 million  people while accounting for 25 billion liters of net  positive water impact in high-stress watersheds where  we also operate, namely India, Indonesia, and Mexico,  by 2030. In 2020, we began our work with Water.org to help  people living in underserved communities gain lasting  and reliable access to safe drinking water and improved  sanitation solutions. This includes household taps  and toilets, piped connections, rainwater harvesting,  water storage, purification, and community filtration. In FY21, we helped more than 95,000 people in India  and Indonesia 10 and expect to reach at least 840,000  people by September 2023. Nearly all the beneficiaries  are women and live below the poverty line. These  programs account for over 670 million liters of water  benefit per year in areas facing water scarcity and climate  challenges that overlap with our business operations in  strategic locations. 9  
Through our  partnership with  Water.org, we provided  more than 95,000 people  with access to safe  water or sanitation. 670M  
In Rasulpur Aul Kendrapara, houses are made of thatch, mud,  and concrete, and rarely have water or sanitation connections. Rehana and her daughter used to walk up to six hours a day to get  water for cooking, laundry, and baths from an unreliable hand-pump  managed by the government. On days it was unavailable,  
they collected water from the river or purchased it from a vendor,  paying high prices for water in time and money. Families like  Rehana’s find the small water and sanitation loans offered by  Water.org’s partners in India to be affordable, practical solutions to  their family’s water and sanitation needs. Rehana learned that she  could make affordable payments to establish a water connection  and was approved for a loan to construct a piped water connection  from the municipal water line to her home. Now the family enjoys  access to safe water and improved sanitation at home. We believe that Microsoft’s most  important contribution to water  reduction will come not from our  own work alone, but by helping  our customers, partners, and suppliers  around the world reduce their water  footprints through our learnings  and with the power of data, AI,  and digital technology. We are not a particularly large consumer of water today,  but we are learning from our work in our own operations. We are taking these lessons learned, new approaches,  and innovative partnerships and bringing them to our  global customer base, where we believe we can have a  transformative impact. As it so often does, the pathway to progress begins with  data. Water data is often segmented and siloed, both  within an organization and across multiple organizations  operating in the same watershed, which makes managing  a shared resource particularly challenging. Water data  often lacks context, meaning it is provided without an  understanding of underlying conditions in the area. This makes it difficult for any single organization to assess  its impact on a water basin, which in turn complicates  or obscures the most impactful intervention to address  water issues in that area. In addition, water data often  suffers from discontinuities, where data collection is  interrupted due to equipment failure or lack of funding  for observational networks. The digitization of water data is about making water data  credible, transparent, useful, and actionable. It includes  the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud platforms, business  intelligence, and AI. We are bringing new solutions to  organizations to better manage water consumption  and risk. With this tool, available today, organizations can  remotely monitor and control water flow and valve  pressure, manage alerts, and set up device commands  to reduce water costs and waste. Organizations need to also understand the quality of  their water, a key stressor on water availability. With this  solution, organizations can monitor water quality to  improve health outcomes and environmental impact. Developed by Ecolab and running on Azure,  organizations can identify water risks, set meaningful  context-based water goals, and leverage response tools  to help companies implement sustainable water practices  with this free platform from Ecolab. Deltares, a world leader in water and subsurface with  expertise in flood risk forecasting and ecosystem  monitoring, used Azure and the Microsoft Planetary  Computer to generate two global multi-decade datasets:  a Global Flood Risk dataset to assess the risk of flooding,  in particular the impact in coastal areas subject to sea  level rise, and a Global Water Reservoirs dataset to  determine water availability for up to 3,000 reservoirs  around the world for both drinking water and hydro  power planning. Both datasets help organizations  to relate changing water conditions to humanity,  infrastructure, and environments. Enova, a joint venture between Majid Al Futtaim  and Veolia, is an integrated energy and facilities  management provider offering comprehensive services  and performance-based solutions to its clients to help  achieve their financial, operational, and environmental  targets. Powered by over 4,500 employees and a strong,  scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure on Azure, Enova  has achieved total savings of 320 million kWh of energy,  5 million cubic meters of water, and 210,000 tons of CO2  emissions. In 2021, Enova adopted a new business model  involving ICONICS and other tools supported by Azure  cloud services and over 320 customized fault and ECM  rules. Covering 28 medium to large sites, this resulted  in an additional 2 percent of energy savings and 17–25  percent improvement in staff efficiency. 8  
Microsoft is working with WRI to provide partners with  access to the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison  Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate projections, as  well as socioeconomic development projections based  on IPCC scenarios, on Microsoft Azure. Partners are now  able to model global water supply and demand with  CMIP6 data and scenarios for the first time. With WRI and BlackRock, Microsoft sponsored a global  hackathon challenge, Wave2Web. The organizations  worked together to develop new datasets on water  stress in emerging markets, inviting students and young  professionals to develop predictive modeling to forecast  water availability in reservoirs near Bengaluru, India. The Wave2Web hackathon included 2,130 participants  across 293 teams globally. Twenty-five shortlisted teams  received hands-on support to develop unique, forward- looking solutions. The three winners showcased their  prototypes in front of state and national stakeholders  at an online town hall conducted in October 2021. The Commissioner of the Karnataka State Natural  Disaster Management Center plans to continue  working with the winning teams to explore applications  of the prototypes as well as other opportunities for  collaboration to solve the growing water challenges  faced by Bengaluru. Anglian Water supplies more than 6 million customers  with water and water recycling services in the UK. It is  working to efficiently manage water supplies and raise  customer awareness of water conservation. A key part  of its strategy is smart metering, which it is rolling  
out across its entire region by 2030. Using Azure,  Anglian built a robust system for customer-side smart  metering, as well as monitoring and analysis of its  network. It also uses AI to understand the behavior of  reservoirs through each day, each season, and varying  meteorological conditions. Since the smart metering  program went live, customers have been able to find  and fix around 40,000 leaks in their homes, saving  almost 3 million liters of water every day. 8 We are focused on new ways to harness  the power of technology, partnerships,  investments, and policy to drive impact  at scale and pace to help the world  more effectively address water  availability and accessibility. To reach a water positive future, the world will need new  partnerships, solutions, and markets. That is why we go  beyond our operations and even our products to make  direct investments in the future of water, from R&D to  actual funding investments in promising technologies  that have the potential to scale rapidly and globally. Researchers at Microsoft tackle critical challenges that  will shape the future of the world and the company. Given the significance of sustainability challenges for  our global future, research teams around the world are  developing new technologies and approaches to ensure  water efficiency. Our research on Dependable IoT is enabling water  positivity for Microsoft and other companies by  developing the capability to ensure the accuracy of  sensors used to monitor water leaks, quality, and efficient  usage. With the incorporation of this capability into  Azure Verified Telemetry for IoT, we are partnering with  FluxGen, a sustainability startup in India that develops  AI and IoT-based water management solutions to make  industries water positive. The partnership is through the  Microsoft-Accenture Amplify program and Microsoft  Research India’s Center for Societal Impact through  Cloud and AI. The Climate Innovation Fund (CIF) invests in the  development and deployment of new technologies,  processes, and production changes that can improve  the condition and sustainability of our water resources. Our investment into Emerald Technology Ventures’  Global Water Impact Fund invested in Sofi Filtration is  currently serving early to expansion-stage companies  globally to drive critical innovation and its adoption in  the water space. Through our AI for Earth program, Microsoft is putting  AI tools into the hands of individuals and organizations  working on the frontlines of environmental challenges,  including water. To date, 116 AI for Earth grantees have  worked on water-related projects. Government agencies in Egypt face difficult decisions  when allocating water for agriculture and civilian use. To help agencies, the Egyptian government developed  a proof of concept solution that uses satellite image  analysis deep learning to determine crop type and land  area boundaries of smallholder farms. The intelligent  visualization using ArcGIS detects field boundaries,  identifies crops, and provides water demand forecast  estimates for decision makers that results in more  accurate allocations for sustainable agriculture and fair  water distribution for citizens. Microsoft supported a forest and water management  project by Conservation Science Partners by providing  resources around AI, machine learning, and cloud  computing on the Microsoft Azure platform. Using Azure,  Conservation Science Partners aggregates and analyzes  satellite imagery at high resolutions to better understand  how the forest cover across the western United States  changes from forest disturbance events and how this  influences water supply records. By linking the forest data to  water flow rate data records from before and after a forest  disturbance, an analysis can provide insights for conservation  planning and adapting forest and water management to  future climate change impacts. As a result, local communities,  regional organizations, and the federal government can  better manage and protect these vital resources. Recognizing that lower income and small communities  often face the largest barriers to safe and reliable  drinking water, Microsoft provided a grant to the  Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability  to support their work around secure water supplies. The Leadership Counsel will assimilate data from  disparate sources, using Azure resources to host  
and deploy machine learning models and create a   dashboard that people can interact with on a server. The dashboard will provide regulators, advocacy   groups, and the public with scientifically informed   estimates of the impact of extreme drought events on   drinking water availability. This contribution also allows   the Leadership Counsel to engage in wider community   outreach efforts, advocate for policy efforts that will   protect well water levels, and inform residents about the   potential impact of water conservation policy efforts. We partner with like-minded companies and leading  scientific organizations to develop and deliver research,  guidance, and implementation roadmaps that enable all  businesses to solve water challenges. Acknowledging the importance of collective action and  collaboration to solve shared water challenges, Microsoft  has endorsed the United Nations Global Compact CEO  Water Mandate, an initiative in co-Secretariat with the  Pacific Institute, since 2018. In 2020, Microsoft and six  other companies, together with the UN Global Compact  CEO Water Mandate, spearheaded the establishment of  the industry-driven Water Resilience Coalition (WRC). Microsoft serves as a Coalition leader and has pledged  its commitment to collective action, net positive water  impact, resilient value chain, and global leadership. We are committed to working with the Water Resilience  Coalition and its more than 30 members to make  progress against the WRC’s 2030 roadmap for collective  action. Microsoft is also advancing the development of  tools and resources to enable companies to step forward  by assessing and improving their water stewardship  actions in partnership with the CEO Water Mandate. Water Action Hub Platform 4.0 was first presented during  the 2021 World Water Week, was developed by the CEO  Water Mandate and made possible with support from  Microsoft. This latest version of the hub connects more  than 1,500 projects with over 1,000 partner organizations  worldwide. It also helps direct users to water tools by  Ecolab, WWF, WRI, and other leading organizations. Nature-Based Solutions Tool is a web-based  tool developed to serve as a key starting point for  organizations looking to invest in nature-based solutions  (NBS), and for those wishing to learn more about benefit  identification and accounting. The tool was developed  based on and in accordance with the published  Benefit Accounting of Nature-Based Solutions for  Watersheds Guide. Convened and facilitated by Ag Innovations, the  California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC) is a  network for diverse stakeholders to come together  and pursue collective action projects that will improve  California’s water resilience for people, business,  agriculture, and nature. Governments play a fundamental role in ensuring the  availability of safe and clean drinking water, maintaining  and expanding water infrastructure, protecting critical  water ecosystems, and responding to water crises. As a  leading company committed to using its voice for policy,  Microsoft has engaged in the following activities. Microsoft advocated for clean energy and environmental  provisions in the US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, which commits over $8 billion for western water  infrastructure and significant funding for water-related  and other resilience efforts. In 2020, Microsoft joined WaterEurope, the leading  association in Europe focused on technology and  innovation aspects of water, with a focus on digital  water. We have called for the inclusion of water-related  topics in EU polices, such as water infrastructure into  the COVID-19 recovery packages. The US Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs  Act commits over  $8 billion for western  water infrastructure and  significant funding for  water-related and other  resilience efforts. Companies will not be successful in managing  water stress in regions where we operate if we  try to tackle challenges independently. It will be  vital to partner with a wide range of stakeholders,  including NGOs, governments, customers, and  competitors—particularly in high-stress locations  with a limited supply of replenishment projects. Project oversight and monitoring of projects  with multi-year benefits, and check-ins with  implementation partners are all important. It’s  also necessary to validate the total volumetric  benefit, additional co-benefits, and project  duration through third-party quantification. Cultivating credible partners to identify the right  project type for each unique location is critical,  particularly for locations with limited supply of  shelf-ready projects. Utility bills only provide some of the information  companies need to truly understand and  manage their risk and reduce their water use  and the data typically does not arrive for months  after the water was used. By installing sensors  across our datacenters, we have been able to  track our water use in real time, allowing us  to more effectively monitor our reductions  and identify opportunities for increased water  efficiency. As we improve the quality of data  across our operations, we have learned that the  true cost of water is not aligned with its true  value. This misalignment makes it challenging  for companies to make the business case for  water-related investments. It is something we  are grappling with and will continue to explore  across our operations. We will continue to make progress against  our 2030 replenishment commitment. We have prioritized our investments in high- stress locations where we operate and work  with partners to identify the right type of  replenishment projects that align with the unique  challenges in each location. We will continue to  prioritize opportunities to partner with other  stakeholders, including companies  that operate in the same locations. We will continue to work with Water.org to make  progress against our accessibility commitment,  providing 1.5 million people with access to  clean water by 2030. Our support thus far has  focused on Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico,  and will expand to include China, Malaysia,  and South Africa. We will continue to explore  water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) solutions  that will provide people across the globe with  access to clean water and continue to identify  opportunities to implement them. We will continue to invest in new and existing  partnerships that will enable Microsoft to make  progress against our commitments and help  protect water resources for future generations. Given the collective approach required to solve  shared water challenges, we will continue to  build on partnerships like the Water Resilience  Coalition (WRC) that bring companies together  to pool funding and invest in solutions in  locations with extreme water stress. We will also  continue to support investments through our AI  for Earth fund that strengthen water data and  drive outcomes. To drive water use reductions in the short and  long term, increasing efficiency is critical and  it must be paired with innovation to ensure  businesses can continue to operate in an  unpredictable future with increasing water  challenges. As we identify innovative approaches  that work, we look forward to scaling these within  Microsoft and sharing them outside of our four  walls to further reduce pressure on the shared  water resources we depend on. We recognize that water is a challenge not  just across our operational footprint, but  also across our value chain. We will continue  to explore ways we can support suppliers in  understanding and managing their water risks. We also recognize that water and energy are  interlinked. Energy is required to pump and  transport water and similarly water is required  to produce electricity. We will continue to  strengthen our understanding of the ways  our energy procurement decisions can affect  water resources. We will use the investment from our Climate  Innovation Fund into Emerald Technology  Ventures to identify technology adoption  opportunities for emerging water technologies  that can help Microsoft achieve our water  positive commitment and support our customers. Identify organizations to partner with in specific  basins and use a wide range of tools and case studies. A new tool allows companies to evaluate their water  management maturity and compare progress  against peers. This guidance document provides corporate water  stewardship practitioners with a standardized approach  and set of indicators to quantify and communicate  the volumetric water benefits and complementary  indicators of water stewardship activities. Use this free tool, built by Microsoft and Ecolab,  to assess the true value of water and risk exposure  you face. We are committed to becoming a water positive company by 2030 and helping other companies on their journeys. “We hope that our circular  economy investments and  approaches will inspire the  broader sector in the same  way as our carbon negative  goal. Everyone must do  their part.” Every year, people consume 100 billion tons of materials,  and in 2020 only 8.6 percent of those materials were  cycled back into the economy after use, according to the  2021 Circularity Gap Report. Linear systems and existing  infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and  redistribute materials effectively for a global circular  economy. As a result, waste, including plastics, e-waste,  and food waste, pollutes our land, clogs our waterways,  depletes natural resources, and contaminates the air  we breathe. We recognize the urgent need to protect the world’s  biodiversity and ecosystems, give equal access to a safe  and healthy environment, reduce carbon emissions  associated with the creation and end-of-life of these  materials, and meet the needs of a growing population. As a company that makes and manufactures devices,  as well as uses manufactured goods in our campuses,  datacenters, and operations, we have an obligation to  responsibly source materials and an opportunity to build  a more circular approach into our work and the world. To reach our commitment to become a zero waste  company by 2030, we are taking an increasingly circular  approach to materials management to reduce waste  and carbon emissions. Our strategy goes beyond waste  diversion as we work across our value chain beginning  with design and material selection. Wherever possible,  we reduce the amount of materials needed. We responsibly source materials for our operations,  products, and packaging. We are increasing the use of  recycled content, selecting recyclable or compostable  materials, reducing hazardous substances, and designing  out waste. We keep products and materials in use longer  through reuse, repair, and recycling programs. By 2025, we will eliminate single-use plastics in  all Microsoft primary product packaging and all  IT asset packaging in our datacenters. We will design Surface devices, Xbox products and  accessories, and all Microsoft product packaging to  be 100 percent recyclable in OECD countries by 2030. We will achieve 90 percent diversion of operational  waste at datacenters and campuses and 75 percent  diversion for all construction and deconstruction  projects by 2030. We will partner with companies around the world  to drive circular economy innovation and adoption  of technologies to reduce waste and reuse materials  and products. We have planned five Circular Centers, with  Amsterdam open, construction underway  in Boydton, Virginia, and three more to be  added in Dublin, Chicago, and Singapore  in 2022. This has projected savings of  $100 million per year once fully scaled and  will enable 90 percent reuse by 2025. In FY21, we diverted more than 15,200 metric  tons of solid waste otherwise headed to  landfills and incinerators across our direct  operational footprint. We transformed our waste accounting using  Microsoft technology, including PowerApps,  Dynamics 365, and Power BI, increasing our  collection of actual waste data and providing  greater visibility into waste types. We reduced single-use plastics in our  Microsoft product packaging by 18 percent  or from 5.7 percent to 4.7 percent by weight  (on average) of plastic per package in FY21. We achieved a 97 percent recyclable  Xbox Series X and S, and a 93 percent  recyclable metal Surface Laptop 4,  in Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) countries per  the UL methodology ECVP 2789. We introduced two new accessories that are  made in part from recycled waste materials:  several new Xbox Wireless Controllers, built  using over 30 percent post-consumer recycled  (PCR) materials; and the Ocean Plastic Mouse,  which has a plastic shell made with 20 percent  recycled ocean plastic. Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified,  with new certifications for the San Antonio,  Texas and Quincy, Washington datacenters  and renewed certifications for our Boydton,  Virginia and Dublin, Ireland locations. Eleven campuses now have customized  roadmaps to achieve zero waste by 2030. Our Puget Sound campus has been Zero  Waste certified since 2016. We invested in circular economy startup  Rheaply to help companies measure  carbon emissions savings from reuse  and fuel the circular economy. Waste Table 1  Working towards our target to divert 90 percent of operational solid waste from landfills and  incinerators across our owned datacenters and campuses  
In FY21, our diversion rate remained nearly flat from FY20, and we diverted more than 12,600 metric tons of waste  from being landfilled or incinerated. Employees working from home was one of the main drivers of the decrease  of over 44.4 percent in total waste generated. a. Waste generation values and classifications have been updated for FY19 and FY20 to be  consistent with data collection and estimation methodology improvements established in  FY21. As we continue improving our waste accounting, our reported values may change. Waste Table 2  Ensuring 90 percent of servers and components for all cloud hardware will be reused by 2025  
The main drivers of our reuse percentage are the functional equipment that is remarketed (either whole or  parted-out), or materials that could be reused after the recycling process. In FY21, a reduction in the volume  of decommissioned assets and increase in the volume of recyclable material in the mix contributed to the  overall reduction in the reuse percentage. Expansion of our Circular Centers program and investments in systems  and policy changes will further enable us to achieve our 90 percent reuse target of servers and components by 2025.  
a. Our program and supplier data quality has consistently improved over the years. Access to more  accurate data has helped us update our methodology for percentage reuse calculation. For consistency,  previously reported years have been updated to reflect latest methodology applied to FY21. To meet our commitment to being  zero waste by 2030, we are reducing,  reusing, and diverting waste in our  campuses and datacenters. We are  also focused on keeping our products  and packaging in use longer by  designing for circularity. Our operations are a considerable part of our waste  footprint. Getting to zero waste requires more ambitious  efforts to reduce as much waste as we can, reuse  products to extend use life, and recycle or compost  wherever possible, as well as thinking through everything  from visitor badges to server racks with circularity  in mind. At Microsoft, we have taken a first-of-a-kind approach  towards designing and implementing circularity into  our cloud, aligning our end-of-life dispositioning  processes with an integrated plan across the entire  supply chain. It starts with sustainable design and  responsible sourcing of an asset. We use our assets as  long as we can effectively, then reuse what we can to  extend hardware life. After decommissioning, we move  towards a diversified approach, ensuring that assets are  dispositioned to optimize value, security, compliance,  and sustainability. Over the past year, we engaged new  suppliers who are able to remanufacture assets and  components, effectively enabling new lifecycles for our  assets. We have successfully demonstrated takeback/  buyback models with our original asset suppliers, closing  the loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or  reuse assets and components, returning higher financial  benefits as well as significant sustainability outcomes for  carbon emissions reduction and material recovery. We have built Circular Centers inside our large datacenter  campuses to intercept and process all decommissioned  assets. These include an intelligent disposition and  routing system using Azure SQL, Power BI, and  Embedded Power Apps integrated with Dynamics  365, which determines the optimal route for every  component, creating a plan for every part, extending  useful lifecycles well beyond the datacenter, and  engaging our upstream and downstream suppliers. The Circular Centers are also a significant contributor  to our spares program, using harvested components  from decommissioned assets to repair cloud hardware. Increasingly, such approaches are creating more value  and enabling greater resilience across our supply chain. Our circular cloud will enable 90 percent reuse of  datacenter hardware by 2025, significantly contributing  to our goal of achieving zero waste datacenters by 2030  and goal of more than 50 percent emissions reduction  by 2030. A critical piece of achieving our zero waste goal is  managing e-waste from our growing datacenters. Last year, we piloted a new approach to asset reuse  by building a Circular Center within our Amsterdam  datacenter campus, which represents 7 percent of our  server capacity globally. We process decommissioned  cloud hardware to service strategic routes, secondary  markets, and suppliers, using intelligent routing software  in combination with Dynamics 365. Over the past year, our Amsterdam Circular Center model  has achieved 83 percent reuse and 17 percent recycling  of cloud hardware. Based on the success of the pilot,  we’re expanding to five additional campuses in the US  (Boydton, Chicago, Quincy), EMEA (Dublin), and APAC  (Singapore) regions, and extending this model to most  of our cloud computing assets. This program should  achieve 90 percent reuse by 2025 with projected savings  of approximately $100 million each year, once scaled. We also seized opportunities to become more resilient,  build better ties with communities, and increase  collaboration with upstream and downstream partners. We’re bridging the skills divide in our datacenter  communities by supporting technical training programs  at community colleges, vocational schools, and  other education institutions. This work depends on  decommissioned and excess datacenter equipment  to facilitate the “hands-on” labs called Datacenter  Academies in datacenter communities. Microsoft has a goal to achieve 90 percent diversion of  datacenter operational waste by 2030. To reach this goal,  we’re working closely with our waste haulers to optimize  waste diversion programs across our global datacenter  portfolio. We’re also partnering with third-party industry  experts to investigate options for hard-to-recycle  materials, such as air filters used in our datacenters. Exploring innovative partnerships and solutions to  reduce waste and transition to a circular economy are  key strategies for achieving our 2030 goal. In FY21, we  achieved Zero Waste certifications for our San Antonio,  Texas and Quincy, Washington datacenters and renewed  certifications for our Boydton, Virginia and Dublin,  Ireland locations. We’ve created a roadmap for key zero waste initiatives for  each campus and committed to Zero Waste certifications  by 2030 for all Microsoft campuses. LinkedIn’s new  campus in Omaha opened in 2021 with a focus on zero  waste, which led to the team utilizing reclaimed wood  wherever possible, including tabletops, lockers, and  stairs. 52 percent of the wood on the project is reclaimed  and the remaining 48 percent is FSC certified. Microsoft has a goal of 75 percent construction waste  diversion for all projects and 90 percent for campus  projects over 75,000 square feet. To reach these goals,  Microsoft and LinkedIn are refining RFIs for vendors,  standardizing waste tracking and reporting, and  establishing a decommissioning partner to ensure that  our used furniture and materials are reused. Our Puget  Sound campus modernization project included  deconstructing 12 existing buildings. We found multiple reuse opportunities, including using  concrete waste for temporary roads and fill for the new  campus, and recycling ceiling and carpet tiles into new  tiles. Our Puget Sound project is currently achieving over  90 percent diversion. Last year, we began the rollout of recyclable paper visitor  badges to Microsoft sites globally, which will help avoid  seven tons of plastic waste annually. Additionally, we’re  establishing new programs to reduce food waste, other  single-use plastics, and virgin finite materials. Across Asia,  sites like Singapore are utilizing sustainable meal boxes  to cut down on waste generation. Similarly in Japan,  a new reusable cup initiative launched in July 2020 has  completely phased out disposable cups and is estimated  to potentially save 960,000 paper cups annually. Our Istanbul site is using solar powered compost tanks  to reduce waste by 1,000 kg each month. Zero waste for our devices and packaging means taking a  circular economy approach to design out waste and keep  materials in use longer. We are extending the lifespan of  our devices through programs like “Design for Repair”;  we are designing our devices and packaging to use fewer  materials and to be increasingly recyclable; and we are  supporting reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling  infrastructure to ensure that Microsoft devices are kept in  use longer. We’re also increasing use of recycled material  in our own devices, accessories, and packaging. In October 2021, we launched the Ocean Plastic Mouse  which has a shell made with 20 percent recycled ocean  plastic, the first consumer electronics application of this  material. Going beyond just ocean-bound plastic, which  is plastic that is collected within 50 km from shorelines,  each mouse contains resin made from recycled  water bottles taken directly out of oceans, beaches,  and waterways. The launch of the Ocean Plastic Mouse is a small step on  our longer journey to use innovative recycled materials. The resin is now available for others to use in their  own products to help address the global challenge of  ocean plastic. Over the past year, we have used more post-consumer  recycled (PCR) plastics in our products, including Surface  power supply units, Surface devices, Xbox consoles and  controllers, and PC accessories. With the new Electric Volt and Daystrike Camo Special  Edition controllers, we incorporated 30 percent PCR  resins into the external housing and 50 percent PCR  in the internal midframe for the first time in any Xbox  hardware. Following in their footsteps came the Aqua  Shift controller, four variations of the Space Jam New  Legacy controllers, and our Xbox Design Lab series of  controllers. These controllers contain a portion of resins  made from recycled materials like automotive headlight  covers, plastic water jugs, and CDs. Our testing shows  the materials provide the same controller durability and  performance gamers have come to expect. With the  re-launch of our Xbox Design Labs, we have incorporated  the same PCR resins into 75 percent of all Xbox Design  Lab controllers. Starting in late 2021, Xbox Series S became our first  console to incorporate PCR resins into the manufacturing  of the body and various internal components. To date,  we have incorporated approximately 28 percent PCR  into the product’s overall design without compromising  quality or durability. We are now investigating ways  to incorporate more PCR into the design along with  reducing wall thickness to utilize less material overall. Zero waste for our devices and  packaging means taking a circular  economy approach to design  out waste and keep materials  in use longer. We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing  scrap in aluminum production, allowing us to use lower- carbon, 100 percent post-industrial recycled closed loop  aluminum for future Surface computer housings. For our  neodymium magnets, a rare earth material, we are  also exploring post-industrial scrap as a manufacturing  feedstock, which would enable us to produce 100 percent  recycled neodymium in magnets for future products. Textiles at Microsoft are normally used on Surface  palm rests and type covers. However, given the unique  challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experimented  with scrap Alcantara fabric and repurposed it into  a product engineered to be a reusable, premium,  and comfortable three-layer face covering for  Microsoft employees. Traditionally, many materials used in the production of  devices are made using industry-standard computer  numerical control (CNC) manufacturing. With CNC,  the shape of the product component is cut out of a  large block of raw materials after which the excess is  discarded. To reduce waste in production, we have  started to introduce material “stamping” techniques in  our manufacturing which instead mold the raw materials  to the desired end shape. For our new Surface Laptop  Studio, stamping reduced our manufacturing aluminum  scrap rate for the product’s base by at least 25 percent. Repairability and serviceability can extend the lifespan of  our devices. In 2021, our Design for Repair engineering  program helped launch the Surface Pro 8, the Surface  Laptop Studio, and Surface Laptop SE, which are  considered to be some of the most repairable devices in  their product lines with replaceable displays, batteries,  keyboards, and more. We have also established a  growing Authorized Service Provider (ASP) network to  expand customer repairs across countries including the  United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France. We recently partnered with iFixit to offer service tools  for Surface devices to iFixit Pro independent repairers,  Microsoft Authorized Service Providers, Microsoft  Experience Centers, and Microsoft Commercial  customers which can be purchased directly from  iFixit. Our goal is to continue to expand safe, secure,  and sustainable repair options for our Surface and  Xbox devices. Microsoft has also committed to hiring an independent  consultant to conduct a study on the sustainability  benefits of repairable Surface and Xbox devices,  including impacts on carbon emissions and waste. Microsoft will publicly post a summary of our findings  on our website by May 2022. As we make progress on our 100 percent recyclable  packaging goal for all devices by 2030, our Ocean Plastic  Mouse and new Surface Slim Pen, available in 2021, are  the first of our products to ship in 100 percent recyclable  and plastic-free packaging. The Ocean Plastic Mouse  packaging is comprised of 20 percent wood fiber, which is  sustainably forested, and 80 percent Bagasse fiber, a fast- growing and highly regenerative bio-renewable material. The packaging for our holiday 2021 Surface products— such as Surface Duo 2 and Surface Pro 8—are 99 percent  recyclable on average. And, starting with our Surface  Laptop 4 packaging launched in April 2021, all of our new  packaging is made with 100 percent sustainably forested  content as certified by the Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC). We also eliminated a single-use plastic product,  converting our Xbox gift cards from plastic to paperboard,  reducing over 500,000 kg of plastic annually. Driven in large part by both materials selection and  designing for disassembly—a natural byproduct of  designing for repair—we produced a Surface Laptop  4 (metal version) that is 93 percent recyclable in OECD  countries by UL standard ECVP 2789. Our Xbox Series X and  S were also found to be 97 percent recyclable as a part of  Microsoft expanding its recyclability commitment to also  include Xbox and Xbox accessories. Complex flame retardants, additives, and polymer grades  used in consumer electronics make recycling of many  plastics at end-of-life difficult. Microsoft is collaborating  with suppliers in the industry to explore a closed loop supply  chain for these difficult-to-recycle materials. Using end-of- life plastic material from Xbox consoles, PC accessories, and  more, we’ve created a new closed-loop recycled resin that  is being evaluated for use in upcoming products. We have focused on enabling responsible end- of-life with our devices, processes, and materials. To ensure products are kept in use longer, Microsoft  and our partners work to repurpose or recycle used  devices through several programs while encouraging  consumers to engage with recycling programs in  their own communities. Examples include Microsoft’s  Devices Trade-In Program, our Microsoft Authorized  Refurbisher Program (MAR), and our voluntary mailback  recycling program. We believe that Microsoft’s most  important contribution to waste  reduction will come not from our  own work alone, but by helping our  customers, partners, and suppliers  around the world reduce their waste  footprints through our learnings  and with the power of data, AI, and  digital technology. Implementing a circular model that minimizes waste  requires interventions up and down the value chain— innovative design, materials, service business models,  reuse and redistribution processes, collection, processing,  and more. To achieve multiple uses for a material, many of these  levers need to be used at once and require coordination  with a diverse set of stakeholders. Technology can play a  role in bringing data transparency of material flows and  connectivity for business and consumer engagements. We believe that Microsoft’s most important contribution  to waste reduction will not come from our own work  alone, but by helping our customers, partners, and  suppliers around the world reduce their waste footprint  through our learning and with the power of data, AI,  and digital technology. That said, our own operations are our best laboratory  for innovation. In FY21, we invested to digitize waste  data across the company and identified opportunities to  improve data collection. We used Microsoft technology  to track and report on materials and waste, developing  PowerApps for facility managers, APIs to directly connect  with recycling vendors, Dynamics 365 to aggregate bulk  data, and the Power BI platform to visualize data across  portfolios. We now have more consistent, high-quality  data about the amount of waste, the type and quality,  where it is generated, and where it goes, informing  strategy to achieve our targets. We are dedicated to using our technology to help  customers, partners, and suppliers around the world  reduce their waste footprints through our learnings and  with the power of data, AI, and digital technology. Startup Karo Sambhav is taking on the seemingly  impossible task of formalizing India’s e-waste economy. Roughly 7,200 tons of e-waste lands in India’s capital  city from across the country and abroad every day. When a team collects a waste shipment from an  aggregator, its members upload photographs and  
details into an app. This information is hosted securely  on Microsoft Azure. Karo Sambhav is operating in  28 states and three union territories in the country  today. It had engaged with more than 500 companies  and government institutions, 22,700 schools, 5,000  informal sector aggregators, and 800 repair shops as of  December 2020 and was able to collect and send about  12,000 metric tons of e-waste for responsible recycling. 8 Plastic Credit Exchange (PCX), a nonprofit organization  with origins in the Philippines, partnered with Microsoft  to develop a blockchain-protected credit registry  for the first global nonprofit plastic offset program,  effectively reducing the flow of plastic waste into our  landfills and oceans. PCX has built a wide ecosystem  of partners to facilitate the recovery, transport, and  processing of post-consumer plastic waste, seeking  out the most environmentally recommended solutions  available. The company undergoes verification via a  third-party audit using its Plastic Pollution Reduction  Standard and results are made public through an  online registry. PCX now uses a Microsoft Azure-based  blockchain solution to provide confidence, traceability,  and transparency within its ecosystem. By the end of  2021, PCX is projected to have enabled the removal  of approximately 37 million kilograms of plastic waste  from the environment. 10  
Australian businesses export around 6,700 consignments  of waste each year. As of January 2021, the Australian  Department of Agriculture, Water, and the Environment  (DAWE) requires that any business that wants to export  waste glass must apply for a license. Working with  Atturra and Microsoft, DAWE created a digital platform  using Dynamics 365 to streamline the application  process for both exporters and department personnel  while keeping data secure and private. The system also  provides detailed national-level data on exports of waste  in near-real time, improving Australia’s understanding of  the evolving circular economy and providing an evidence  base for future policies. H&M Group is on a mission to lead the charge towards  a more sustainable fashion future. As part of its efforts,  in March 2020 the Group launched Treadler, a B2B service  that offers access to H&M Group’s supply chain to other  
fashion brands across the industry. Treadler’s clients  will have the necessary data to make more sustainable  product development, sourcing, production, and  logistics decisions. From selecting materials to choosing  suppliers and factories, these sustainable choices can  be traced across the H&M Group’s global supply chain  and put towards global sustainability goals for the  entire fashion industry. Microsoft supported Treadler  in the development of its technology infrastructure  and backbone. To ensure deployment was fast, Treadler  was supported by the Microsoft team to help guide  a successful and efficient implementation. Treadler is  also rolling out a dashboard that will help clients better  consider manufacturing impacts as they place orders,  and provide information about the sustainability  performance to make even more informed decisions  about sustainability. BeachBot uses AI to spot cigarette butts, pluck them out, and dispose of them in a safe bin. Every year, 4.5 trillion cigarette butts end up in the  environment. When water touches discarded cigarette  butts, the filters leach more than 30 chemicals that are  highly toxic to aquatic organisms. TechTics is working  on a solution to resolve this environmental and social  issue with technology. It has built a mobile beach- cleaning machine called BeachBot, which uses AI with  the help of Azure infrastructure and Microsoft Trove to  spot cigarette butts, pick them up, and dispose of them  in a safe bin. The beach rover’s AI system is trained to  recognize cigarette butts, based on photos submitted via  Trove by the public. This responsible approach to AI helps  contributors to the project feel like they are part of a  larger community tackling cleanup in their environments. By the end of 2021, PCX  is projected to have  enabled the removal  of approximately  37 million kilograms  of plastic waste from  the environment. We are focused on new ways to  harness the power of technology,  partnerships, and investments to drive  impact at scale and pace to help the  world more effectively transform to  a circular economy. Circular materials management requires all stakeholders  to participate in the transition from discarding materials  to reusing them. Appropriate infrastructure and  technology are important factors needed to actualize  this vision while minimizing environmental impact. To enable and accelerate the circular economy, the world  must consider what materials are used, how goods are  manufactured, how products are used and reused, how  and where materials are collected at end-of-life, and how  they are brought back into the supply chain. The Climate Innovation Fund (CIF) invests in technologies  and processes that can reduce the amount of waste  generated by repurposing waste into other usable  materials and products and enabling the continuous safe  use of natural resources. In 2021, we invested in Rheaply, a technology-enabled  platform that brings together companies, government,  educational institutions, and more to generate increased  visibility and circularity of physical assets. Rheaply allows  for transfers of materials that may otherwise go to waste  and is building insights around waste diversion and  embodied carbon emissions saved on the platform. In FY21, we kicked off an internal pilot with Rheaply  to better understand the opportunity for creating an  internal hardware reuse program. We aim to extend  the life of internal hardware turned in for recycling,  creating a standardized, scalable, traceable, and circular  program for our assets prior to responsibly recycling. We are also seeing impact from our 2020 Closed Loop  Partners fund investments, including the following  developments in their portfolio. HomeBiogas (HBG), based in Israel, is a leader in  developing affordable, simple-to-use biogas systems,  enabling people and businesses around the globe to turn  their own organic waste into renewable energy and liquid  fertilizer on site. A typical household can save six tons of  CO2 emissions a year with the entry-level biogas system. HBG serves over 10,000 households across more than  100 countries. The company has improved the circularity  of the products themselves—lengthening the shelf life  to over 15 years, and making the materials used for the  digester 100 percent recyclable. Closed Loop Partners,  an early investor of HBG, currently represents the largest  ownership stake in the company, which currently trades  on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. 8  
Balcones Resources, the largest privately held recycling  company in Texas, became the Closed Loop Leadership  Fund’s inaugural investment in October 2019. As part of  Balcones’ growth strategy to build best-in-class recycling  operations across the southern United States, the  company closed a bolt-on acquisition of Single Stream  Recyclers (SSR) in 2020. SSR is the first AI-powered  recycling company in the United States. Balcones’s facility  in Austin, Texas processed 136,000 tons of high-quality  recyclable materials in 2020, including 80,000 tons of  paper, more than 20,000 tons of glass, and at least 4,000  tons of plastics. 8 Through our AI for Earth program, we are supporting  startups and nonprofits using cloud, data, and AI to  accelerate the pace of innovation in waste, including  the following projects. The University of Connecticut is applying AI to detect  construction changes between the years of 2014, 2017,  and 2020 in Shanghai, China. The purpose is to find out  whether demolition and relocation has led to substantial  waste of resources. Let’s Do It Foundation has developed an AI algorithm  for detecting trash in geolocated images. Today, the  algorithm is surveying images all over the world, locating  waste on a global scale so that a network of cleanup  teams and local municipalities can target the most  affected locations. Recycleye uses AI and robotics to revolutionize the waste  management industry, accelerating the world’s transition to the  circular economy. In 2021, Recycleye scaled from research and  development to commercialization with strategic and technical  support from Microsoft. The company brings greater transparency  
to the waste management industry by detecting materials on a waste  management facility’s conveyor belts to deploy automated sorting. Their operating system is built on Microsoft Azure, ensuring data  and model security, as well as scale. To train the Recycleye Vision  computer vision solution, millions of images and data points have  been collected from waste facilities. As Recycleye’s datasets continue  to grow, the company can easily scale up its Azure resources in line  with requirements. Transitioning to a global circular economy takes an  ecosystem of aligned partners. We seek transformational  partnerships that help develop and deliver research,  guidance, and implementation roadmaps that enable  the circular economy. In July 2021, we advanced our relationship with the  Ellen MacArthur Foundation from Member to Partner,  elevating opportunities for Microsoft employees to learn  and engage on topics of the circular economy through  community platforms, workshops, events, courses,  and collaborative projects. In January 2021, Microsoft kicked off a project with  members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network  (including Aquafil, BASF, Berry Global, CHEP/Brambles,  Cisco, the Estée Lauder Companies, Flex, Mainetti, Mondi,  and SCG) to create a circular packaging solution to  replace the existing linear path plastic-based stretch wrap  that is used to stabilize and protect products in transit. This cross-sectoral group is researching and piloting  three different pathways to eliminate single-use stretch  wrap used in a linear path: replacing stretch plastic with  a compostable film, implementing reusable materials for  securing pallets, and improving the recovery of single- use, linear plastic-based film for higher value and closed  loop recycling solutions. The pilots and results will be  detailed in a white paper to be published in Q2 of 2022. In January 2021, Microsoft became a founding member  of the Capital Equipment Coalition North America  alongside DLL, GE Digital, Philips, and SAP and in  partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  Foundation and the Platform for Accelerating the Circular  Economy (PACE). We joined the Coalition to support the  capital equipment industry’s acceleration to a closed  loop model that preserves and recovers the value of  materials across a product’s lifecycle, leading to reduced  waste and carbon emissions. As a group, we’re working  towards circularity standards and methodology that  measures the environmental impacts of “X as a Service”  models compared to traditional ownership models. Microsoft is  collaborating with  10 other companies to  test circular packaging  solutions to replace  stretch wrap packaging. An alliance of international organizations and their  member companies, the Circular Electronics Partnership  is committed to driving a coordinated transition  towards a sustainable and economically viable circular  industry by creating alignment, avoiding duplication,  and stimulating ambitious circular action across the  electronics value chain. The Partnership builds off the  collaboration that produced A New Vision for Circular  Electronics and convenes seven global organizations  and their respective members: the Global Electronics  Council (GEC), the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative  (GeSI), International Telecommunications Union (ITU),  Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE),  Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), World Business  Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and  World Economic Forum (WEF). The partnership is the  first time that experts, business leaders, and international  organizations will co-design solutions around the  circular electronics industry and will establish a network  to elevate the action and ambition of the industry in a  coordinated way. Implementing circularity activities like purchasing  recycled materials, offering a service model, or  keeping materials in use longer can reduce the  embodied carbon of materials. Circularity plays  a key role in reaching our carbon negative  commitment to reduce our Scope 3 emissions  by half by 2030. Circular economy initiatives do not share a  standard method of measurement across  industries or product types and may not always  accurately represent environmental impact. To scale implementation in the long term, we  need the enabling infrastructure to measure,  monitor, and verify material origin and flows. In FY21, we invested to digitize waste data across  the company. We now have more consistent,  higher-quality data about the amount of waste,  its type and quality, where it is generated, and  where it goes. As we implemented waste data  tools across the entire company, we saved time  collecting and reporting this data from our  cross-company sustainability managers  to executive leadership, to customers and  regulatory bodies. To date, the primary focus of a circular economy  has been on the “economy” aspect. Equity is  equally as important, and we need to focus on  a just transition for every person, organization,  and community. The world must address the  disproportionate effects of upstream resource  extraction and downstream waste management  and pollution. It is critical to develop a strategy  that ensures under-represented and under- resourced communities are not left behind in  the transition to a circular economy. Planning for waste interventions must be  considered throughout the value chain and by  location. Upstream decisions like procurement  and use of materials affect downstream  management and processing of materials  as eventual waste. Location also affects zero  waste implementation, and a certain degree of  customization can ensure alignment to global  efforts while contextualizing the program for  local realities. While there are best practices  that can be shared and replicated on a global  scale, there are unique characteristics for each  campus, such as its local infrastructure, size, or  dining services. Creating a localized approach to  zero waste drives local ownership and program  effectiveness, while also laddering up to a  global target. We will scale programs such as our Circular  Centers and the elimination of single-use plastics  from packaging for Microsoft products and  within our supply chain. Across the company,  we are using baseline data to inform annual  roadmaps that will result in meaningful  environmental outcomes for our employees,  consumers, and the diverse communities in  which we operate. We will work upstream to develop better  materials, including recycled materials, and  ensure contracts are in place to support circular  processes. We are also contracting with suppliers  to engage in reverse logistics models and take- back programs for waste reduction and reuse  of packaging materials. From downstream  waste haulers, we are contractually requesting  data transparency, optimization of services,  and waste sorting education to promote zero  waste outcomes. We will help to drive standardization across  circularity standards within the Capital  Equipment Coalition and use our voice to  coalesce industries towards a set of principles  to promote circular economy progress. There is  an opportunity for cross-industry collaboration  for waste and circularity data standards, including  a framework for capturing reliable and consistent  data and methodologies. We are continually exploring design changes,  material selection, and business processes to  facilitate deep embodied carbon reductions  across our operations and products. We are  analyzing the optimal use of conventional  materials, such as concrete and steel, and  pursuing more ambitious opportunities with  emerging alternative materials that carry  significantly less embodied carbon. Building on our FY21 work to transform our  waste accounting, we will continue to improve  our waste data tools so they more accurately  model business activity. The ability to forecast  environmental impacts will drive upstream  sustainable decision-making that minimizes  waste and associated carbon emissions. It will  also help us understand the environmental  impacts of circularity practices like reuse, repair,  redistribution, and recycling. We are exploring  the best methods to account for this, such as  measuring the per-year and absolute carbon  footprint of a product. In FY22, as new recycling initiatives are deployed  at the Circular Centers, we are focused on  further iterating operational procedures and  training for zero waste practices. We are also  building design guidelines for engineers that  define principles for circular, low-carbon hardware. Our work around recycled content, repairability,  recyclability, and material efficiency continues to  grow. Our framework for circularity will account  for each phase of the device lifecycle and align  with leading industry reporting standards and  forthcoming circularity legislation. We will  also continue expanding programs, such as  the Microsoft mailback program, to ensure  consumers around the world have access to an  easy, convenient, and free service for returning  their Microsoft branded devices and packaging  for reuse, refurbishment, or recycling. By the  end of FY22, Microsoft plans to implement the  mailback program in 40 countries. We are deploying new Circular Centers in Dublin,  Chicago, and Singapore by July 2022. We also  plan to launch a Circular Center in Quincy,  Washington in 2022, followed by Sweden in  2025. Working with our internal and external  partners, we will develop new dispositions  that maximize reuse and minimize waste. In addition, we are exploring additional circularity  functionality, such as harvesting for spares and  warranty reuse, scaling buyback to network  hardware, and providing recycling support—  all of which can be performed at the Circular  Centers. We are also working with our logistics  packaging partners to reduce single-use plastic  in packaging and transition to recyclable and  compostable packaging. Learn more at the U.S. Chamber Foundation’s open  forum to reduce the environmental footprint of  the capital equipment sector through goal setting,  information-sharing, and collaboration. Find out more about the circular economy and  the vision for an economic system that’s better  for the people and the environment. We are committed to becoming a zero waste company by 2030 and helping other companies on their journeys. Ecosystems  “Only when we have a  massive amount of planetary  data and compute at a  similar scale can we begin  to answer one of the most  complex questions ever  posed—how do we manage  natural resources equitably  and sustainably for a  prosperous and climate- stable future?” Healthy ecosystems are critical for a healthy planet  —environmental sustainability can’t exist without  ecosystem sustainability. Unhealthy ecosystems, created  or exacerbated by climate change and biodiversity  collapse, threaten our entire civilization. And yet,  according to the latest United Nations Intergovernmental  Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem  Services (IPBES-8) study, the health of ecosystems on  which we and all other species depend is deteriorating  more rapidly than previously thought. Put simply, we  are eroding the very foundations of our economies,  livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of  life worldwide. Microsoft recognizes that ecosystems are the thread  that connects all our sustainability commitments. Ecosystems are where we invest in carbon sequestration  projects that help us achieve carbon negativity, they are  the watersheds we commit to protect and replenish,  and they are where waste is ultimately diverted. We need  a strong, efficient, scalable way to monitor, understand,  measure, and ultimately manage the impact of our  actions or inactions on ecosystems—both globally  and locally. In the past year, Microsoft has made considerable  progress towards its leading ecosystem commitments  of protecting more land than we use and delivering  our Planetary Computer to provide access to the world’s  critical environmental datasets and to function as a  computing platform that enables partners to measure,  monitor, model, and manage healthy ecosystems. We will aggregate environmental data from around  the world and put it to work through computing  and machine learning in a new Planetary Computer. We will support and advocate for public policy  initiatives that measure and manage ecosystems  at the national and global scale. We will take responsibility for the ecosystem  impacts of our direct operations by protecting  more land than we use by 2025. We will use the Planetary Computer to develop  and deploy the digital technology that helps our  partners and customers with environmental  decision-making in their organizational activities. In FY21, we contracted to protect more than 17,000  acres of land. This puts us on a path to exceed our  commitment to protect more land than we use by  more than 5,000 acres. The Planetary Computer private preview released  as planned in April 2021, with more than 500 users  signed up and using the APIs and scalable compute. We have made available 24 petabytes of data  with more than 30 key environmental and Earth  observation datasets to Azure in consistent,  analysis-ready format that is freely available  for use by anyone. Since its inception in 2017, our AI for Earth program  has provided more than 850 grants to organizations  working in 110 countries around the world, granting  more than $20 million in Azure credits. We partnered with subject matter experts to use  the power of the Planetary Computer to develop a  growing set of applications that enable data-driven  decision-making for the environment, ranging from  conservation planning and forest risks to land cover  and classification. In FY21, we contracted to protect more than 17,200 acres, which is 50 percent more than the land we use to operate. Microsoft directly operates on  approximately 11,000 acres of land  around the world, and we recognize  that our own land footprint has an  impact on ecosystems. We have made a commitment to permanently protect  more land than we use by 2025. We are also looking at  ways for our datacenters to integrate and give back to  the natural environment. Since making this commitment in April 2020, we  identified two leading land protection organizations,  the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) within  the United States and The Nature Conservancy (TNC)  globally, to partner with to achieve our commitment to  protect more land than we use. We used a data-informed  approach to identify ecosystems most at risk, using TNC’s  last chance ecosystem framework and NFWF’s national  landscape conservation framework. We also prioritize  projects that have the support and involvement of local  and indigenous populations. In FY21, we contracted for projects that will help protect  more than 17,000 acres of land, including the following  
We contributed to the purchase of the Maya Forest  land, one of the largest remaining tropical forests in the  Americas outside of the . The approximately  236,000 acres secures a vital wildlife corridor in Central  America’s dwindling forests. This area is critical for the  protection of iconic wildlife species, such as jaguars and  ocelots, and preserves a significant living carbon reserve. We contributed to the purchase of permanent  conservation easements in Montana, Colorado, New  Mexico, and Nevada that will protect the migration  corridors for species of greatest conservation need,  including mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and moose. This effort also allows apex predators to thrive,  including mountain lions, grizzly bears, and Canada  lynx. Providing contiguous protected lands is crucial  for enabling the successful migration of these wide- ranging species. As we expand our operational footprint with new  datacenters, our approach includes work to find  ways for our datacenters to give back to the natural  environment. Understanding how we can provide the  same (or better) performance as an intact ecosystem  starts with understanding how an ecosystem performs  on its own. We have begun assessment of ecosystem  performance in 12 datacenter regions, to be completed  by end of 2021. Through this research, we are quantifying  ecosystem performance in terms of services including  water quantity and quality, air, carbon, climate, soil  health, human health and wellbeing, and biodiversity. The goal is to renew and revitalize the surrounding  area—resulting in mutual, regenerative value for the  local community and environment. We measure this in percentages of intact ecosystems,  meaning the higher the percentage, the more effective  we are at meeting nature’s benchmark for the area. The findings are helping to inform one of our first  projects in North Holland, which is part of our  Amsterdam datacenter region. Around the datacenters,  we will construct lowland forested areas as well as  forested wetlands, which are highly saturated with water  and vegetation suited for water filtration to naturally  process storm water and runoff. Modeled results from  these different approaches suggest that ecosystem  performance can be restored to as much as 75 percent  (where we are able to successfully recreate 75 percent  of the function of the untouched ecosystem). The Maya Forest land is one of the largest remaining tropical forests in the Americas  outside of the . We will exceed our  commitment to protect  more land than we use by  contracting for more land  protection, putting us on  path to exceed our goal by  50 percent. We believe that Microsoft’s most  important contribution to protecting  ecosystems and biodiversity is  delivering the Planetary Computer,  which provides access to the world’s  critical environmental datasets, AI,  and digital technology. Our land footprint is relatively small, which is why  we also focus on using our technology to support  ecosystem health. We believe that our biggest contribution to the  protection of ecosystems is to identify, invest in, and  orchestrate a coherent cloud infrastructure that brings  together all relevant stakeholders and offers best-in- class science-driven tools, AI, digital catalogs of species,  distributed computing frameworks, and global satellite  images. We make these tools cloud-native, bring our  business partners to deploy them to be used, and  build trust by making visible the science roots and the  provenance of the data, while creating best practices for  deployment by deploying ourselves first. We are also  embracing open source, identifying critical petabytes  of satellite images being collected and released as open  data, including the Copernicus satellite programs and  tools like Marxan. The manifestation of this work is what we call the  Planetary Computer. This open-source solution includes  data catalogs, APIs, and applications to empower both  data scientists and environmental scientists to craft  more effective and informed strategies to protect and  restore ecosystems. In April 2021, we released the Planetary Computer, which  enables global-scale environmental monitoring by  combining petabytes of data and spatial analysis tools  to power sustainability applications. It is a platform that  lets users build on the power of the cloud to accelerate  environmental sustainability and Earth science. • The Data Catalog, which includes more than  24 petabytes of data about Earth systems, hosted  on Azure and made available to users for free. • APIs that allow users to search for the data they need  across space and time. Instead of sifting through  millions of files, we index content so any user can ask  
directly for a type of data (for example, “give me all  data from these satellites for Kansas in summer 2020  when it was not cloudy and give me those times on  a specific map projection of the average values”). This vastly reduces the complexity of dealing with  petabytes of data. • The Hub, a managed computing environment  that allows scientists to process massive geospatial  datasets. To date, we have seamlessly deployed more  than 20,000 cluster node workers to support our  user workloads. • Applications, built by our network of partners,  that put the Planetary Computer platform to work  for environmental sustainability, ranging from  conservation planning and forest risk management  to land cover classification. The Planetary Computer uses open-source tools and  supports open standards. In fact, the foundation of the  Planetary Computer is the incredible ecosystem of tools  being developed in the open by our partners and the  much broader open-source community. For example, our  Hub builds on the work done by the Pangeo community  to put the tools of data science to work for the Earth  science community, and our API builds on the work done  by the STAC community to streamline and standardize  the cataloging and discovery of geospatial data. The Planetary Computer API and Planetary Computer  Hub are currently in private preview, accepting a small  set of early users, with plans to go public in mid-2022. All the datasets are available and can be accessed via  Azure Blob Storage. Datasets can be used by developers  working within or outside of our Planetary Computer  Hub. They can integrate each component in their existing  processes or use the full Planetary Computer with one  single experience. We have made  available 24 petabytes  of data with more  than 30 key  environmental and Earth  observation datasets. We partnered with subject matter experts to use  the power of the Planetary Computer to develop  applications that enable data-driven decision-making  for the environment, including the following. In June 2021, Esri published a new high-resolution 2020  Global Land Cover map for users around the world. The 10-Meter Land Cover map is the collaborative result  of compute and Sentinel-2 data from the Microsoft  Planetary Computer and a novel deep learning AI  model developed by Impact Observatory. High- resolution, open, accurate, and timely land cover maps  are critical for decision-makers in many industry sectors  and developing nations, supporting a broad range  of sustainability and conservation efforts. The data  is hosted in ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World and the  Planetary Computer. Conservation Science Partners’ Analytics Lab uses the  Planetary Computer to better visualize ecosystem  monitoring projects and help make the findings more  intuitive and accessible. These mapping applications  assess wildlife habitat connectivity on working  landscapes, anthropogenic impacts to terrestrial  landscapes, and changes in forest structure over time. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is using the Planetary  Computer to protect and manage land, oceans,  and freshwater biodiversity for nature and people. In partnership with Microsoft, TNC is scaling impact and  accelerating conservation with Marxan, a world-leading  decision-support software for spatial conservation  planning. Microsoft and TNC are enabling more  equitable access to Marxan by bringing it to the cloud  with platform development support from Vizzuality. Together we are helping people around the world make  evidence-based decisions more quickly, inclusively, and  transparently to protect the world’s biodiversity. CarbonPlan is using the Planetary Computer to enable  more transparent and scientifically rigorous evaluation  of forest-based climate solutions. By shining a light  on data from past and future carbon offset projects,  procurement programs can better understand the  climate risks of carbon credit purchases. Microsoft used  this application to visualize the climate risks of forest  carbon offsets to help us manage our carbon removal  purchasing program more effectively. Chloris Geospatial uses the Planetary Computer to  generate their “above-ground carbon stock” non- commercial product, which gives anyone the ability  to analyze forest carbon globally. We are focused on new ways to harness  the power of technology, partnerships,  investments, and policy to drive impact  at scale and pace to help the world  protect ecosystems and biodiversity. At Microsoft we know that our actions alone will not  be enough to protect ecosystems and biodiversity. The world will need new partnerships, solutions,  and policies that have the potential to scale rapidly  and globally. To empower organizations working on environmental  challenges, we provide training and access to cloud  and AI technologies. Since its inception in 2017, our AI  for Earth program has provided more than 850 grants  to organizations working in 110 countries around the  world. While initially these grants provided access  to Microsoft cloud services and additional training,  we’ve expanded the program to now include the  Planetary Computer. This past year, we also added  new partners that bring significant new capabilities to  the program. We partnered with the Group on Earth  Observations (GEO) Secretariat to better reach geospatial  researchers and practitioners working at the forefront  of environmental use cases. We launched the $1 million  GEO-Microsoft Planetary Computer grant program to  support early adopters of the Planetary Computer to  apply Earth observations to address environmental and  societal challenges. We selected the first eight grant  recipients in September 2021 who all received access to  the NICFI Satellite Data Program on Azure and launched  a second request for proposals in October 2021 in  partnership with Planet Labs. We partnered with Vale and our Brazilian subsidiary  to build PrevisIA, a solution for NGO Imazon that  anticipates information on regions with a higher risk of  deforestation and wildfires in the  Rainforest  through AI. The open platform analyzes various data  such as topography, land cover, urban infrastructure,  
official and unofficial roads, and socioeconomic  statistics to refine the deforestation risk model and  identify the different types of territories threatened  by deforestation in the  Rainforest including  indigenous lands and conservation units. All the  information is publicly disclosed at a control panel. Public bodies, private companies, and civil society can  plan and carry out preventive actions, combating and  controlling deforestation. Zooniverse is the world’s largest platform for people- powered research, using open source and Azure  technologies to lower the barriers to entry for scientific  discovery. Researchers upload their images, videos, or  
audio files—like camera trap images of wild animals  or satellite imagery of a star —and Zooniverse’s global  community of over 2 million volunteers tags, annotates,  or transcribes the file to aid classification. We partnered with Conservation International and the  National Parks Board of Singapore to develop a mobile  application that helps identify shark and ray species using  technology such as computer vision and AI. This will  enable ground inspectors at national borders to rapidly  assess and identify shark and ray species and seize  products that are suspected to be illegal. We partnered with the Qatar Environment and Energy  Research Institute (QEERI) to build a solution using  remote sensing technologies to detect coastal changes  and predict shorelines and water line evolution for  the next 10, 20, and 50 years. A change detection map  assesses the coastal hazards on urban infrastructure and  population, including the impact of seawater intrusion on  agricultural and food production in the north of Qatar. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) uses Azure to  model human population distribution in dengue- endemic areas to determine the best release locations for  disease-fighting mosquitoes to stop the spread of deadly  dengue fever. Through high-resolution satellite imagery,  demographics, and climate data the model is trained  to provide accurate estimations of spatially-distributed  human population density. This allows WMP experts to  easily develop optimal release strategies for Wolbachia  mosquitoes. Research shows that Wolbachia can  sustain itself in mosquito populations without continual  reapplication, making this a long-term, cost-effective  and self-sustaining approach with no adverse impact on  natural ecosystems. Successful strategies, interventions, and approaches to  improve ecosystem health require a great deal of data  and collaboration across public and private sectors,  as well as civil society. We are taking an ecosystem  approach to ecosystems, creating or broadening our  relationships to provide more people with better access  to this critical information. In 2021, we launched a new partnership with the UN  Biodiversity Lab to help connect remote observations,  field data, and AI/machine learning tools. This work,  powered by the Planetary Computer, will enable  countries to develop richer environmental accounts  and drive better environmental decision-making. Fostering global connections and collaboration will  be critical to address climate change. In the past year,  we broadened our work with the Group on Earth  Observations Biodiversity Observation Network  (GEO BON) to connect with a global network of  scientists to enable a scalable approach to expanding  and accessing biodiversity information and insights. We’re supporting CSIRO in Australia to establish a climate  intelligence platform that puts trusted and credible  climate risk science in the hands of businesses in Australia  and the Asia region and enables them to assess, disclose,  and manage their climate risks. In addition, together with  CSIRO and the University of Reading, we have developed  a research partnership to improve our understanding  and assessment of climate change risk. The Radiant Earth Foundation develops Earth  observation machine learning libraries and models  through an open-source hub to support global  missions like agriculture, conservation, and climate  change. We support Radiant Earth by co-building  some of the key software libraries, making it easy to  bridge to and from the Planetary Computer. We are  also jointly running competitions to improve machine  learning models. We continue to support the OS-Climate initiative,  which is accelerating the development of scenario- based predictive analytic tools and investment products  that manage climate-related risk and finance climate  solutions across every geography, sector, and asset  class. Microsoft is a founding member, contributes  our expertise on climate risk and data, and provides  additional technology support for the development  of new tools and approaches. In 2020, Microsoft joined the World Economic Forum’s  Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network  for ocean innovation and technology in Norway (C4IR  Ocean). Since then, we have expanded our work with  a new project that has us working with C4IR Ocean to  deliver a tracking application for maritime vessels to  forecast GHG emissions from maritime transportation. This information is made available through C4IR’s  Ocean Data Platform for regulators, finance institutions,  and port and coastal authorities to enable data- driven decisions related to the environmental impact  of shipping. Governments play a unique and important role in  measuring and managing ecosystems and biodiversity  as they collect and make publicly available massive  amounts of data critical to environmental science. They also own billions of acres of public land that  they can use to protect, manage, and restore critical  ecosystems. And they establish and implement policies  governing the use and management of natural resources  and ecosystems. Microsoft is advocating for the US Congress to  pass the Growing Climate Solution Act to advance  climate-smart agriculture and nature-based carbon  markets. In addition, Microsoft supported funding  in the Washington state budget to develop high- quality nature-based carbon removal protocols. Microsoft serves on the steering committee of the US  chapter of Trillion Trees and submitted one of the initial  corporate pledges. We have been working with the  organizers on ways to design the initiative in a way that  accelerates reforestation and meaningfully removes  carbon. In Europe, Microsoft supported and engaged  on the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, that aims to  increase protected areas across the EU and to identify  new measures for managing and restoring ecosystems. Microsoft also committed to support a new dedicated  “European Biodiversity Partnership,” Biodiversa+, that will  bring together science, policy, and practice, and support  data-driven research to stop the loss of biodiversity. 2021 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to delivering the Planetary Computer. Whether it’s satellites in the sky or sensors  on the ground, data about the Earth is being  captured at higher resolutions, more often,  with a variety of data formats and purposes. There is also a growing set of model output  and derived products which are large spatial  datasets themselves, valuable to a broad set of  use cases. This creates a deluge of data waiting  to be unlocked for positive environmental  sustainability impact. The organizations that are producing spatial  data know what’s at stake for our ecosystems. They want to see their data utilized to meet the  sustainability challenges we are facing and work  together to enable users to utilize the data in a  common, interoperable manner. 3  Getting data to the cloud is the only way to  scale the work of a broad range of users. Data that exists in the cloud has a huge  advantage over data that must be first  downloaded on a user’s system. Unless you  own a supercomputing system, there is no  way to download and compute over the vast  amount of data needed to scale the analyses  and operationalization of that data. Users need to search the vast amount of data  available to find the data they need and have  easy access to data in the areas and times they  care about. Just because data is available does  not mean it is accessible. There is a growing effort  in the geospatial community to enable access  to cloud-hosted data through utilizing cloud- optimized formats and supplying APIs to search  through standards-based metadata. The scope of the problems facing our world  mean that no one organization or person  will be able to solve them. The easier it is for  governments, academia, and industry to work  together, the faster we can all move in the same  direction. The best mechanism currently for  this collaboration is doing things in the open:  publishing open datasets, using and investing  in open-source software, publishing open  science, and making data accessible through  open standards. We are developing features in the Planetary  Computer that will make it easy to push data to  the cloud and open access to some or all users. Enabling efficient geospatial workflows on Azure  will unlock the power of the massive amount  of data the world is collecting about our Earth  to monitor, model, and manage Earth’s natural  systems. The Planetary Computer will solve the  core data access problems for planetary scale  problems, ranging from scientific research to  enterprise-grade applications, so that developers  building applications on top of it can focus on  what makes their solutions unique. We are continuously identifying and onboarding  high-value, openly licensed datasets for broad  usage in the Planetary Computer. We are  improving our pipelines to reduce the latency  between data becoming available and being  findable and usable in users’ existing workflows. We will continue to grow our network of  partners developing impactful environmental  sustainability applications using the data and  services of the Planetary Computer. This includes  investing in partners that use technologies like AI  to push the boundaries of what is possible and  empower their users with the tools they need  to make decisions to protect the ecosystems of  our planet. Microsoft will continue to support the open- source ecosystem of tools that we use to deploy  our services and that our users rely on to process,  analyze, and operationalize the data of the  Planetary Computer. Access the open-source tools, models, infrastructure,  data, and APIs from Microsoft engineering and  data science teams to support sustainability and  environmental science. Our Reports Hub available at microsoft.com/ transparency    provides a consolidated, comprehensive  view of our ESG reporting and data ranging from our  carbon footprint to workforce demographics to political  donations. This Environmental Sustainability Report  is an important part of that overall set of disclosures. For this and other reports, we inform our disclosure  strategies with careful consideration of commonly used  global standards such as sector-based materiality maps  provided by the Sustainable Accounting Standards  Board (SASB), the United Nations Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework, and  the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We presented  greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the GHG  Protocol and select environmental metrics that reference  the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (GRI). We have  been reporting to CDP since 2010, consistently making  it to CDP Climate Change A-list and earning the highest  band of A and A- for CDP Water Security since 2016. On climate-related issues, we are committed to fully  aligning with the recommendations of the Task Force  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We work to apply the power of technology to earn  and sustain the trust of the customers and partners  we empower and the communities in which we live  and work. This focus extends to our work to build a  sustainable future where everyone has access to the  benefits and opportunities that technology can bring. It’s central to our mission to empower every person and  organization to achieve more, and it΄s why many of our  employees come to work every day. We know that the decisions we make affect our  employees, customers, partners, shareholders, suppliers,  and communities, and we take their voices into account. Microsoft receives input from millions of people each  year—from individual customers to policymakers  and global human rights specialists. We bring outside  perspectives into the company and inform our business  decisions through a variety of feedback channels. We go  beyond formal channels, proactively engaging with  key stakeholders, advocacy groups, industry experts,  corporate social responsibility (CSR) rating agencies,  CSR-focused investors, and many others. We also share  our learnings and practices thereby generating industry  dialogue, informing public debate, and advancing  greater progress. Our ESG reporting describes those topics which we  consider to be the most important to stakeholders  when evaluating environmental, social, and governance  issues at Microsoft. Therefore, ESG materiality in our  reporting does not directly correspond to the concept of  materiality used in securities law. A listing of what we currently identify and categorize as  our top ESG issues can be found on our website. In 2020,  Microsoft conducted a materiality assessment focused  on environmental sustainability, which can be accessed in  last year's report. Microsoft has made sustainability part of its business,  including embedding it deeply into its governance  structure. Our Board of Directors provides insight,  feedback, and oversight across a broad range of  environmental and social matters. In particular, the  responsibilities of the Board’s Regulatory and Public  Policy Committee include providing oversight and  guidance to the Board and management about  the company’s policies and programs that relate to  corporate social responsibility, including the company’s  environmental sustainability strategy and commitments. Microsoft’s management team understands that  sustainability performance is linked in myriad ways  to the company’s long-term financial performance  and growth that is sustainable in every sense of the  word. We are committed to building and executing on  strategies to help foster a healthy planet and advance a  more inclusive economy that fosters additional growth  opportunities for everyone.

EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment  Tool) is the leading global Type-1 ecolabel for the  technology sector, managed by the Global Electronics  Council (GEC). The program requires independent  verification of product and corporate eco-attributes  to ensure that the product meets the EPEAT criteria  as claimed. We apply EPEAT standards to our Surface  devices. Surface devices must meet specific sustainability  and lifecycle-based design and performance criteria to  achieve the baseline tier, “Bronze” EPEAT registration  level. The achievement of additional optional criteria  results in a higher registration of “Silver” or “Gold” level. We are continuously working to reach the highest  level of EPEAT registration level, “Gold”, for all our  devices. In late 2020, we achieved registration not just  in the United States but also in Canada, and in 2021  we expanded our registration to most of Europe. These ratings are used by customers to make  purchasing decisions based on product and corporate  environmental and social attributes. We track progress  against EPEAT targets across our Surface portfolio. For more information, visit the EPEAT registry which  includes a listing of all registered devices including the  countries of registration and the EPEAT tier. 3 Measurement is based on the device industry  best-practice life cycle methodology, which is not  currently reflected in Microsoft’s corporate disclosure. 5 Measurement is based on construction industry  best-practice life cycle methodology, which is not  currently reflected in Microsoft’s corporate disclosure. Updates to Microsoft’s corporate disclosure  methodologies will be published annually. 6 This statistic is based on a life cycle methodology  for emissions reporting that Microsoft has not yet  adopted in its corporate disclosure. 7 Measurement is based on the Global Logistics  Emissions Council (GLEC) methodology, which is  not currently reflected in Microsoft’s corporate  disclosure. Updates to Microsoft’s corporate disclosure  methodologies will be published annually. 9 672 million liters per year is measured using the  Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting method  with WRI and Limnotech. As part of Microsoft’s commitment to disclose  information about our environmental footprint, the  following sections are a compilation of environmental  metrics across greenhouse gas emissions, energy,  water, waste, and land. Section 1 presents greenhouse gas emissions in  accordance with the GHG Protocol and select  environmental metrics that reference the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Deloitte &  Touche LLP performed a review engagement on  management’s assertion related to the specified  information presented in Section 1 of Appendix D  as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and  includes their review report. Information relating to  periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021,  was not subject to Deloitte & Touche LLP's review  and, accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP does not  express a conclusion or any form of assurance on  such information. Section 2 presents additional environmental metrics  that show additional detail and breakdowns and was  not subject to Deloitte & Touche LLP’s review. All reported values represent best available data at the  time of publication. Data is adjusted to incorporate  updated methodology, structural changes, and/or  accuracy improvements. Additional detail on these  changes is included as footnotes where applicable.

Previous years have been updated to reflect this change. 3  As the product life cycle assessments for Microsoft devices continue to be improved, the  emissions calculations for these categories have been updated for improved accuracy. Energy use assumptions have been updated to reflect our latest understanding of device  use via telemetry. In addition, minor error corrections were made. Previous years have  been updated to reflect this change. 4  Market-based fuel- and energy-related emissions in FY17—FY20 have undergone a  change in calculation methodology to improve accounting of electricity transmission  and distribution. 5  Overall increase in Scope 3 categories 1 and 2 emissions is driven mainly by the growth  of Microsoft's cloud services business and device manufacturing. Increase in Scope 3  category 11 is driven by an increase in sales and usage of devices. 6  As of FY21, waste emissions calculations include emissions for all waste streams, except  construction and deconstruction which is currently not reported and will be part of data  improvements going forward. This change due to improved data availability has been  retrospectively applied to FY20 and FY19, but not FY18 or FY17 because comprehensive  waste data was not available in those years. 10  This data supports Microsoft's ongoing target to be carbon neutral every year from fiscal year 2013 onward. The boundary for   
this carbon neutral commitment includes global Scope 1, Scope 2 Market-based, and Scope 3 business air travel. As progress   is made towards the carbon negative commitment, which includes purchasing removal offsets, the commitment to carbon   neutrality will also be maintained. heating sold, cooling sold, and steam sold categories are currently not applicable. In gigajoules, total energy consumption   equals 48,534,706 GJ, and total fuel consumed equals 1,607,101 GJ. credits, and power purchase agreements (PPAs). Specific to PPAs, in FY21 new agreements for approximately 5.8 gigawatts   (GW) of capacity were signed, totaling more than 8 GW of renewable energy via PPAs or long-term contracts. 14     In FY18 the water data collection methodology was adjusted to include more accurate data center withdrawal estimates. FY17 withdrawal estimates were not retroactively adjusted. 50% of the change from FY17 to FY18 is from the methodology  adjustment, and the other 50% is from organizational growth. For FY21 total water withdrawal from areas with water stress  was 1,698 ML (22%) and was primarily sourced from third-party water; total water discharge to areas with water stress was  915 ML (29%); and total water consumption from areas with water stress was 783 ML (17%). Water risk assessment conducted  using WRI’s Aqueduct tool and reported values consider high or extremely high baseline water stress. 15    Brackish surface water/seawater and produced water categories are not relevant to Microsoft since there is no withdrawal  or discharge of water from and to these sources. For withdrawals, data breakdown between ‘freshwater’ and ‘other  water’ categories, and withdrawal sources is currently unavailable and will be part of data improvements going forward. For consumption, gathering data around water storage will also be part of our future data improvements. 16  Only discharges to third-parties are relevant since water that is not consumed at Microsoft sites is discharged to local municipal   
treatment plants. Discharges to surface water, groundwater, seawater and volume sent for use to other organizations are not   applicable. For discharges, data breakdown between ‘freshwater’ and ‘other water’ categories is currently unavailable and will   be part of data improvements going forward. Primary treatment of water is not relevant because there are no onsite water   treatment plants in Microsoft operations, as there is no requirement to conduct onsite primary treatment of discharge by any   environmental regulation or standard. 17  Starting in FY19, reported values encompass global data across Microsoft's direct waste footprint, including estimates where  needed, except for waste from construction and deconstruction and GitHub which is currently not reported and will be part  of data improvements going forward. Waste generation values and classifications have been updated for FY19 and FY20 to  be consistent with data collection, reporting boundary, and estimation methodology improvements established in FY21. Reported data back to FY19 was adjusted to represent waste streams only within Microsoft’s operational control boundary, and  as such, properly exclude disposition of packaging from our sold products. Data for reuse or other diversion methods besides  recycling for hazardous waste, and other disposal operations besides landfilled and incineration for non-hazardous waste is  currently not applicable and will be part of data improvements going forward if they become applicable. As waste accounting  continues to improve, reported values may change. Reported waste data is mainly directed for disposal offsite. Total size and country location of all habitat areas   selected for protection for which contributions   were  made  
A description of partnerships for which contributions   were made that exist with third parties to protect   habitat  areas   
Since making this commitment in April 2020, Microsoft   identified two leading land protection organizations,   the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)   within the United States and The Nature Conservancy   (TNC) globally, to partner with to achieve the   commitment to protect more land than we use. A   data-informed approach to identify ecosystems most   at risk was used, using TNC’s last chance ecosystem   framework and NFWF’s national landscape   conservation framework. Within each of the two partnerships the following   organizations will hold the conservation easement/ own the protected land:  
Total acres categorized by the status at the close of the   reporting period as either (i) funded or (ii) protected  17,268 acres (funded) Management of Microsoft Corporation is responsible  for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the  disclosures included in this Section 1 of Appendix D.  Management is also responsible for the collection,  quantification, and presentation of the specified  information included in Section 1 of Appendix D and  for the selection or development of the criteria, which  management believes provides an objective basis for  measuring and reporting on the specified information. Management of Microsoft Corporation asserts that the  specified information included in Section 1 of Appendix  D as of, and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 is  presented in accordance with the criteria set forth in  Section 1.10, Reporting criteria. Microsoft’s environmental sustainability data, which  includes GHG emissions, energy, waste, water, and  ecosystem metrics, reported for FY21 has been  prepared following a fiscal year basis as the reporting  period covering the timeframe of July 1, 2020 to  June 30, 2021. The Corporate External & Legal Affairs  (CELA) Sustainability team within Microsoft under the  leadership of the Vice President and Chief Environmental  Officer holds the responsibility to monitor and report  sustainability environmental data. For setting organizational boundaries and for corporate  reporting of GHG emissions, energy, waste, and  water metrics in Tables 1-9 above, Microsoft uses the  operational control approach. This includes global  wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries over  which Microsoft has management and operational  control, including Microsoft owned and leased real  estate facilities. Microsoft announced in January 2020 that they will be  carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 they will remove  from the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the  carbon the company has emitted either directly or by  our electricity consumption since being founded in 1975. This will be achieved by reducing Scope 3 emissions  (market-based) by more than half; and by reducing Scope  1 and 2 (market-based) emissions to near zero by the  middle of the decade through energy efficiency work  and reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. The baseline year is 2020, which was the year when the  announcement was made. Microsoft has a metrics recalculation policy for  historical data (including base year) to ensure  consistency whenever year-over-year structural  changes, methodological changes , or other accuracy  improvements are significant. Structural changes include  acquisitions and divestitures. Methodology changes  include changes in a calculation methodology or new  activity types. Accuracy improvements include the  correction of significant errors or cumulative small errors  that together are significant and/or updates to available  supplier reported data. Footnotes under each table will  highlight specific adjustments made. Microsoft’s GHG inventory includes five of the seven  GHGs addressed by the Kyoto Protocol—carbon  dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride  (SF6). Microsoft does not currently use or emit  perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). • Scope 1 direct GHG emissions from onsite fossil  fuel combustion (including natural gas, propane,  fuel oil, and diesel), executive air travel, ground  
• Scope 2 indirect GHG emissions from purchased  electricity, chilled water, and steam. The location- based method is based on average emission factors  for the electricity grids that provide electricity to our  datacenters, buildings, and campuses. The market- based method includes consideration of contractual  arrangements under which Microsoft procures power  from specific suppliers or sources, such as renewable  energy. In the market-based method, we also capture  the impact from direct renewable energy and the  purchase of unbundled energy attribute certificates  (EACs). Reported data for water, waste, and ecosystems support  the monitoring and tracking of our progress associated  with the commitments under each program. For carbon removal, the following Microsoft criteria  is used to select carbon removals that we contract:  Microsoft Criteria for High-Quality Carbon Dioxide  Removal. Both third-party certified and uncertified   tons are purchased in an effort to help develop the  market, and only certified tons are applied to the  carbon neutrality scope (Scope 1, Scope 2 market- based, and business air travel). For the certified portion,  the following validation and verification bodies have  provided the certification: Voluntary Carbon Standard  (VCS), American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action  Reserve (CAR), and California Air Resources Board (CARB). The reported carbon removal contracted value total also  includes future tons that have not yet been delivered. For renewable energy, the impact is captured from  on-site generation, renewable energy certificates  (RECs) and from power purchase agreements (PPAs). The purchases of RECs include: RECs (Green-e certified),  guarantees of origin (GO), renewable energy guarantees  of origin (REGO), I-RECs, tradable instrument for  global renewables (TIGR), J-Credits, large scale energy  certificates (LGC) and PowerPlus. Microsoft procures  enough renewable energy to match 100% of its electricity  consumption. In the case that renewable energy is not  procured in the markets where they operate, enough  renewable energy from nearby markets is purchased  to ensure we maintain the 100% renewable electricity  commitment is maintained. Microsoft’s water inventory includes the withdrawal,  consumption, and discharge associated with assets under  its operational control. These volumes represent global  enterprise-wide operations including offices, datacenters,  labs, and retail. This data supports progress tracking  against current Water Positive program commitments, as  well as future reporting against the newer commitment  announced in October 2021 of reducing water waste in  datacenter operations by 95 percent by 2024. Similarly, the waste inventory includes the mass of waste  generated from operations within Microsoft’s operational  control that are landfilled, incinerated, recycled, reused,  and composted for both non-hazardous and hazardous  categories. This waste inventory supports progress  tracking against the commitment of diverting 90% of  operational waste at datacenters and campuses. Reported data for ecosystems includes the total area of  land that has been funded and protected based on the  presented definition in table 1.10 for reporting criteria. Microsoft’s land protection commitment was established  in FY20 therefore reported data for FY21 represents  progress for the first year. Currently the waste inventory does not include waste  from construction and deconstruction activities. Reported operational waste does not include impact  from business group GitHub. Data across metrics  currently excludes impact from the ZeniMax acquisition  completed in March 2021. Both GitHub and ZeniMax  impacts are estimated to be under the significance  threshold and will be included in the next report. These items are part of Microsoft’s continuous data  improvement activities and will be included and  highlighted accordingly in the next reporting cycle. Primary data is used to calculate emissions for both  Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Estimates are used where  primary data is not available. Activity data is collected  internally and stored in an internally developed data  platform which then applies the corresponding emission  factors to calculate emissions. Microsoft uses the IPCC  Fourth Assessment when it comes to applying global  warming potential values. Scope 2  Electricity (US)  Year 2019 eGRID Subregion Emission Factors: eGRID 2019, February 2021. For market- based emissions the factors presented are used as needed. For regions where  residual emission factors are available we have 100% renewable energy purchases,  therefore not currently applicable.

Year 2019 factors from June 2021 release. Microsoft calculates and reports Scope 3 emissions for  all relevant categories. The following table summarizes  which categories are relevant and a description of the  methodology and emission factors used. This category includes emissions from upstream purchasing of goods and  services, including direct and indirect goods. Microsoft uses its suppliers’  CDP Supply Chain responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2, and upstream  Scope 3 emission factors (mtCO2e/$ revenue). The latest available  responses are used, so this report's inventory considers 2021 submissions  (i.e. 2020 data). Microsoft estimates emissions from CDP Supply Chain  respondents by multiplying the CDP-derived factor by the annual spend  with the supplier. All other spend is mapped to corresponding industry  sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to-gate emission factors by sector  from UK Defra’s “UK Defra, Table 13 – Indirect emissions from the supply  chain. March 2014”—updated per the latest inflation and currency  conversion rates. Corporate-wide expense data for all company divisions is  obtained from the finance department. Industry sectors already included  in Scope 1 and Scope 2 (such as electricity purchases) and other Scope 3  categories (such as capital goods) were removed to prevent double  counting. Global warming potentials (GWP) values are derived from the  underlying CDP Supply Chain-based responses and Defra data sources. Capital goods  This category includes emissions from upstream purchasing of capital  goods, including server equipment and other long-term assets. Microsoft  uses its suppliers' CDP Supply Chain responses to determine Scope 1, Scope  2, upstream Scope 3 emission factors (tCO2e/$ revenue). The latest  available responses are used, so this report’s inventory considers 2021  submissions (i.e. 2020 data). Microsoft estimates emissions from CDP  Supply Chain respondents by multiplying the CDP-derived factor by the  annual spend with the supplier. All other spend is mapped to  corresponding industry sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to-gate  emission factors by sector from UK Defra’s ""UK Defra, Table 13 – Indirect  emissions from the supply chain. March 2014""—updated per the latest  inflation and currency conversion rates. Corporate-wide expense data for  all company divisions is obtained from the finance department. Industry  sectors already included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 (such as electricity  purchases) and other Scope 3 categories were removed to prevent double  counting. GWP values are derived from the underlying CDP Supply  Chain-based responses and Defra data sources. Purchased goods  and services This category includes emissions from upstream purchasing of goods and  services, including direct and indirect goods. Microsoft uses its suppliers’  CDP Supply Chain responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2, and upstream  Scope 3 emission factors mtCO2e/$ revenue). The latest available  responses are used, so this report's inventory considers 2021 submissions  (i.e. 2020 data). Microsoft estimates emissions from CDP Supply Chain  respondents by multiplying the CDP-derived factor by the annual spend  with the supplier. All other spend is mapped to corresponding industry  sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to-gate emission factors by sector  from UK Defra’s “UK Defra, Table 13 – Indirect emissions from the supply  chain.

Global warming potentials (GWP) values are derived from the  underlying CDP Supply Chain-based responses and Defra data sources. Starting in 2019, Microsoft has been reporting this category as calculated  using the 'market-based' approach, which includes Microsoft’s  investment in renewable electricity. Fuel- and energy-related activities  (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include three emission sources. First,  upstream emissions of purchased electricity were calculated by  multiplying electricity use by emission factors from lifecycle analysis tools  for the US and UK Defra 2015 Guidelines for non-US countries. Factors for  upstream emissions resulting from global renewable electricity  generation are from lifecycle assessment tools. Second, fuel consumption  was multiplied by emission factors from the GREET and Ecoinvent  lifecycle analysis tools. And third, transmission and distribution (T&D)  losses (by energy use type) were multiplied by emission factors from the  EPA’s eGRID2019 database for the United States and from IEA (2021)  emission factors for other countries. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth  Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average. This category includes emissions from upstream transportation of goods,  including all transportation of goods that Microsoft finances. Microsoft  uses its suppliers' CDP Supply Chain responses to determine Scope 1, Scope  2, upstream Scope 3 emission factors (tCO2e/$ revenue). The latest  available responses are used, so this report’s inventory considers 2021  submissions (i.e. 2020 data). Microsoft estimates emissions from CDP  Supply Chain respondents by multiplying the CDP-derived factor by the  annual spend with the supplier. All other spend is mapped to  corresponding industry sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to-gate  emission factors by sector from UK Defra’s ""UK Defra, Table 13 – Indirect  emissions from the supply chain. March 2014""—updated per the latest  inflation and currency conversion rates. Corporate-wide expense data for  all company divisions is obtained from the finance department. Industry  sectors already included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 (such as electricity  purchases) and other Scope 3 categories were removed to prevent double  counting. GWP values are derived from the underlying CDP Supply  Chain-based responses and Defra data sources. Waste generated  in operations  The waste figure represents emissions from waste disposed via  landfilling, incineration, recycling, and compost. Emissions from waste  are calculated using methodologies and emission factors from the EPA’s  Waste Reduction Model (WARM), version 15. This model bases its  emissions calculations on a lifecycle analysis, including emissions from  the long-term decomposition of waste in a landfill or from upstream  sources/sinks. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),  100-year average. Business travel  Historically, this category has included emissions from commercial air  travel only. FY20 (reporting year) was the first year that additional  business travel emissions sources were included, including hotel night  stays, rail travel, reimbursed mileage, rental cars, and taxi/rideshares. For  commercial air and rail travel, Microsoft Corporate Travel provides flight/  ride-level airport codes and cabin class data. The airport/rail station  codes are used to calculate distances to determine whether the flights/  rides were short, medium, or long haul. Using the distance-based  method, flight distances and cabin class are used to calculate CO2e  emissions, using the appropriate emission factors from: 2020 Guidelines  to Defra/DECC's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting). For hotel night stays, Microsoft's preferred hotel vendors provided  emissions per hotel night stay coefficients. For other hotel chains,  emissions were estimated based on nights stayed and the emission  factors from the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Indirect  Emissions from Events and Conferences (Dec 2018). For rental cars,  mileage, fuel, and emission data was provided from each rental car  company. For taxi/rideshare and reimbursed mileage, emissions were  estimated based on spend using emission factors from EPA Emission  Factor Hub. March 2018. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment  Report (AR4), 100-year average. Employee commuting  This category captures emissions from commuting by all employees and  contractors that work in Microsoft buildings. Microsoft conducted a  survey in May 2019 to capture detailed commuting habits from  employees and vendors at our Puget Sound campus, representing ~36%  of global Microsoft headcount. The survey is typically conducted  annually but was not performed in 2021. The results were scaled to  estimate global commuting emissions for Microsoft. CO2 emission rates  for passenger vehicles (single occupancy vehicle [SOV] and carpool) are  based on fuel consumption and miles travelled. A weighted average fuel  economy using the 2012 EPA Fuel Economy Trends Report 1975–2012 was  derived, which provides combined fuel economy for cars and trucks by  year, and a set of car and truck age fractions provided by the Puget  Sound Regional Council. This data was used to develop a weighted  average fuel economy for the Puget Sound area. Emission factors are  derived from the Inventory of US. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks:  1990–2010, Annex 2 (Methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from  fossil fuel combustion). CO2 rates per passenger mile are based on  Federal Transit Administration, 2010 (Public Transportation’s Role in  Responding to Climate Change, US DOT, Federal Transit Administration,  January 2010). GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),  100-year average. As nearly all Microsoft employees worked from home  during the COVID-19 pandemic, FY20 was the first year to include  emission impacts from telework. Telework energy consumption is  assumed to include workstation/plug-load energy usage, additional  lighting and household cooling/heating consumption. 1 laptop,  2 monitors and 3 lightbulbs are assumed for each employee; other  assumptions include 8 work hours/day and 250 days/year using the  devices. Office/workspace floor area and cooling/heating intensity are  assumed based on EIA’s 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey  (RECS) data. From these assumptions, a carbon emission intensity per  employee is calculated, and total emissions are calculated by multiplying  the intensity by number of employees during the period of remote work. Included in this category are the emissions from transporting and  warehousing of devices Microsoft sold (including, but not limited to,  Xbox devices, Microsoft Surface devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and  other peripherals) from Microsoft manufacturing sites to retailers and  customers. Calculations are based on standard assumptions of distance  between retailers and their distribution centers and warehouse  floorspace from an MWPVL International analysis of Walmart’s  distribution center network. Assumptions about the energy intensity of  warehouses come from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s  Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (2012). Emission  factors for shipping come from the GaBi database. GWPs are from the  IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average. Processing of sold  products  Not relevant. Microsoft did not have any physical intermediate products  in the years reported. Use of sold products  Included in this category is the lifetime electricity use of devices Microsoft  sold including, but not limited to, Xbox devices, Surface devices, HoloLens,  keyboards, mice, and other peripherals. Lifetime electricity use per device is  calculated based on standard product-use assumptions as included in our  ISO 14040– and ISO 14044–compliant lifecycle analyses. This year updates  to energy use assumptions that reflect latest understanding of device use  via telemetry data are also included. Assumptions on total lifetime expected  use (years) are used. Sales geography for the products sold is used to  determine the electricity emission factor used to calculate emissions. GWPs  are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average. End of life treatment of  sold products  Included in this category is the end-of-life treatment of devices Microsoft  sold during the reporting year including, but not limited to, Xbox devices,  Surface devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals. End-of-life emissions for each product are based on modeling within our  ISO 14040– and ISO 14044–compliant lifecycle analyses. To generate an  estimate for this category, the model assumes that all devices are sent to  landfills at the end of their useful life. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth  Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average. Downstream leased  assets  Emissions associated with sublets are calculated using the intensities  derived from data collected for the primary leased space (for example,  kilowatt-hours/square foot [kWh/SF]) and prorated for the square  footage of the sublet space. In this way, it is assumed that the emissions  intensities of the leased spaces are the same as the overall buildings in  which they reside. Estimated refrigerants are calculated using the same  methodology and intensity as used to calculate refrigerant intensities for  assets occupied by Microsoft. Electricity emission factors used are those  appropriate to each location, as utilized in our Scope 1 and Scope 2  location-based inventory. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment  Report (AR4), 100-year average. Investments  Not relevant for reported years. Joint ventures, actively managed  investments, and direct equity investments totaled less than 2 percent  of Microsoft’s market capitalization at the end of the reporting period. Microsoft has not engaged in the long-term financing of projects  and the proceeds for each debt issuance have been for general  corporate purposes. Primary data is used to calculate water withdrawal,  discharge and consumption, and waste generation where  Microsoft operates. Estimates are used where primary  data is not available. Water withdrawals are based on data from utility bills  from our largest sites and, in some cases, estimations. An estimation methodology for sites where primary data  is unavailable that considers square footage, electricity  consumption, and cooling type is used. Where discharges  and consumption are not metered, amounts are estimated  annually as part of the global water inventory aggregation  process. Most of the sites do not have discharge meters. A low water consumption at many of the sites is estimated,  unless there are specific water consuming activities present. Where there is water consumption (such as for landscaping,  evaporative coolers, cooling towers, settling ponds), it is  estimated that discharge equals the difference between  withdrawals and consumption. Microsoft continues to work  on improvements for water consumption data collection. Operational waste mass is based on data from invoices  and/or vendor/third party reports. In the absence of  actual data, there is an extrapolation methodology. Depending on the type of site, the methodology  uses capacity (MW) based coefficients by region or  attendance to extrapolate waste for those locations  where primary data is unavailable.

Renewable electricity is defined as energy sources that are capable of being replenished in a short time through  ecological cycles or agricultural processes. The scope of renewable electricity includes renewable electricity the entity directly produced and renewable  electricity the entity purchased, if purchased through a renewable PPA that explicitly includes RECs or GOs, a  Green-e Energy Certified utility or supplier program, or other green power products that explicitly include RECs or  GOs, or for which Green-e Energy Certified RECs are paired with grid electricity. - For any renewable electricity generated on-site, any RECs and GOs must be retained (that is, not sold) and retired  or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim them as renewable energy. - For renewable PPAs and green power products, the agreement must explicitly include and convey that RECs  and GOs be retained or replaced and retired or cancelled on behalf of the entity in order for the entity to claim  them as renewable electricity. - The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix that is outside of the control or influence of the entity is  excluded from the scope of renewable electricity. The percentage renewable electricity is calculated as total renewable energy consumption in megawatt hours  divided by total electricity consumption (as disclosed in Disclosure 302-1(c)(i) Electricity consumption from the  GRI Standard: 302 Energy 2016). a. The total size in acres and country location of all habitat areas selected for protection for which  contributions were made. b. A description of partnerships for which contributions were made that exist with third parties  to protect habitat areas. Size of habitat areas is calculated as Microsoft’s contribution amount divided by the cost per acre of the habitat  protection project as determined by the partner organization. These amounts are net of overhead costs.

10,"Cover photo This North Carolina solar facility is one of the many energy solutions  utilized by Apple’s suppliers to support their commitments to 100 percent  renewable energy for Apple production. Developing solutions to global challenges  is never an easy journey, and it isn’t one that  can be undertaken alone. In a year like no  other, Apple has continued to work with a  global network of colleagues, companies,  and advocates to further our efforts to make  our environmental work a force for good in  people’s lives—and give the communities  most impacted by climate change a seat  at the table. As a result, this has been a year of progress powered by  collaboration. As a company, we moved ahead with greater  urgency than ever before to create a stronger, healthier  future for our planet and her people. In 2020, that meant real progress in our fight against climate  change. Apple became carbon neutral for our worldwide  operations, and we committed to becoming carbon neutral by  2030 for our entire footprint—from our supply chain to the use  of the products we make. Those same products now use more  recycled materials than ever, like the 40 percent recycled content  in the MacBook Air with Retina display, and the 99 percent  recycled tungsten we now use in iPhone 12 and Apple Watch  Series 6. There’s an old saying that if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Well this year we did both,  setting ambitious goals for Apple while helping more than 100  of our suppliers commit to joining our journey to being carbon  neutral. That progress was powered by our new renewable  energy projects spanning the globe—from an award-winning,   180-acre solar project in Reno, Nevada, to two of the  world’s largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark. While we helped bring more than 4 gigawatts of renewable  energy online, we doubled down on our efforts to remove  carbon from the atmosphere. That included an innovative new  partnership with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs  called the Restore Fund to invest in working forests, revitalizing  ecosystems with the goal of removing 1 million metric tonnes of  carbon every year. Shaping all of this work is Apple’s commitment to equity. At this  moment of rebuilding, we know we can help spur an economic  recovery that tackles systemic barriers to opportunity and  empowers local communities—especially the communities  most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. One way we’re doing this is with the Impact Accelerator we  launched last year, which invests in minority-owned businesses  on the cutting edge of green technology and clean power. The Accelerator is part of our $100 million Racial Equity and  Justice Initiative, which is advancing equitable opportunity  in our economy, our schools, and our criminal justice system. But our commitment to equity goes much further. Everything,  from our clean energy investments to our partnerships, considers  the impacts on the local community. And we continue to ask  ourselves how we can make our work an even greater force  for good. In every case, the answer is to listen, to engage, and to work  together. For one of our first solar projects in China, that  meant building solar panels high enough above the ground  for local farmers’ yaks to graze under. In Colombia, it meant  partnering with local community, government, and conservation  organizations, which help preserve mangrove forests deeply  intertwined with the economic and cultural lives of their  communities. And in Kenya, it meant bolstering the pioneering  work of conservationists supporting sustainable tree farming  and preserving savannas degraded by unsustainable land- use practices. These projects are definitive proof that the fight against climate  change is also a fight for local economies, for the rights of  indigenous peoples, and for the communities whose lives  and livelihoods are most threatened by climate change. These are systemic and long-standing issues, and we don’t  pretend to have all the answers. What we do have are goals to  strive for, and a global community of businesses committed to  doing the right thing by people and the planet. Thank you for  your role in our progress to push this urgent work forward. We aim to make products  and packaging using only  recycled or renewable  materials. At the same  time, we’re committed  to stewarding water  resources and sending  zero waste to landfill. Science drives our environmental strategy. Our ambitions—including our commitment to carbon neutrality  by 2030—are defined by data. And so are the three pillars of our strategy: climate change, resources, and  smarter chemistry. Our comprehensive carbon footprint informs the work we do to address our climate  impact, including our roadmap to carbon neutrality. Within our resources pillar, data on environmental,  social, and supply impacts prioritize materials we transition to recycled and renewable sources. And a  detailed process of data collection and chemical assessments drives our smarter chemistry innovations. All the work we do aims to improve environmental health, not just for our customers, suppliers, and  employees, but also for broader global communities. Climate Change    We’ve set a goal to  become carbon neutral  across our entire  footprint by 2030. We will get there by  reducing our emissions  by 75 percent compared  to 2015, and then  investing in carbon  removal solutions for  the remaining emissions. Through chemistry  innovation and rigorous  controls, we design our  products to be safe for  anyone who assembles,  uses, or recycles them— and to be better for the  environment. We remain committed to our mission of creating products that  enrich the lives of our customers. And we’re equally committed to  doing so in a manner that doesn’t deplete the earth’s resources. This commitment acknowledges our responsibility for our entire  value chain—which extends across our facilities and through  the entire life cycle of our products. And it drives our strategy— whether innovating solutions to environmental challenges  or creating opportunities for minority-owned businesses and  institutions that have been historically disadvantaged. We’re  striving to enable the type of world we want to live in. That means  taking steps to help others reduce their footprint, as well as  protect communities that often disproportionately bear the costs  of environmental harm. Only by engaging with others can we meet our ambitious  goals and realize the changes our world needs. We learn  from the expertise of others, including our Green Chemistry  Advisory Board. We seek out those who inspire us, like the  Malala Fund, which we support in their work at the intersection  of climate change and education. We collaborate to advance  our environmental initiatives, like our work with the Platform for  Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) to promote circular  supply chains. And, by sharing our strategy and approach, we  aim to maximize the impact of our efforts while empowering  others. When our CEO Tim Cook addressed the United Nations’  Climate Ambition Summit, he resoundingly reinforced our  commitment to transition to a carbon neutral economy and  create inclusive opportunities. “ This is no time for   changes at the margins. Together, we can   transition to a carbon   neutral economy and   usher in a new era of   inclusive opportunity. This is a moment for   ambition, cooperation,   and leadership.”    Tim Cook, CEO  United Nations’ Climate Ambition Summit  December, 2020 At Apple, we’re committed to utilizing our resources as an organization to combat climate change. Our  commitment to carbon neutrality by 2030 is both ambitious and necessary. These efforts require innovations  at scale—like designing and implementing new technologies, mobilizing financing structures, and rapidly  deploying renewable energy. Everything we do is driven by science and the urgency to tackle climate change. Achieve carbon neutrality for   our entire carbon footprint by   2030, and reach our science-based  emissions reduction target Climate change is one of the greatest threats  of our time, putting at risk people’s access to  clean air, adequate food, safe drinking water,  and sanitation. This means the impact of the changes we make—improving  energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy across  our supply chain—extends beyond our factories, stores, and  offices to benefit those who live in the communities where we  operate. The future success of our company depends on taking  urgent and decisive action. For years, we have increased energy  efficiency and the use of renewable energy, yet we know we have  to do more. That’s why last year, we unveiled our most ambitious  plan to date: to achieve carbon neutrality for the entire life cycle  of our products by 2030. This goal places us 20 years ahead of  the recommendations put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (the United Nations body for assessing the  science related to climate change) calling for carbon neutrality  as a planet by 2050. The science is clear: Our world cannot wait  for an inclusive, carbon neutral economy. Every business has a  responsibility to create a meaningful plan to reduce its emissions. Our goal and approach are informed by science. We focus on  avoiding activities that generate carbon in the first place. And,  wherever possible, we’re switching to lower-carbon alternatives. In cases where emissions can’t be avoided, we’ll then remove  the equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere. While  we pursue viable solutions, we also align to the same carbon  mitigation hierarchy in our strategy. It isn’t the easiest approach,  but it’s the one science shows is necessary to address  climate change. • Taking a comprehensive approach: Our responsibility  extends beyond our direct operations to the entire life cycle  of our products. We calculate emissions from the production  of raw materials, product manufacturing, shipping, the energy  used to power our facilities and our customers’ devices, as well  as material recycling and recovery. Our commitment to reach  neutrality for our full product life cycle shapes the actions we  pursue. We can effect direct change through product design  and using low-carbon inputs. Through supplier engagement,  we can work with our manufacturing partners to transition  to 100 percent renewable energy. And through the power  of policy and industry collaboration, we can unlock climate  solutions on a global scale. • Set ambitious targets: Our plan to reach neutrality by  2030 centers around our strategy to reduce emissions by  75 percent, relative to our 2015 footprint. This reduction  aligns with what current climate science shows is necessary  to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. We’ll invest in high-quality  carbon removal projects to address the emissions that  remain, prioritizing the protection of ecosystems as a  powerful, natural carbon solution. These projects will also  align to rigorous international standards to ensure their impact. And by avoiding emissions first, we’ll also reduce the carbon  we need to remove. • Match solutions to sources: For each activity within our  value chain, we will choose decarbonization actions that tie  to the source of those emissions. We’ll address emissions  from electricity with renewable energy and emissions from  transportation with alternative fuels. By matching solutions  to carbon sources, we will do our part to decarbonize  the economy. Our Green Bond engages  investors in our work  toward carbon neutrality. In our 2020 Green Bond  report, we disclose  progress on the projects  funded over the last year  that bring us closer to our  2030 goal. Read our 2020 Green  Bond report (PDF). • Align business operations with environmental progress:  We believe what is good for the environment is also good  business practice. We’ve demonstrated that meeting our  environmental goals doesn’t have to come at the expense  of our bottom line. Our use of low-carbon aluminum reduces  our environmental footprint while maintaining our design  standards. We’ve also established investment funds for  clean energy and nature-based solutions, designed to  deliver both environmental benefits and financial returns. And we are leveraging the funds from Apple’s €2 billion  (approximately US$2.2 billion) bond issuance in 2019  to help meet our climate goal, while providing a return  to investors. • Explore all solutions: Climate change is a complex  problem that demands that global actors use multiple  tools to address it. That’s why our ambitious roadmap  includes a portfolio of solutions across a 10-year time frame. We have to scale proven solutions now, while also exploring  the solutions of the future. This includes the development  of new technologies, like our support for direct carbon-free  aluminum smelting. • Be open: We are committed to disclosing our climate  strategy and progress, as well as climate risk–related  financial information. By sharing our approach, we aim to  send clear signals to our partners and invite them to work  with us. We also hope to empower our peers in their pursuit  of carbon neutrality and engage investors in our pursuit  of carbon neutrality through green bonds. Our reports, as  well as our response to the global disclosure nonprofit CDP,  will provide details on our progress. Low-carbon design  We will design products and manufacturing processes  to be less carbon-intensive through thoughtful material  selection, increased material efficiency, and greater  product energy efficiency. Renewable electricity  We will maintain our use of 100 percent renewable  electricity for our own facilities and transition our entire  supply chain to 100 percent clean, renewable sources  of electricity. Carbon removal  Working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts,  we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects,  including nature-based solutions that protect and  restore ecosystems around the world. Energy efficiency  We will increase energy efficiency at our own facilities  and in our supply chain by finding opportunities, such  as retrofitting, to reduce energy use. Direct emissions abatement  We will avoid direct greenhouse gas emissions in our  own facilities and in our supply chain through process  innovation, emissions abatement, and the use of  non-fossil-based low-carbon fuels. Scope 1 emissions are those greenhouse  gases resulting from fuel combustion from  sources we own or operate—like vehicles   or natural gas for heating. Scope 2 emissions refer to those resulting  from the use of electricity. Renewable energy  generates minimal Scope 2 emissions, whereas  burning coal, oil, or natural gas to produce  electricity releases carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Scope 3 emissions refer to all other   indirect emissions that occur in a company’s  value chain, including upstream and  downstream activities. To achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030, we must first  understand our carbon footprint today. So we meticulously  model emissions from our entire value chain, including both our  corporate operations and our full product life cycle. That includes  emissions from manufacturing, transporting, using, and even  recycling our devices. This data defines our strategy to reduce  emissions by 75 percent and reach neutrality across our product  life cycle. Our plan to become carbon  neutral by 2030 centers  around a 75 percent  emissions reduction relative  to our 2015 footprint. We  plan to address residual  emissions through carbon  removals. Already we’ve  reduced our carbon footprint  by 40 percent since 2015. Note: We include a range  for recently estimated  emissions to reflect the  potential variances inherent  to modeling product-related  carbon emissions. Each year,  we refine our methodology  to ensure the accuracy of  our estimates. Projected  emissions are displayed with  a straight-line trajectory  toward a reduction of 75  percent by 2030. Projected  carbon removal is displayed  with a similar straight-line  growth to reach net zero  carbon emissions by 2030. Our footprint has decreased by 40 percent, marking steady  progress toward our 2030 target. And we avoided more than  15 million metric tons of emissions through initiatives to use  low-carbon materials, drive energy efficiency, and switch to  clean energy—carbon reduction efforts that separated a rise  in sales from increases in our carbon footprint. Our historical  emissions challenge the idea that good business requires  growth in carbon emissions, and we aim to show this even  more clearly going forward. We calculate our comprehensive carbon footprint using a life  cycle–based approach. Apple-specific data drives many of our  most critical calculations; in cases where that data isn’t available  we rely on secondary sources, including industry averages. We  continually refine our model to include new sources of product  life cycle data—and offer a more accurate and transparent  assessment of our footprint. Our comprehensive carbon footprint  and our methodology are verified by a third party each year to  ensure accuracy and transparency (see Appendix C). Improving  the accuracy of our carbon footprint is an ongoing process  we work on continually—as we learn more, we will revise our  roadmap to incorporate new information. And, as our data  improves, we will continually refine our emissions from previous  years and our projections. We’re focused on the road ahead, demonstrated by our  pursuit of carbon neutrality by 2030. This goal sets us ahead  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  recommendations by 20 years—because we believe our planet  and our most vulnerable communities can’t wait. We aim to  reach neutrality by reducing emissions by 75 percent relative to  our 2015 baseline, while addressing residual emissions through  carbon removals.1 
Our journey to address our corporate emissions signals our plan  to reach carbon neutrality for our full supply chain. Since 2011,  our scopes 1 and 2 emissions have declined by 73 percent,  and we had zero scope 2 electricity-related emissions for the  second year in a row. Even as our business grew, our work to drive  energy efficiency and transition to renewable energy reduced  our footprint—avoiding over 4.6 million metric tons of emissions,  the equivalent of taking almost 1 million cars off the road for a  year.2 We’ve addressed our remaining scope 1 emissions through  nature-based solutions, achieving carbon neutrality for our  corporate footprint. We’re looking to the future by conducting a climate scenario  analysis that helps us better understand the potential physical  and transition effects of climate change. To align with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range  of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2° Celsius. And we assessed geographies around the world to capture  both corporate and supplier activities. The analysis highlighted  how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals  could contribute to our corporate resiliency. It also provided  environmental data that we’ll consider in our strategies to  maintain supply chain diversification, as well as promote the  security of global assets. By switching to recycled   and hydro-smelted  aluminum, our carbon  emissions associated  with aluminum have  decreased by 72 percent  since 2015. Switching to the Apple   M1 chip for Mac mini  reduced the energy  needed to use the device  and drove down the  product’s carbon footprint  by 34 percent. We believe that well-designed products  have a lower environmental footprint. This is  a principle we strive to bring to everything we  create, and a central pillar of our 2030 goal  to achieve carbon neutrality for our entire  product life cycle. Each year, we aim to reduce the carbon emissions that result  from manufacturing and the use of our devices, without  compromising performance. Our carbon footprint helps us identify opportunities to reduce the  carbon intensity of our product designs. We work to transition to  materials from recycled sources or those made using low-carbon  energy. We prioritize the materials and components that account  for significant portions of our carbon emissions, so that the  choices we make product-by-product can scale toward reducing  our overall footprint. Less means more when it comes to our approach with materials. As we reduce the amount of materials used to make our products,  we see greater progress toward our goal of carbon neutrality. This helps us reduce the transportation and energy-intensive  processing these materials require as well as limit the amount  of scrap generated along the way. We continue to investigate  new ways to manufacture more efficiently, limiting the amount  of waste created in the process. In 2020, we’ve made clear gains with our work on integrated  circuits and boards and flexes—components we’ve prioritized  because they are carbon-intensive. Integrated circuits perform  vital functions in electronic devices, yet require significant energy  to manufacture. With the Apple M1 chip, we’ve created a more  efficiently designed chip tailored to the needs of Mac devices. This efficiency gain also brings with it environmental benefits. For example, switching to the Apple M1 chip for Mac mini reduced  the energy needed to use the device and drove down the  product’s overall carbon footprint by 34 percent.4 
We’re also driving efficiencies in the design of boards and flexes,  which account for significant carbon emissions. We’ve launched  a strategic initiative to optimize our designs to find alternatives to  these components and reduce their contributions to our footprint. For example, with iPad (8th generation) we switched from using  flexes to lower-carbon alternatives in certain applications—one  of many changes that helped reduce the total carbon footprint of  the product by 7 percent compared to the previous generation. We’re also focusing on the accessories we ship with each  product. In 2020, iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 6 devices  shipped without power adapters in the box. The change allowed  for smaller, lighter packaging. It also allowed us to fit up to  70 percent more products on a shipping pallet—which, in turn,  helps reduce emissions associated with shipping. This change  also eliminated the need for significant quantities of plastic  and zinc since power adapters comprise our largest usage  of these materials. Another design consideration is our choice of materials. By transitioning to materials that lend themselves more readily  to low-carbon processing and recycling, we can reduce our  carbon footprint. As these materials account for more significant  proportions of the materials we use, we move closer to our goal  of carbon neutrality for our products. We’ve seen clear progress with aluminum—a material where  we’ve had success in shifting to recycled materials and those  generated from low-carbon processes. Several of our products  use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures— including our latest MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the latest iPad  devices. And all enclosures made with virgin aluminum for  products released in 2020 were smelted using hydroelectricity  rather than fossil fuels—for a lower carbon impact. As a result of  these changes, our carbon emissions associated with aluminum  have decreased by 72 percent since 2015. We’re also making progress in how we source recycled aluminum. The material we derive from our manufacturing scrap provides  high-quality aluminum with fewer associated carbon emissions  than newly mined materials. And, for the first time, we’re  expanding our sourcing to include post-consumer recycled  aluminum from building and construction scrap that meets  the high standards our products require. iPad (8th generation) consumes  66 percent less energy than   the requirement for ENERGY  STAR, thanks in part to a more   energy-efficient power adapter.9  
Designing energy-efficient products even as we continually  enhance performance represents another essential pillar of our  approach to carbon neutrality. Product energy use accounts  for 19 percent of our carbon footprint—and has an impact  on the individual energy use of each of our customers. This  is why we’ve set aggressive targets to reduce our products’  energy usage. We approach this challenge in the earliest  phases of design, taking a holistic view of each product from  how efficiently software operates to the power requirements of  individual components. While this is a continual effort with each new generation of  products, we’ve already made progress. The transition to  Apple silicon on Mac devices, for example, is driving efficiency  improvements—the Mac mini consumes up to 60 percent  less energy while in active use than the previous generation.5  Through our efforts to improve energy efficiency, the average  product energy use across all major product lines has  declined by more than 70 percent since 2008.6 And Apple  products are consistently ranked by ENERGY STAR, which  sets specifications that typically reflect the 25 percent most  energy-efficient devices on the market. The group recognized  Pro Display XDR on the ENERGY STAR Most Efficient List for  2020 and 2021. In fiscal year 2020, 100 percent of our eligible  products received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy  efficiency.7 And 100 percent of our eligible products earned  the highest award from EPEAT, another environmental rating  system for electronic products that considers energy efficiency  a highlighted feature.8 Suppliers in our Supplier  Energy Efficiency  program avoided more  than 900,000 annualized  metric tons of supply chain  carbon emissions. Our energy efficiency goals extend well  beyond our products. We’re focused on using  less energy across our operations, beginning  with how we design, operate, and maintain our  facilities. And we continue these same efforts  into our supply chain, which benefits those  living in areas where our suppliers operate. Drawing less energy from electrical grids—many of which still  rely heavily on fossil fuels—helps reduce local air pollution and  improve air quality for nearby communities. Reducing energy use is an essential business process. We track  and monitor energy use across our operations and supply chain,  conducting audits to find opportunities to work more efficiently. And we view our energy use holistically, from the point of design  to the point of manufacture. Finding ways to avoid using energy in the first place is the central  focus of our energy efficiency program. We work with design  teams to tailor our building systems selection process to our  occupants’ and lab users’ specific needs. This helps ensure  our facilities are utilized efficiently and productively. We focus  on natural gas and electricity usage at each site—our offices,  data centers, R&D facilities, and retail stores—auditing how we  perform and, when needed, using best practices for energy  management to reduce our loads. Measurement is critical to this. We continue to develop our  system of energy tracking and benchmarking. This helps us  identify performance issues at our sites early. We can then take  corrective action to restore building system efficiencies and  actively manage our energy footprint. We’re also working to find energy savings through different  approaches—from renovating and retrofitting more than 100  older locations to collaborating with our local utilities to ensure  that we deploy the best available energy efficiency strategies. As we renovate sites, we review all aspects of the building for  efficiency opportunities—from lighting and electrical systems  to heating and cooling systems. For example, in Santa Clara  Valley, we worked directly with PG&E and Silicon Valley Power to  optimize how we run select facilities, so that we draw less energy  from the grid. Energy efficiency principles are incorporated early in the design  of new facilities. We look at each location’s conditions, designing  and building to local temperature, humidity, and light. As each site  becomes operational, we monitor how well we’re performing and  make needed adjustments. And we opened new retail locations  in 2020 based on our energy-efficient retail facilities prototype. We can see the results of these efforts. Our data centers, for  example, perform about 60 percent better than the ASHRAE  90.4 baseline specific to data centers.12 And design optimizations  at our Flagship Stores locations are expected to contribute up  to about 40 percent energy savings, compared to the ASHRAE  benchmark. In fiscal year 2020, our energy efficiency program  helped us reduce our usage by an additional 13.9 million   kilowatt-hours and 199,700 therms per year through adjustments  made to 7.1 million square feet of new and existing buildings.13  Together, these new initiatives reduce total energy use by   five percent in targeted buildings and will avoid about  4,900 metric tons of CO2e per year. The most significant opportunity to make an impact on energy  efficiency is with our suppliers. Currently, manufacturing accounts  for approximately 70 percent of Apple’s comprehensive carbon  footprint. Energy usage drives those emissions, so with our  suppliers, we prioritize optimizing energy use and then shifting  to renewable energy sources. Our Supplier Energy Efficiency program works side-by-side  with our Supplier Clean Energy program in supporting suppliers  to reduce emissions. By helping a supplier reduce the energy  they use, we lower the amount of renewable energy they will  need to meet their clean energy commitments. While not all  suppliers have the same level of access to renewables, each has  the opportunity to work more efficiently with the energy they’re  using. We began addressing energy efficiency with the suppliers  who expressed interest in optimizing their energy use and with  manufacturers with significant energy usage. Now we’re focusing on scaling the program content and services  to the broader supply chain, as part of our strategic effort to  reduce the energy required to make our products. From the  collaborative actions we’ve taken with our suppliers to accelerate  toward carbon neutrality, more than 900,000 annualized metric  tons of supply chain carbon emissions were avoided,   a 44 percent improvement over 2019.14 As suppliers join our energy efficiency program, we encourage  them to deeply understand their greenhouse gas emissions. As of  2019, we required our suppliers to report both their emissions and  their reduction targets.15 
To help suppliers reduce their energy use, we provide guidance  designed to help them uncover opportunities for energy  efficiency. We also assist them with assessments and technical  issues where appropriate. Typical projects may include replacing  outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems;  repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat. We’ve also provided support through workshops and trainings,  including multiday classroom trainings for employees complete  with a capstone project. We continue to expand the support  we provide to suppliers as they build more energy-efficient  systems, through new training materials and increased access  to funding opportunities. We’re focused on the impact of some of our most popular  products. One example is our three-year initiative to improve  the efficiency of iPhone manufacturing. Collectively, the six  participating supplier facilities achieved their goal of 20 percent  reductions by the end of 2020 compared to the established  2017 baseline. In addition, final assembly sites for AirPods, iPad,  and Apple Watch have all launched multiyear energy reduction  initiatives in 2020. To ensure that our work to protect the planet also helps advance  equality, Apple has launched an Impact Accelerator for Black- and  Brown-owned businesses.16 The Accelerator expands access  to opportunity by ensuring that our investments in sectors like  renewable energy, carbon removal, and recycling innovation  also help fight systemic barriers impacting communities that are  disproportionately affected by environmental issues like climate  change. With customized training, access to Apple experts,  and an expanding alumni community, our Impact Accelerator is  tailored to support companies as they achieve their next stage  of development. The Impact Accelerator is just one of many efforts within Apple’s  $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, which focuses on  efforts that address education, economic equality, and criminal  justice reform in the United States. With our partners in these  efforts, we aim to redefine business as usual and drive progress  toward a more equitable future. To apply to our Impact Accelerator program, or to learn   more about our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, visit   www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative. Supplier engagement Apple connects suppliers  interested in energy savings to  service providers specializing  in energy management and  project capital investment. Service identification  Investor and supplier work  together directly to identify  energy-saving opportunities   at the supplier site and confirm  which ones they would like   to pursue. Energy efficiency updates Investor provides energy  efficiency as a service by  making any needed process   or equipment updates to  create energy savings. Energy savings and  investment return As the supplier manufactures  products for Apple and others,  the supplier experiences a cost  savings from reduced energy  use and shares that savings  with the investor. Last year, one of our manufacturers in  Guangzhou, China, deployed a state-of- the-art energy management system. With  the system in place, the manufacturer can  monitor and optimize their complex network  of air conditioners, fans, pumps, and air  compressors at the facility. The new system allowed the facility managers to find efficiencies  in energy usage across their site, even as the facility carried  out highly engineered and specified manufacturing processes  for Apple. The facility team also installed a waste heat recovery  system that captured the heat generated by energy-intensive  equipment—like air compressors—and converted it to warm  water for use in living areas. These upgrades improved the energy  efficiency at the manufacturer’s site and helped to reduce the  facility’s carbon impact. Energy efficiency upgrades like these require a combination of  innovative technical solutions and organizational priorities that  support these goals. But, there’s another important element:  capital investment. The project at the Guangzhou manufacturing  site was made possible by capital from Asia Green Fund, as part  of a US$100 million investment initiative. This initiative brings together Asia Green Fund’s investors and  energy management contractors to offer energy efficiency as  a service to participating suppliers for the first time. This fund  makes energy-saving opportunities accessible to suppliers—  the upfront investment challenges and implementation risks will  be taken by the investors. As our suppliers realize savings from  energy costs, investors recoup their capital. Apple doesn’t directly invest capital or draw financial returns  through this initiative, but connects suppliers to Asia Green  Fund that offers both financing and energy efficiency expertise  to support complex capital intensive projects. A key barrier to  achieving energy efficiency at scale is access to capital funding. “Energy efficiency as a service” through the fund presents an  alternative approach to solve this challenge. The fund draws  on Apple’s relationships and deep knowledge of our suppliers’  facilities and engineering processes, resulting in supplier projects  that improve energy efficiency and positive environmental impact. These benefits carry over to the other technology products our  suppliers create as well, reducing both our footprint and those  of our industry. To date, US$7.5 million of investments have been  made in supplier efficiency projects using this model, bringing us  closer to our goal of carbon neutrality. We’re at a pivotal moment in addressing  climate change. Renewable energy is  poised to replace fossil fuels as the future  of electricity. Its adoption means healthier air,  stronger local economies, and lower carbon  emissions. All at cost-competitive rates. Our commitment to transition to 100 percent renewable energy for  our entire supply chain enables resiliency in the face of challenges  like climate change, and moves us closer to becoming carbon  neutral by 2030. In 2018, we announced our own operations were fully transitioned  to 100 percent renewable electricity. And we continue to expand on  our commitment to green technologies by bringing new renewable  electricity projects online around the world. In the long term, these  projects provide more cost-effective energy with less price volatility. Renewable electricity can offer a clear competitive advantage by  providing power to our operations, as well as those of our suppliers,  with greater control over energy supply and little exposure to cost  fluctuations. And by adopting green technologies, we and our  suppliers are in a unique position to drive environmental action  and support our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. Our approach is twofold. We find ways to consume energy more  efficiently, and we seek out opportunities to transition to renewable  sources that support our goal of 100 percent renewable energy  across our operations and supply chain. With the renewable energy we source, we aim to achieve the  greatest impact possible. Before we engage in an energy project,  we evaluate it with a holistic view of its potential environmental and  social impact. Whenever possible, we create new renewable energy,  going above and beyond what might be available on the local grid. We also follow stringent accountability standards to verify our clean  energy projects. Our retail stores, data centers, and offices around the world  currently source 100 percent renewable energy. We are proud of  this accomplishment—and as we grow, we’re working diligently  to maintain this benchmark. Where possible, we focus on creating  new renewables. New renewables require investment—whether  in the form of direct ownership of renewable energy projects,  equity investments, or long-term power purchase agreements. Our projects in 2020 included more than 180 megawatts of  solar power near Fredricksburg, Virginia, and outside of Reno,  Nevada, as well as 130 megawatts of wind power near Chicago,  and in Viborg, Denmark. In total, Apple-created renewable  sources account for 90 percent of the renewable electricity our  facilities use—around 1.5 gigawatts currently in use and another  30 megawatts under contract. Direct ownership (10 percent of Apple-created projects) We build our own projects, including solar, biogas fuel cells,  and low-impact hydro projects, where feasible, to provide  renewable electricity. Equity investment (3 percent of Apple-created projects)  We invest capital in new solar PV or wind projects in some markets,  matching the renewable generation with our energy use. Long-term renewable energy contracts  (87 percent of Apple-created projects) We sign long-term contracts for renewable electricity when  needed. Through power purchase agreements, virtual  power purchase agreements, and other forms of long-term  commitments, we help support new, local, and primarily solar  PV and wind projects that are in line with our renewable energy– sourcing standards. To cover any gaps in our renewable energy needs beyond  what’s provided by Apple-created projects, we directly purchase  renewable energy—about 5 percent of our total corporate  load—through available utility green energy programs. Colocation  facility vendors also supply about 3 percent of our total load of  renewable energy. And in certain situations, we go to the market  for renewable energy credits (RECs)—for example, when we  need to bridge before a renewable project comes online or  when there’s a lack of availability. These RECs, which account  for about 1 percent of our total load, must be tied to recently  constructed projects, Green-e Energy certified, where available,  and share the same power grid as the Apple facility they support. These purchases are subject to the same standards as our  Apple-created renewables. Appendix C provides additional  details on Apple’s renewable energy solutions. Achieving 100 percent renewable energy at Apple facilities  provided us a starting point to make an even greater impact. We’ve focused our efforts to source renewables around several  key pillars: undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to  local communities, working on storage solutions that facilitate  the use of renewable electricity, and supporting renewable  energy innovations. Supporting social impact Power for Impact, the program we launched in 2019, continues  to provide local communities with needed energy resources. Following our initial projects—solar developments in communities  in the Philippines and Thailand facing energy cost and availability  challenges—we supported solar power in Diepsloot, a densely  populated township in Johannesburg, South Africa, home to an  estimated 180,000 families. A portion of these families lack many  essential services including potable water, waste management,  and electricity. This system combines 152 kilowatts of PV and  830 kilowatt hours of storage across 230 solar towers and will  provide electricity to more than 3600 households. Developing energy storage Wind and solar power provide the most cost-effective new  source of electricity to many parts of the world. Yet, the  intermittent nature of these technologies has presented an  obstacle to widespread adoption—and resulted in continued  reliance on fossil fuel–powered grids. One solution to  intermittency is energy storage, which can retain generated  power until it is needed. We’ve invested in utility scale storage in  California and in research into new energy storage technologies,  even as we continue to build upon our distributed storage  capabilities in Santa Clara Valley and optimize storage at our  Apple Park microgrid. Apple is sponsoring the construction of one of the largest battery  projects in the country—an industry-leading grid-scale energy  storage project in California capable of storing 240 megawatt- hours of electricity. This project supports our 130-megawatt  California Flats solar farm that provides all of our renewable  energy in California, by storing excess energy generated during  the day and deploying it when it is most valuable. We’re also continuing to support biological methanation research  at Aarhus University, Denmark, which explores the production  of synthetic methane for storage in the existing gas grid. In  this process, bacteria consumes both hydrogen produced  from excess renewable energy and captured carbon dioxide  to produce methane, the principal component of natural gas. Methane produced from renewables is a versatile energy carrier  that can be used as a fuel source in households, industry,  and transportation. Below: In total, Apple- created renewable sources  account for 90 percent of  the renewable electricity our  facilities use, and include  wind projects in Viborg,  Denmark, and Prineville,  Oregon (pictured below). Some innovations are market-based. Outside of Fredricksburg,  Virginia, we’ve helped to realize a renewable energy aggregation  project, which brings together multiple buyers in a single energy  transaction. For this 165-megawatt project, we worked with our  partners Akamai, Swiss Re, and Etsy to help attain economies of  scale through our collective purchasing power. Advancing renewable energy through innovations In 2020, we’ve pursued innovations in how we create and  consume renewable energy. We announced our investment in  the world’s largest onshore wind turbines. The Denmark-based  project, near the town Esbjerg, features two 200-meter-tall  turbines that are expected to produce 62 gigawatt-hours each  year—enough to power almost 20,000 homes. The power  produced onsite will support Apple’s data center in Viborg, with all  surplus energy going into the Danish grid. The project will also act  as a test site for powerful offshore wind turbines. Our agreement  to purchase the electricity at an established price has helped  make this effort financially viable as it comes online.

More than   4 gigawatts of  renewable energy  brought online, and  nearly 8 gigawatts  of renewable energy  commitments reached 
Electricity usage in our supply chain is the single greatest  contributor to our carbon emissions. While this is a global issue,  the impact is also local. Bringing renewable energy online with  our suppliers and, where possible, displacing fossil fuels helps  decarbonize power grids and improves local air quality for  communities. That’s why our efforts to enable our suppliers to  reduce energy use and transition to renewables are essential  to reaching our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality. This work  presents challenges: technical and regulatory barriers, capital  requirements, and lack of awareness on where to find and access  high-quality and cost-effective solutions. Two initiatives drive our approach: our Supplier Energy Efficiency  Program and our Supplier Clean Energy Program. These work  hand in hand to reduce the energy used in our supply chain  and transition the remaining energy to renewables. We take  responsibility for our supply chain as part of our comprehensive  carbon footprint. But we also know that we can achieve even  more significant climate impact by providing a model for other  companies to follow with their suppliers, helping to reduce  emissions beyond our industry. We’ve made tremendous progress toward our goal of  transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to 100 percent  renewable electricity by 2030. One important benchmark we’ve  achieved is our initial goal, set in 2015, of bringing online over  4 gigawatts of additional renewable energy to our supply chain— with additional supplier commitments bringing the total to nearly  8 gigawatts. The renewable energy already online generated  11.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy in fiscal year 2020,  avoiding 8.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions in our supply  chain. As of March 2021, 109 manufacturing partners in 24  different countries have committed to 100 percent renewable  energy for Apple production (see Appendix B). And to cover  emissions even further upstream, Apple has invested directly in  nearly 500 megawatts of renewable energy projects. While we celebrate our transition to 100 percent renewable  energy at our facilities,17 we want to see a world in which  renewable energy is widely available and broadly used. Starting  with our suppliers, we aim to accelerate this change as we  support their transition to renewables. Our own experience gives  us knowledge we can share. And we help break down barriers,  through innovative funding structures and by advocating for clean  energy–friendly policies. In 2020, we received the RE100 award  for “best green catalyst” due to our work engaging our suppliers  on renewable energy. Expanding renewable energy opportunities The transition to renewables means helping our suppliers find  energy solutions and make the right investments to address their  specific needs. When we face barriers to accessing cost-effective  clean energy, we innovate. That’s why we developed the China  Clean Energy Fund. The fund enables Apple and our suppliers  to invest in clean energy—to date, these projects account for  134 megawatts in renewable power. We’ve also invested in  renewable energy solutions to cover upstream emissions in  our supply chain—playing a pivotal role in developing nearly  500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan. Galvanizing internal champions  Apple employees are passionate about the environment and  excited about our 2030 commitment. We’re empowering  supplier-facing employees with the tools they need to support  our mission and speed a supplier’s transition to renewable energy. It starts with data and transparency. We track the progress of  our suppliers, including those just beginning to learn about  renewables and others that are well on their way to 100 percent  renewable. We’ve also created internal trainings and crafted a  simple engagement process, backed by resources for both Apple  employees and our suppliers. By connecting our suppliers with  resources and helping them assess their performance, our teams  are scaling impact across our supply chain. Supporting supplier capacity We share the experience gained through our own transition to  100 percent renewable energy with our suppliers. We introduce  suppliers to resources and training materials with country-specific  information to guide them in their transition to renewables. These  tools are available through our Supplier Clean Energy Portal. We also educate suppliers through advanced and customized  training with leading experts. And we support the creation and  growth of renewable energy industry associations that our  suppliers can join to learn about local opportunities. Long-standing energy structures can make it difficult to bring  new renewable energy online in some regions, prompting  some of our suppliers to maximize existing renewable energy  solutions—like onsite solar installations. Others have pioneered  new purchasing methods, creating renewable energy businesses  or even participating in some of the world’s largest and most  innovative renewable energy deals. Advocating for policy change Government policies and rules can present some of the largest  barriers to transitioning to renewables. We lend our voice and  stand with other companies and NGOs to break down policy  barriers to achieve thriving clean energy markets with, for  example, enhanced grid resiliency and greater energy innovation. Across regions, we engage with policymakers to support  renewable energy that is cost-effective, accessible to companies,  and sourced from high-quality projects with a material impact on  local markets. For more information, jump to the section on our  climate policy engagements. In April 2019, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) adopted the  Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule,   which effectively repealed and replaced   the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Apple had previously voiced our support for the CPP because  it played an important role in allowing developers, utilities, and  financiers to invest in renewable energy with confidence, and  it incentivized utilities to provide corporate energy buyers like  Apple with increasing supplies of renewable energy. The adoption  of the ACE Rule eliminated those incentives. Apple spoke out  on this issue, as we believed that the ACE Rule would reduce  access to renewable energy sources and drive up the cost of  renewable energy. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  held that the ACE Rule and its repeal of the Clean Power Plan  was inconsistent with the U.S. Clean Air Act. We anticipate new  challenges ahead, but our position on strong climate policy is clear:  Each one of us has a role to play in addressing the climate crisis. We undertake our advocacy—whether in pushing for more robust  policies or fighting to protect those already in place—because  it makes business sense for Apple and it is what our customers,  shareholders, and stakeholders expect of us. Our collective action  on climate change is crucial for the planet and the long-term health  of our business. 1. Set strong targets based on science. Policymakers should  set national or regional targets that seek to limit warming to no  more than 1.5° Celsius. These goals need to include interim  targets and mechanisms to enforce short-term accountability. To meet these targets requires a price on carbon and parallel  participation in international policy negotiation. 2. Create sector-specific policies. Limiting warming to  1.5° Celsius is a goal that requires actions across the entire  economy. Policies need to address sector-specific needs and  facilitate the transition to decarbonize industries where there  are challenges or there is a need for infrastructure to support  the goal. 3. Support a green economy for all. Climate policies should  have positive, long-term fiscal impacts and support the  development of the new green economy, with job opportunities  focused on advancing clean innovation. We’re pursuing clean energy policies in countries where we  operate. In Europe, Apple called on European leaders to increase  their climate ambition to achieve a target of at least 55 percent  of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieve climate  neutrality by 2050. The EU—which adopted this standard in  December of 2020—serves as an example for how policy  ambition is crucial for climate progress and how companies like  Apple can play a role in showing how economic and climate  progress go hand in hand. Last year in Seoul, we hosted members of RE100, a global  initiative of some of the world’s most influential businesses  committed to 100 percent renewable electricity. In Vietnam,  we advocated for government action to enable companies  to purchase renewable energy. Also, in Japan, we became  the first of several multinationals to join the Japan Climate  Leader’s Partnership, which aligns business objectives with  environmental goals. Our own goals show our commitment to these principles,   as our 2030 emissions reduction target aligns with the  actions needed to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. As of December 2020,  our display suppliers  have installed mitigation  technologies to reduce  F-GHG emissions  associated with  producing all of our  display panels by more  than 90 percent on  average. Some materials that are integral to our  products result in significant emissions. The same is true for certain manufacturing  processes. To address these emissions we  seek technological solutions, either through  emissions abatement or switching to   low-carbon fuel options. Many Apple products utilize aluminum as a signature material— it is strong, durable, and enhances the longevity of devices. But,  the current smelting process for producing aluminum used by  manufacturers around the world is carbon-intensive. For the first  time, aluminum smelted with a direct emissions-free process is  being used in production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro. This innovation, called Elysis, is the result of a joint venture of  two aluminum manufacturers. The venture aims to commercialize  patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas  emissions from the traditional smelting process. This aligned with  our goals to reduce emissions associated with our products—and  to pursue innovations that can carry industry-wide impact. Apple  and the governments of Canada and Quebec have joined with the  founders of Elysis to invest in research and development of the  technology. Part of this funding is being used to construct a new  facility in Quebec. Once finished, this R&D facility will significantly  scale the carbon-free smelting technology, making this high- performance, low-emissions material available commercially. Many components essential to products like ours, including  integrated circuit (IC) chips and display panels, currently  rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases. We’re partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent  these gases from being released into the atmosphere, where  they have high global warming potential. First, we encourage  suppliers to optimize manufacturing processes—reducing the  use of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHG) in the first place. Then we ask suppliers to deploy abatement technologies,  curtailing the release of emissions from the gases that remain. As of December 2020, our display suppliers have installed  mitigation technologies to reduce F-GHG emissions associated  with producing all of our display panels by more than 90 percent  on average. Since the launch of our efforts in 2019, our key  display suppliers have reduced the equivalent of more than  2,300,000 annualized metric tons of CO2e. Each year, we ship hundreds of millions of products from  our manufacturers to our consumers. We’ve approached  this process as we have other carbon emissions objectives. We’re shifting toward less carbon-intensive shipping methods,  like rail and maritime carriers, where possible. And we’re seeking  out technical innovations, including alternative fuels and  electric vehicles. HomePod recently launched using lower-carbon forms of  transportation, significantly reducing emissions associated  with shipping. In Europe, we’re working with carriers who prioritize  “carbon neutral delivery” using electric vehicles, including e-bikes  and e-cars. These innovations help reduce our impact in the  communities where our customers purchase our products. And by preferring vendors that offer low-carbon options, we  signal the value of these options to us and reward those driving  decarbonization in their industry. We are also exploring ways to reduce our carbon footprint  from employee commuting. Although the Covid-19 pandemic  significantly impacted the number of our employees commuting  to Apple facilities and retail stores—temporarily reducing our  carbon footprint—our strategy to reduce commuting-related  emissions looks beyond this to the long term. Our efforts  incorporate remote working through our At Home Advisor  program, while also transitioning away from single-occupancy  vehicles through mass transit, coach services, and campus  bicycles. We also offer more than 2300 EV charging stations  across our U.S.-based campuses. In total, these initiatives  have helped us reduce our CO2e emissions by more than  16,000 metric tons in fiscal year 2020. Through donations, Apple works with a diverse set of partners  to enhance environmental protections and support global  communities. For the launch of the Apple TV+ documentary,  The Elephant Queen, Apple partnered with Conservation  International and Save the Elephants to support community- based elephant conservation in Kenya—including improved  elephant tracking and the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary. Apple also celebrated the 104th birthday of the national parks  with a donation to the National Park Foundation. With support  from Apple, the National Park Foundation’s youth programs  have given thousands of kids the chance to learn about and  experience the parks through school activities, trips, and service  corps programs. These programs include efforts to bring youth  from underserved communities into the parks and recruit interns  from historically black colleges and universities. Our goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2030  requires more than reducing emissions. To address the emissions we can’t avoid for  the foreseeable future, we need to take active  steps to remove carbon dioxide from the  atmosphere. This is a necessary complement  to our emissions reduction efforts—and an  essential pillar of our strategy. The purpose of our carbon removal work is clear and urgent. All global actors need to take immediate action to combat climate  change. That’s why we’ve set our goal to reduce emissions by  75 percent by 2030. And why we use the best tools available  today to remove the remainder of our emissions: nature- based solutions. Nature provides some of the best tools to remove carbon from  the atmosphere. Forests, wetlands, and grasslands draw carbon  from the atmosphere and store it away in their soils, roots, and  branches. This approach not only is proven and scalable, but  also provides livelihoods for local communities and improves  ecosystems. That’s why we’ve begun with nature-based carbon  removal solutions to support our goal of achieving carbon  neutrality across our full product life cycle by 2030. In developing our strategy, we recognize that forest restoration  and habitat protection don’t always have to be a cost, but can  represent an investment opportunity. That is why we’re partnering  with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the  Restore Fund. Apple will invest up to US$200 million in projects  that aim to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere, all  while meeting clear social and environmental impact criteria and  offering a financial return. How these investments will perform is of critical importance. Our partnership with Conservation International and Goldman  Sachs helps ensure the impact of investments, by seeking  out projects that meet the highest environmental and social  standards. The Restore Fund will align with international standards  developed by organizations such as Verra, the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change, and the UN Climate Convention, which  ensure that the carbon stored in forests is being conservatively  and accurately quantified, and is permanently locked out of  
the atmosphere. We will also share our measurements through  international registries to ensure transparency and accuracy— and that any emissions savings aren’t counted twice. This will also  involve close engagement with local and indigenous communities  to respect and protect their rights and livelihoods. Our priorities  will focus on projects that protect lands with high conservation  values and that use native species to maintain and restore  biodiversity in the areas that we restore. To ensure the integrity  of these programs, we will work with independent auditors to  verify our impact. In its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goal of removing more  than 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year with impact  scaling up over time. By 2030, we aim to remove enough carbon  dioxide from the atmosphere to cover the residual emissions  that we are unable to avoid directly within our value chain. This fund is unique because it changes carbon removal from  a cost to a profitable investment. Through creating a fund that  generates both a financial return as well as real and measurable  carbon impact, we aim to drive broader change in the future— encouraging capital investment in carbon removal around  the globe. Long-term carbon removal solutions, like the fund, will help us  reach neutrality for our end-to-end carbon footprint. At the same  time, we are not waiting to address our corporate emissions in  the short term. As of April 2020, Apple has been carbon neutral  across all of our corporate emissions—including stores, data  centers, and corporate facilities—as well as business travel and  employee commuting. We’ve already addressed the vast majority  of our corporate emissions through renewable energy and  energy efficiency efforts. However, the carbon footprint of some  activities is difficult to avoid today—whether it is emissions from  the use of natural gas in some of our buildings or the emissions  from employee air travel. To address these emissions as the  Restore Fund comes online, we partnered with Conservation  International on projects that generate carbon credits to cover  our corporate footprint.

In Kilifi, Kenya, just south of the Arabuko  Sokoke National Reserve, a forestry business   is seeking to change the way commercial  forestry operates in this region of Africa. Komaza is a “micro-forestry” company that partners with and  empowers tens of thousands of marginalized farmers to earn a  living from sustainable tree farming. The company works with  farmers from planting, to harvesting, to processing—supporting   an eight-year growth cycle to create responsible wood products. There is an urgent need for the work that Komaza is doing. Across  Africa, the demand for wood has grown with rising populations in  tandem with rapid urbanization—at a rate that far exceeds what  the continent’s forests can provide. This has led to increased  deforestation and the cascading effects of damage to critical  ecosystems, including the loss of biodiversity and increased  carbon emissions. By blending sustainable practices with a  scalable approach to commercial forestry, Komaza is aiming to  reverse these impacts, while supporting the livelihood and   well-being of local communities. Apple is partnering with Conservation International and Komaza  to invest in the micro-forestry model and its positive impacts on  carbon removal, biodiversity conservation, and socio-economic  development. Through our partnership, Conservation International  will help Komaza measure and value the carbon removal impact   of this forestry work to produce verified carbon credits. These efforts build on our history of work to protect and restore  critical ecosystems including forests, wetlands, and grasslands  around the world. Through our partnerships with World Wildlife  Fund and The Conservation Fund, we have protected or improved  the management of over 1 million acres of forests in China and the  U.S. And in 2018, we partnered with Conservation International,  INVEMAR Research Institute, and CVS (Corporación Autónoma  Regional del Valles del Sinú) to protect and restore 27,000 acres   of mangrove forest in Colombia. Mangroves are critical  ecosystems at both the local and global scales. They fortify  coastlines, supporting local communities and their livelihoods. And mangrove forests also sequester more than 10 times the  carbon than forests on land. Our partnership with Conservation  International was the first project to accurately capture the value  of this “blue carbon” and, for the first time in 2021, the project will  issue carbon credits that help to further conservation efforts in  the region. We have also partnered with Conservation International in Kenya  to protect and restore savanna with the Maasai Wilderness  Conservation Trust and the Big Life Foundation in the iconic  Chyulu Hills region. Our funds will help to repair damage caused  by unsustainable land-use practices that degrade grasslands and  soils, endanger local wildlife, release carbon into the atmosphere,  and deprive local communities of vital agricultural resources. Both the mangrove and savanna ecosystems have significant  carbon removal benefits—as well as offering an opportunity to  work with local partners to make a direct impact. These solutions  complement our existing efforts to find efficiencies and reduce  the carbon footprint of our operations. As we work to maintain  our carbon neutrality each year, these projects represent an  investment in ecosystems that will last for generations. Last year, we made our most ambitious commitment yet—to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. The resources we  depend on to make our products have a significant impact on this goal. This is yet another reason to make the most of  the resources we use—through our work to one day make our products using only recycled and renewable materials,  to build long-lasting products with a lower carbon intensity, and to create recycling technologies to end our reliance on  carbon-intensive mining. And all of these efforts also help conserve the earth’s finite resources. We take responsibility for our relationship  with all of the resources that make our work  possible. Our efforts to responsibly source  materials, minimize water use, and eliminate  waste are directly connected to the creation  of our products—and span both our own  operations and those of our suppliers. We start by looking at our products and the resources we use  to make them. We’re moving toward a future where we build  products using only recycled and renewable materials, and  at the same time, implement low-carbon designs. We aim to  build durable, long-lasting products to make the best use of the  resources inside them. When a product is ready to be recycled,  we’re engaging partners and designing technologies to recover  raw materials for new products. Water is another vital resource for our business. We rely on it to  manufacture products and run our offices, data centers, and  stores. That’s why we are optimizing our current use, leveraging  alternative and recycled sources of water, and managing our  discharge responsibly. We’re working to eliminate landfill waste—to conserve the world’s  resources and protect those communities disproportionately  exposed to waste. We make progress by reducing the amount we  create, recycling wherever possible, and innovating opportunities  for reuse. This is a collaborative effort. Our suppliers have the  greatest ability to help us conserve resources, to realize the  potential for recycling, and to lower our carbon footprint by  doing more with less. Materials  Transition to only recycled or renewable  materials in our products and packaging,  and maximize material efficiency, product  longevity, and recovery. Zero waste to landfill  Minimize overall waste generated and  eliminate waste sent to landfill from key  manufacturing facilities as well as corporate  offices, data centers, and retail stores. Water stewardship  Reduce freshwater use, transition to  alternative sources, improve the quality  of water we discharge, and protect  shared water resources. Our products rely on the availability of   high-quality materials. We’re increasingly  sourcing more of these valuable commodities  from circular supply chains, drawn from  recycled content and renewable resources. Our goal is to one day achieve independence from mined  resources—those continually extracted from the earth in a  carbon-intensive process. As we progress toward this goal,  we’re doing so without sacrificing the quality and durability of  our products. And we’re working on innovations in recycling to  enhance material recovery and support circular supply chains  for ourselves and others. The scale of this challenge is significant. But so is our potential  to have an impact. The changes that we push forward affect the  people who interact with our products, influence the markets  in which we operate, and create change for broader global  communities. Whether through technological innovation or by  achieving regulatory cooperation, our actions carry results that  extend beyond our business. • Sourcing and efficiency: Sourcing recycled and  renewable materials for our products and packaging,  and using these materials more efficiently. And we source  materials responsibly, whether from virgin, recycled, or  renewable sources. • Product longevity: Making the most of the materials we use  through designing long-lasting products. We design durable  hardware, leverage software updates to extend functionality,  provide convenient access to repair services, refurbish  devices for their next user, and reuse parts with more to give. • Product end-of-life: Enhancing product collection and  recycling innovation, so we and others can use old devices  as raw material sources for the future. For the last few years, we’ve worked diligently  toward the goal of relying solely on recycled  and renewable materials for our products and  our packaging. We’ve signaled to markets that we care about the source of our  materials—and seek those that can be used continually without  depleting the earth’s resources. Many partners have joined us in  these efforts, and we hope to engage others as we see a broader  global transition. We continue to source materials responsibly and  use materials efficiently in the design of new products. Last year, we saw progress across materials—from expanding  our use of recycled aluminum enclosures to sourcing solder  made with recycled tin. In October, we introduced iPhone 12 and  iPhone 12 Pro, the first Apple products made with 99 percent  recycled tungsten and 98 percent recycled rare earth elements. And we released seven products with more than 20 percent  recycled content. MacBook Air with Retina display (2020) had  the highest total—made with more than 40 percent recycled  content device-wide, including 100 percent recycled aluminum  in the enclosure. These and other innovations helped us increase  our use of recycled or renewable content to 12 percent of all the  material used in products this year. And more than half of our  recycled materials have been third-party certified.20 
We continue to focus our efforts on our 14 priority materials,  which accounted for more than 90 percent of the total product  mass shipped to customers in fiscal year 2020. We prioritized  these materials based on their environmental, social, and supply  impacts outlined in their Material Impact Profiles. This year, we  expanded the profiles to include a new indicator for biodiversity,  helping us assess the likelihood that a material may come from  critical habitats. We recognize that mining activities affect local  species and ecosystems, so with this and other information  captured in the profiles, we prioritize materials to switch to  recycled and renewable sources. At the same time, we’re adhering to rigorous sourcing  standards. Our recycled and renewable material specifications  follow standards set out by the international community. To ensure that these materials meet our requirements, we  ask our suppliers for third-party certifications.21 This helps  us confirm a material has been recycled or comes from a  renewable source—one that can continually produce without  depleting the earth’s resources.22 As we introduce materials  from new sources, we continue to evaluate each for its  chemical safety. This allows us to scale our use of materials  that are better for the environment, while ensuring they are  also safe for use in our products. This diligence carries over to our efforts to source responsibly,  regardless of whether we are using virgin or recycled  materials. This is a natural extension of our environmental  efforts—and it draws from the same reliance on international  standards. Our Responsible Sourcing Standards are based on  leading international guidance, including the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) due diligence guidance. In 2020, 100 percent of the identified tin, tantalum, tungsten,  gold, cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners in Apple’s  supply chain participated in an independent third-party audit  program. We also map and conduct additional diligence  on other materials in our products. We’re partnering with  the smelters and refiners identified through this process  as we build supply chains for recycled material as well. And we continue to engage with the Responsible Materials  Initiative—a multi-industry initiative focused on responsible  mineral sourcing issues—and other industry partners to  promote transparency across supply chains and to establish  additional auditing and due diligence systems. Our efforts to use recycled and renewable materials also  support our climate goals. In most cases, the recycled  content has a lower carbon footprint than primary materials. As we continue to drive efficient, sustainable use of the  earth’s resources, we’re working with policymakers to  support international standards that enable the use of  these materials globally. Apple is committed  to setting the highest  standards for responsible  sourcing of the  materials used in our  products. For more  information, read our  Supplier Responsibility  Report and our Conflict  Minerals Report on the  following site: Supplier  Responsibility. We’re prioritizing  14 materials to   transition to   recycled and renewable  content:   Aluminum   Cobalt  Copper  Glass  Gold  Lithium  Paper  Plastics  Rare earth elements  Steel  Tantalum  Tin  Tungsten  Zinc Found in products MacBook Air  MacBook Pro  27-inch iMac   Mac Pro   Pro Display XDR   Mac mini  iPad Pro   iPad Air  iPad  iPad mini   iPhone The next part of the process was supply chain architecture: the  important task of getting the recycled raw material to our parts  suppliers. While tungsten is widely recycled, the streams come  from varied sources and are of differing qualities. One challenge   is that tungsten used in industrial applications creates two   distinct types of scrap. And we found through our testing that  only one—which goes through a more complicated recycling  process—could be used in our applications. Once this new supply chain was in place, we had established the  path to using 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. And this transition creates impact—we will avoid using the  equivalent of an estimated 300,000 metric tons of mined material  by sourcing recycled tungsten for iPhone 12 and Apple Watch  Series 6. Some of the impact of our work extends beyond  our own footprint as well. By building a supply chain solely for  recycled content, we helped advance the market for this recycled  material and further incentivize recovery across our industry. Tungsten is one of the many materials that  help make Apple products come to life. It is  a key metal used in our Taptic Engine, which  gives devices like iPhone and Apple Watch  their unique feel through haptic feedback. It is also a material we’ve prioritized as we  actively source recycled alternatives. Last fall marked a significant achievement in our journey—we  released iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 6 with 100 percent  recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. This meant we used  99 percent recycled tungsten in each device, and this marked   a first for a smartphone. This achievement grew out of many years of work. We kicked  off this effort in 2016, in parallel with our goal of finding recycled  sources for metals like tin, by mapping the supply chain and  identifying available recycled content. We eventually identified  a recycler that produced 100 percent recycled tungsten— showing us that our goal was possible. We continued to engage  suppliers to use the recycled material until we reached scale;  in some cases, working with suppliers to revamp their entire  manufacturing processes to focus only on recycled inputs. Locating and sourcing recycled material was one element of the  process. The other, equally important task is to verify that this  resource will perform at the level required for our products. With  tungsten, we undertook more than a year of testing to determine  whether we could utilize the recycled material provided by the  new sources. Eventually, we determined that the recycled content  did meet our rigorous standards. Above: We use 100 percent  recycled tungsten in the  Taptic Engine of iPhone 12,  which represents 99 percent  of the total tungsten in   the device. The transition to recycled and  renewable resources presents  inherent challenges, as well as  opportunities. By engaging each,  we’ve made progress and gained  a clear understanding of the  task ahead. Regulatory barriers: Transboundary movement   regulations—originally intended to create environmental  protections—inadvertently inhibit the ability to recover   materials from scrap, end-of-life products, and parts for   use in new products. Contamination: The manner in which materials are recovered for  recycling can impact the composition of the material, reducing its  purity and usability. Technical properties: Recycled or renewable material may   have unique technical properties that need to be accounted   for in product design. Availability: End-of-life products and industrial sources of scrap  for recycling may not be readily available, constraining the supply  of recycled material. And the production of renewable material is  sometimes limited. Supply chains: Recycled or renewable content may not be easily  accessible on the market, requiring the development of new  supply chains. After creating a new aluminum alloy that incorporates recycled  content without compromising product performance, we’re now  scaling recycled content across products. We continue to use  100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of Apple Watch,  MacBook Air, and Mac mini, and expanded to iPad and iPad Air. The transition to recycled aluminum also produced a significant  carbon savings—supporting our pursuit of low-carbon designs. Our recycled material comes from several sources, including  Apple’s manufacturing scrap and post-industrial sources. And in 2020, we expanded our sourcing of recycled aluminum  to include post-consumer scrap recovered from building and  construction projects. We’ve worked to increase our recycled cobalt year after year— doubling the amount of recycled material used in fiscal year 2020  from the previous year. And the cobalt from iPhone batteries  disassembled by Daisy is being returned to the general market. This more efficient and economical approach makes the material  available to others beyond our supply chain, and continues to  create a positive environmental benefit. We’re reducing the copper needed to build key components,  while also piloting the use of high quantities of recycled content. We’re continuing to use foils that rely on less copper in our printed  circuit boards (PCBs), where we’ve also incorporated copper from  recycled sources. We’re working to apply this same approach to  the foils we use in batteries and other modules. We’ve worked to incorporate recycled content into the   material we use to produce glass parts—keeping glass at its  highest-purity use. As we collect and reuse scrap in new parts,  we use the material more efficiently. And this year we used  recycled glass in multiple parts of our iPhone devices—including  the cover glass. We have looked to both increase the use of recycled content and  reduce the amount of gold required to make components, and at  the same time, we’re supporting greater transparency in global  supply chains. We’ve focused some of our reduction efforts on reassessing the  gold plating requirements in our components. Through this,   we were able to build the printed circuit board for iPhone 12   with 50 percent less gold plating than the prior generation. We also continue to pursue the use of recycled material where  possible—including 100 percent certified recycled gold on the  plating of select circuit boards for iPhone. We’re working to shift our use of virgin sources of lithium to  recycled materials recovered from batteries, as these options  become more viable and economical. This involves testing to  ensure the recycled material meets our performance standards. And we’re forging relationships with partners and recyclers  capable of bringing more of this material into the market. Paper Packaging  Technical properties Progress toward our 2025 commitment to eliminate plastics  in packaging centers around switching to innovative fiber  replacements. We’re expanding the number of products that use  fiber-based packaging and creating new fiber-based designs,  like the paper screen films on iPhone 12. As we use more fiber,  we continue to engage in circular supply chains that recycle and  regenerate fiber sources. All of the wood fiber in our packaging  comes from recycled materials or responsibly managed forests. And we’re upholding our commitment to protect or create  responsibly managed forests sufficient to cover the amount of  wood fiber we use in our packaging. By educating customers on  the recyclability of our packaging, we aim to contribute back to  the recycled material market as well. Plastics encompass a wide range of materials, and we’re  continuing to identify recycled plastics that meet our high  standards. And we’re scaling the use of these materials across  our products. The mesh fabric of HomePod mini, for example,  is made with 90 percent recycled plastic. And we use 100  percent recycled polyester yarns in the Apple Watch Braided  Solo Loop.25 In total, we introduced more than 70 parts with an  average of 50 percent recycled plastic in fiscal year 2020. And 17 additional components used plastics made from   bio-based content rather than fossil fuels, an important step   as we continue to pursue certified renewable plastic sources. After proving we could make a high-performance magnet using  only recycled rare earth elements, we’re focused on expanding  use across devices. We’ve successfully introduced recycled  rare earth magnets in several products this year including  Apple Watch, HomePod mini, iPad Air—and most notably,  iPhone including MagSafe accessories. iPhone 12 uses the  highest concentration of any iPhone yet: 98 percent recycled  rare earth elements in the whole device. We’re also working to  reduce the total material used. By switching to a new cutting  technology, we reduced the rare earth elements needed to  manufacture MagSafe components by 12 percent. This year, we saw the results of our efforts to reduce the  total amount of steel in the iPhone 11 Pro enclosures, saving  nearly 10,000 metric tons of steel in fiscal year 2020. And  we continued to improve steel efficiency in iPhone 12 Pro  manufacturing. This is an example of our low-carbon design  approach, which seeks to increase the use of recycled materials  and decrease the total amount of material required. Since   steel is highly recycled, our main focus is keeping it in the   highest-quality form possible. That’s why we continue to  work to make sure high-purity steel gets recovered from our  manufacturing scrap and our products at end-of-life. While a market exists for recycled tantalum, we continue to  address the challenge of building new supply chains to provide  100 percent recycled content at the quality and scale we  need. Recovery from end-of-life electronics remains an area of  opportunity that we’re actively investigating to develop further  use of this recycled material. In fiscal year 2020, more than 25 percent of our tin came  from recycled sources as we continued to scale our use. Our  focus remains on its application in the solder of the main logic  boards of our iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and select Mac devices. We’re also continuing to use recycled tin in our accessories,  including our power adapters and the Wireless Charging Case  for AirPods Pro. And we introduced recycled tin solder on  the True Tone flash of iPad Pro and the wireless charger for  Apple Pencil as well. In 2020, we used 100 percent recycled tungsten in the   Taptic Engine of iPhone and Apple Watch for the first time,  which represents 99 percent of the total tungsten in the device. In total, more than 35 percent of the tungsten we used in fiscal  year 2020 came from recycled sources. And with the help of  our disassembly robots, Daisy and Dave, the tungsten from  our Taptic Engine can be recovered and recycled. We continue to work to identify high-quality sources of recycled  zinc, a challenge as the material is prone to accumulate  impurities during recycling. And each source we identify, we  rigorously test to ensure the recycled materials meet our high  performance standards. Packaging fiber and plastic footprint* (metric tons)  We’ve reduced plastic in our packaging by 65 percent since 2015. And since 2017,   100 percent of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources. The final step in the iPhone unboxing  process—peeling back the protective film  covering the screen—marks the moment  when the device is ready to be used. This year,  iPhone 12 owners will notice something new  when they unbox their devices. We’ve replaced the traditional transparent protective plastic  film with a paper alternative. It’s a small detail, but part of our  larger goal to eliminate all plastics in our packaging by 2025. We’ve made significant progress toward this goal since 2015,  replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with  fiber alternatives. These changes have allowed us to drastically  cut plastic use, including an 80 percent reduction in plastic  packaging in the 16-inch MacBook Pro. In fiscal year 2020, all  newly released iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook devices  shipped in packaging made with more than 90 percent fiber. Now we’re focusing on the detailed work of addressing the  smaller, but no less significant, uses of plastic. The pouch  enclosing Apple Watch, for example, is made from paper,  as are the folded wraps securing cables for iPad, iPhone,  AirPods, and MacBook. And we supply the wood fiber for  all of our packaging from recycled sources or responsibly  managed forests.26 
We’ve set these goals as part of our broader strategy to reduce  waste through eliminating single-use plastics and focusing on  recycled and renewable materials in our products and packaging. And as countries around the world adopt regulatory efforts with  similar goals, we find ourselves ahead of the curve in meeting new  requirements. For example, our transition to paper bags in our  retail stores anticipated local regulations on plastic bags in select  regions. As countries from Argentina to Spain consider regulations  to reduce waste, we also advocate for action that promotes the  efficient use of low-impact materials, reduces single-use plastics,  and encourages requirements that consider the entire packaging  life cycle. Our ability to proactively meet new standards not only serves the  environment, it makes business sense. We’re able to tackle design,  sourcing, and logistical challenges thoughtfully and in alignment  with all of our goals and efforts. This includes our commitment  to using responsibly sourced wood fiber while, at the same time,  contributing to the global supply of these responsible materials. Through partnerships with The Conservation Fund and the World  Wildlife Fund, we’ve protected more than 1 million acres of working  forests in the U.S. and China. In fiscal year 2020, these forests  generated enough responsibly sourced fiber to balance all the   fiber used in our packaging.27  
Our white paper on   Apple’s Paper and   Packaging Strategy   (PDF) details our   approach toward  creating responsibly  designed and sourced  packaging. *  These data include the materials used in our packaging. Fiber used at our corporate facilities represents less than 1 percent of our overall fiber use. ** Since 2017, all of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in   Apple’s Sustainable Fiber Specification (PDF). We consider wood fibers to include bamboo. *  iPhone X and iPhone 12 models are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions. iPhone X has a rating of IP67 under IEC standard  60529 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes). iPhone 12 has a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water,  and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for  cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty. Our customers expect their devices to be ready when they  need them, with minimal interruption for maintenance or repair. We believe designing long-lasting products encourages our  customers to come back to Apple for their next one. And by  encouraging our customers to access the value of their current  device through Apple Trade In or third-party trade-in platforms,  not only are we making their next purchase more affordable—we  are also enabling a new customer to experience Apple products  and services. And this approach is good for the planet. Keeping a  product in use as long as possible—whether for one customer or  more over the course of the product’s life—enables us to get the  most out of the resources used to build the product. Because our design process prioritizes longevity, iPhone devices  hold their value for longer than the competition. Apple delivers  on our commitment to provide long-lasting devices by building  durable hardware designed to endure the rigors of everyday  use, offering years of software updates to unlock new features  and functionality, and providing convenient access to safe and  reliable repair services for whenever they might be needed. We  aim to support the broadest range of devices possible so more  customers can benefit from advances in software, whether  their device is new or several generations older. We also strive  to continuously improve durability with every generation of a  product by delivering features that minimize the need for repair,  such as water resistance and better drop performance. And we’re  improving the repairability of devices and expanding options Above: A solar test replicates  and accelerates the UV  exposure a product would  experience by a window or in  full sunlight over its lifetime. With each new product, we strive to improve on the durability of  the prior generation. Last fall, we released iPhone 12 with Ceramic  Shield, a transparent ceramic cover glass that has four times  better drop performance than the previous generation.28  It is an innovation that contributes to the durability of each device,  minimizes the need for replacement parts, and helps retain  product value that customers can access through trade in. This  advancement enhances durability alongside features like the IP68  water resistance of iPhone 12.29 And each improvement we make  is one more step in our ongoing journey to creating even more  durable products. for repair around the world—including to independent repair  businesses—so our customers can access repair services should  they need it. Put together, it’s no surprise that our active installed  base of products grew to 1.65 billion devices in the last year. We design for durability because long-lasting products that  minimize repair or replacement make for a better customer  experience. Apple products are designed to endure daily life, and  an essential element of the product experience is confidence in  the reliability of the device. This work involves developing innovative designs that are  engineered to withstand rigorous conditions, coupled with  testing to assess them against our strict durability standards. We set these standards according to in-depth user studies  to understand how our customers use—and misuse—their  products. To measure against these requirements, we design  custom test methods to better simulate real-world   conditions—like an accidental drop. During each product’s development, thousands of units are  tested, and each test informs the next round of design. Engineers  in our Reliability Testing Lab measure the performance of  materials, components, and fully assembled products to ensure  every aspect of our product is thoroughly assessed for durability. For example, Apple Watch prototypes are exposed to different  liquids like pool water, ocean water, and synthetic sweat to make  sure devices are ready to be used during exercise. With our drop  tower, we let products fall from dozens of different heights and  angles onto a range of surfaces to improve their resilience to an  accidental drop. And we test recycled or renewable materials to  the same performance standards as other materials—making  sure our products stay as durable as ever, even as we explore  new material sources. Through our iterative testing approach, we  continuously improve designs until they meet our strict standards  and are ready to face the world. We design our products for durability in order to minimize the  need for repair. But in the instance a repair is needed, we believe  our customers should have convenient access to safe and  reliable repair services, to get their product back up and running  as quickly as possible. We are continuing to broaden the availability of repair services  around the world. Our customers can receive repair with genuine  parts, whether they go to an Apple Store, Apple Authorized  Service Provider (AASP), participating Independent Repair  Provider, mail-in repair center, or receive onsite service. We have grown our network to over 5000 AASP locations and  over 1500 Independent Repair Providers around the world. Our Independent Repair Provider program, now in its second year,  is designed to enable independent repair businesses—large and  small—to have access to Apple genuine parts, tools, diagnostics,  and training. The program underwent two major changes in  2020: expansion to Europe and Canada, and inclusion of Mac  repair in addition to iPhone repair. We’re also increasing coverage  for onsite service options in select cities across the United States,  providing the ultimate convenience to our customers. And we’ve  trained more than 265,000 repair technicians to provide quality  repair support. We’re also improving the repairability of many  of our products. The new iPhone 12 design, for example, allows  for more repairs to be performed at more repair locations than  ever before. We’re constantly working to improve the convenience of our  repair services as well as the durability of our devices. And   we know there’s more work to be done on this journey. Product longevity relies as much on software support as it does  on durable hardware design. Our customers expect us to deliver  the latest software features and security updates to their existing  devices for years. That’s why we work to continually improve the  operating systems that power our products. We engineer each  software release to make sure it runs beautifully on all supported  devices. This helps us maximize the number of customers who  benefit from the latest software updates, regardless of whether  their device is brand new or several generations older. iOS 14, our most recent release, extends support back to  iPhone 6s (2015). iPadOS 14 compatibility goes back to iPad Air 2  (2014) and macOS Big Sur supports MacBook models from  2013 onward. The updates in each operating system make the  latest capabilities—from widgets on iPhone to the latest macOS  design—available to a broad user base, keeping their devices up  to date and extending their usability. These updates also ensure  that more customers have access to the newest security and  privacy features available. Many of our customers are eager to use these updates. By February 2021, 86 percent of all iPhone devices introduced  in the last four years had updated to iOS 14. And iPadOS 14 was  being used on 84 percent of devices released in the last four  years. Our continually high rates of adoption show that   our customers value these software updates. Products that last longer make the best use of the resources  we rely on to create them. By finding ways to refurbish and  reuse these products, we can lower each device’s impact on the  environment—including their carbon intensity per year of life. And by building our products to serve more than one owner and  encouraging customers to exchange devices for an upgrade, we  extend the life of our products. We collect devices for refurbishing through a number of programs  including Apple Trade In, the iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare,  and our corporate Hardware Reuse Program. In fiscal year 2020,  we sent 10.4 million devices to be refurbished for new users. We’ve also expanded our Trade In program to 25 countries, to  make this program as convenient and accessible as possible to  our customers. Our customers drive the success of our trade-in programs and  those of third parties. Whether through trading in their devices,  passing down their device to a family member, or purchasing  refurbished products, their actions recognize the long-term  value we’ve designed and built into our products. And it enables  us to make progress toward our goals of reducing our overall  environmental footprint. After extending the life of devices for as long as possible, we aim  to do the same for the parts inside. Through recovery and reuse  of components from products at end-of-life, we can realize their  potential—either using them for replacement parts or in new  creative applications. By extending their use as long as possible,  we’re making the most of the materials and energy needed to  build them in the first place. We’ve expanded our efforts to recover more parts from   end-of-life devices for reuse. Those parts that can be refurbished  to our high quality and performance standards can be reused  as replacements. We’re then able to repair more devices while  creating fewer spare parts. Our teams continue to look for  innovative opportunities to reuse accessories sent for recycling as  well. For example, we send collected power cables and adapters  to our final assembly sites, where they power production lines. Visit our Certified  Refurbished site where  we offer like-new products  backed by a one-year  warranty and the Apple  Certified Refurbished  promise.30 Our responsibility for our products begins with  the design process and carries through end- of-life. While we first look for opportunities  for reuse, a product or part that no longer  functions as intended can still be a source  of valuable materials. Through recycling we can realize the potential of these sources. And by keeping materials in the highest-quality form possible,  we can reduce the energy needed to manufacture new products,  driving down emissions. It is through this outlook on the end- of-life of our products that we can design and build the next  generation of devices even better for our planet. Our approach toward creating circular supply chains rests on  how well we recycle our products. Making recycling options  easy and accessible is key to these efforts. At our retail locations,  our customers not only can experience and purchase our latest  products, but also can recycle devices they’re no longer using. Through both retail and online platforms like Trade In, we continue  to provide product take-back and recycling collection programs  in 99 percent of the countries where we sell products. These  programs allowed us to direct more than 39,000 metric tons of  e-waste to recycling globally in fiscal year 2020. To do this, we seek out and partner with recyclers who are  the best-in-class, those who show high recovery rates and  can uphold our standards. To ensure the effectiveness of  these partnerships, we audit our recyclers for compliance with  environmental, health, and safety regulations, and encourage best  practices. In fiscal year 2020, we conducted more than 50 audits  globally—and we performed additional audits relating to security. And all of our recyclers in North America are either e-Stewards or  R2 certified, the electronics industry’s leading certifications. We also partner with recyclers to make sure there is a recycling  solution for each Apple product. This is a collaborative effort. Through training and ongoing support, we help our recycling  partners develop the ability to disassemble our products,  recovering as much material as possible while limiting waste. This year, we’ve also launched new Apple Recycler Guides  to provide guidance for professional electronics recyclers on  how to safely disassemble Apple products—and maximize  recovery of resources. The guides provide valuable insight on the  steps for recycling, as well as the recommended downstream  material recycler for the disassembled parts. Launched with  our Pro Display XDR, these efforts will continue to expand to  other products. Product by product, this has a cumulative effect. As we continue  to improve material recovery, we’re making sure more high-quality  recycled content is available on the market for us and others  to use. Disassembling a product for recycling presents an inherent  challenge: What is the best way to minimize waste and maximize  recovery? We’ve approached this challenge at our Material  Recovery Lab (MRL) based in Austin, Texas, where our team  works on developing better, more efficient recycling technologies. In 2020, our engineers worked virtually with this year’s class of  MRL interns from universities across the U.S. and Canada to  innovate new approaches to disassembly. We’ve continued to build upon our recycling innovations. Dave,  our newest recycling robot, disassembles the Taptic Engine from  iPhone to enable the recovery of key materials such as rare earth  magnets, tungsten, and steel. And, we’re exploring new ways  to expand these recovery capabilities to other products. We’re  also designing, developing, and testing additional disassembly  tools—including new methods for recovering materials from  Apple Pencil. And Daisy, our first disassembly robot, continues  to disassemble iPhone devices so recyclers can recover more  material inside. Just one metric ton of iPhone main logic boards,  flexes, and camera modules disassembled by Daisy contain the  same amount of gold and copper as an estimated 150 metric  tons of mined earth. These materials make it back to the general  market, so that we and others can use recycled materials for the  next generation of products. We support The  Recycling Partnership,  a U.S. nonprofit, in  their efforts to improve  residential recycling  across the country. In  2020, The Partnership  developed a first-of-its- kind national recycling  database that covers  97 percent of the U.S.  population, providing  real-time insights on what  materials are recyclable  locally. The Recycling  Partnership also  developed a free best  practice management  guide and tools for  communities to use   for better disposal   of e-waste and   lithium-ion batteries. We’re also taking a long-term approach to recycling innovation. While our current technologies for recovering valuable materials  continue to improve, we recognize that new and emerging  technologies represent some of the best opportunities to impact  the future. And that our investments in research and development  can yield transformative change. That’s why we’re supporting  research initiatives that fundamentally reimagine disassembly  and recovery. Our recently completed project with Carnegie Mellon University’s  Biorobotics Lab developed machine learning models to enable  better sorting of e-waste at recyclers. These software models,  which learn from different images of devices, aim to provide the  next generation of robots with the intelligence to disassemble  devices they’ve never seen before. Typically a model requires a  large amount of data—in this case, images of an object—to be  able to recognize that object for recycling. Unfortunately, this  data is not readily available. This research applies the concept  
Carnegie Mellon University is excited to work  with Apple in developing key robotics and  artificial intelligence technologies   to advance electronics recycling. Apple   is the ideal partner for their combination  of real-world experience and technical  expertise—and they are engaged at every  stage of the project. Research like this   aims to apply the latest technology to   create industry-wide change.”

The newly  developed software will be open-sourced, available to be used by  others in new applications throughout the recycling industry. The event drew representatives of 193 nations and  nongovernmental stakeholders from across the globe. Apple  was there as well. While much of our resource work centers on  innovating technical solutions to enable circular supply chains  around our products, there’s another equally important task:  advocating for the policies that support resource recovery and  reuse. Our engagement with the U.N. Environment Assembly  and other organizations, including the World Circular Economy  Forum, and Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy where  we serve on the board, furthers this goal. We’re committed to  turning these important conversations into actions, and realizing  the benefits to the environment from our preliminary successes  across our entire supply chain. And just as policies can support these efforts, they can also  present unintended obstacles. We learned this through our  experience with iPhone, where we’ve had considerable success  recovering and recycling material from our devices. For example,  the same amount of gold and copper can be recovered from one  metric ton of end-of-life iPhone modules as can be extracted  from 150 metric tons of mined earth. That same material was categorized as hazardous waste under  some regulations, making it difficult to ship and then return  parts to the supply chain. Those regulations exist to provide an  essential protection—ensuring that vulnerable communities are  protected from global waste streams. Yet we believe there is an  opportunity to adjust policies to reinforce critical protections for  these communities, while also facilitating circular supply chains  that benefit the environment. Apple is engaging in a dialogue with a diverse set of stakeholders  to find a novel solution to this challenge. We believe that countries  should have the agency to opt-in to expedite the efficient  movement of regulated materials for circular supply chains. But  that they should do so in a manner that enables the traceable and  responsible movement of recoverable material to preapproved  facilities with sound social and environmental practices. This is  aligned with the objectives of the Basel Convention and maintains  strong protections against the illegal movement of waste, while  streamlining shipments to responsible recyclers to allow for  circular supply chains to compete with extractive ones. We’re  open to engaging with and learning from thought leaders who  also believe both objectives are possible. Below: In the hands of the  right recycler, iPhone devices  disassembled by Daisy can  be a valuable source of key  materials like gold, copper,  and aluminum. Freshwater resources are increasingly scarce and vulnerable  to the effects of climate change. As a community resource,  water is shared by people and ecosystems across very different  environments. Our efforts to reduce our freshwater withdrawals  and return clean water back to the watersheds in which we  operate reflect our commitment to managing this shared  resource responsibly. We apply a context-based approach to water stewardship. The  foundation of this is a clear understanding of our local footprint. At our own facilities, we measure and continually monitor our  usage, and at our suppliers’ sites, we survey and model each  facility’s impact. This process involves understanding how we   use water and how discharge should be handled at each site. Each area has unique water conditions. Tools like the World  Wildlife Fund (WWF) Risk Filter and the World Resources  Institute (WRI) Water Risk Atlas provide us detailed profiles of  geographically specific water consumption and water-related  risks that inform our local strategy. We prioritize those areas  with high water risk—where approximately 46 percent of our  corporate water use occurs.32 Our strategy goes further to  proactively address areas of medium risk as well. This year, we’ve adopted a new approach to estimate water use in  the far reaches of our supply chain. The data we model combines  water survey data collected from more than 1200 direct suppliers  with an advanced life cycle assessment model for more accurate  estimate of upstream water use. Though it is not common in our  industry to consider the impact of the activities of these upstream  suppliers, we believe it is essential to addressing our holistic  water footprint. Our efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites  and of our suppliers’ sites focus on the following key efforts:  
As our facilities and activities grow, we’re working to address  the challenges of water usage and efficiency. We prioritize  regions with high water risk and focus our efforts on reducing the  amount we use. This is site-specific work as we and our suppliers  optimize water use for sanitation, climate control, maintaining  green spaces, or manufacturing. And we recognize we have  progress yet to make. In fiscal year 2020, our facilities used 1.29 billion gallons of  water, about 54 percent of which we discharged back into the  watershed for use by others.33 We saved 111 million gallons of  freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented  since 2017, including 11 million gallons due to new improvements  made this year.34 This progress underscores our commitment to  reducing water use. Behind these numbers are local initiatives. At our Mesa, Arizona,  data center, our efforts to upgrade infrastructure and address  inefficiencies yielded an improvement in water use efficiency. At  one of our locations in Santa Clara Valley, equipment upgrades— including an improved cooling system—resulted in almost  1 million gallons of water savings per year. While we continue to focus on our corporate water use, we  recognize that far more water is used within our supply chain. As we develop our capabilities to model this usage, we find  opportunities for water savings across locations. This requires  engagement with our manufacturers, who can work with our  supplier Clean Water program to access assessment tools  and technical guidance needed to make improvements. Some  efforts require little investment, like employee education on more  efficient rinsing processes. Others require upgrades to water- efficient equipment and wastewater reclamation systems, as  well as redesigning manufacturing locations. We partner with our  suppliers on solutions that can yield efficiencies and impact our  overall usage. The more than 172 suppliers in our Clean Water program have  already demonstrated savings from these initiatives. In 2020, they  saved 10.8 billion gallons of water, for a total of 41 billion gallons of  water savings since the launch of the program in 2013. We’re focused on reducing our reliance on freshwater sources. The more we leverage alternative sources of water at each of  our locations, the less impact we’ll have on the local watershed. These potential alternative water sources include recycled water,  reclaimed water, rainwater, and condensate. Last year, alternative water sources accounted for 9 percent  of our total corporate water usage. At Apple locations in Texas,  North Carolina, Ireland, and Japan, we utilized rainwater capture  systems to source 5 million gallons of water. We’re also piloting  advanced water recovery systems. In Santa Clara Valley, we  installed a 1200-gallon condensate recovery system to collect  water produced as a by-product of cooling and air conditioning  systems. This not only diverts water away from the local  wastewater system, it also creates an onsite source of   high-quality water reused directly for irrigation. Water use at corporate facilities We track our corporate water use for our data centers,   retail stores, and corporate offices. *  We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority   of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent   comes from groundwater. ** Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled water comes primarily from municipal treatment plants,   with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily  used for irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing. Our suppliers are also implementing freshwater alternatives. In some cases, these require a change of process to allow water  to be reused onsite. In other instances, suppliers have installed  advanced systems to clean and recycle water to allow it to  be used again. The suppliers within our Clean Water program  reused on average 40 percent of wastewater in 2020. Water is a community resource. We take seriously our  responsibility for both the quantity and the quality of water  we return to the watershed. For our corporate locations, we  estimate that 54 percent of the water we use is discharged into  the watershed for use by others.35 We ask our suppliers to do  their part as well, by adhering to the high standards for water  discharge outlined in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct. We  aim to do more than comply with local regulations governing  water discharge, whether at our facilities or our suppliers. We’re committed to preserving the health of each local watershed  where we operate. Our Prineville, Oregon, data center was the  first Apple-owned or operated site—and the first data center  worldwide—to achieve certification under the Alliance for Water  Stewardship (AWS), demonstrating our commitment to   
context-based sustainable water use in the watershed. And  also in Prineville, we partnered with the city to create an aquifer  storage and recovery system, which will achieve commercial  operation in 2021. This aquifer will hold up to 180 million gallons  of water for use in peak months, reducing pressure on the  local watershed. Through the Clean Water program, we encourage performance  that goes far beyond compliance. To date, 13 facilities have  received certification of which 10 were Platinum status, the  highest level of recognition by AWS. We are working with AWS  and WWF China to manage the Water Stewardship China  Network (WSCN). WSCN includes nearly 50 companies, local  government, and civil society organizations collaborating to  drive shared solutions at the basin-level and adoption of the  AWS Standard in high-risk areas. In 2020, we worked with  AWS and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to establish  the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) water  stewardship working group. This group will promote the adoption  of water stewardship practices throughout the industry, by  developing training materials and providing opportunities  for sharing knowledge and best practices. Our Prineville data  center is the first Apple  facility to receive TRUE  certification—meaning  more than 90 percent  of its waste is sent to  recycling or composting. This effort takes into account all materials, from kitchenware   to construction materials. And we’re working with our suppliers  to eliminate waste from manufacturing, so that we leave no  waste behind in the communities where our products are made. Countless innovations support this effort—it is our job to rethink  how we do our work to achieve it. The goal to preserve resources  is just one factor driving our efforts. This work also protects  the most vulnerable communities disproportionately exposed  to waste. We’re working to reduce and divert the waste created from  our business, whether from our offices, data centers, or retail  stores. This effort is part of our goal to send zero waste to landfill. Since our Zero Waste Program launched in 2018, our major U.S.  campuses and global retail stores have been our focus. In fiscal year 2020, we diverted more than 70 percent of our  waste to recycling or composting rather than landfill.36 And we are  excited to announce our Prineville data center is the first Apple  facility to have received TRUE certification—meaning more than  90 percent of its waste is sent to recycling or composting.37 We  achieved this by partnering with local businesses to divert our  compost and plastics, by upgrading our infrastructure to allow for  better waste separation, and by switching to reusable alternatives  from single-use materials. These high diversion rates helped limit the amount of waste sent  to landfill to about 12,000 metric tons for our global operations.38  This was a reduction compared to the previous year, resulting in  part from the temporary closure of stores and offices due to the  Covid-19 pandemic. However, our zero waste initiatives helped  reduce waste at data centers and other locations that continued  to operate. Wherever possible, our aim is to minimize waste created in the  first place. We’re working with our key suppliers to transition to  bulk, recyclable, or reusable packaging. At our Prineville data  center, we switched to reusable crates, pallets, and racks to safely  ship equipment. This decreased a key stream of waste coming  to the site and reduced disposal costs as well. The waste we can’t avoid, we work to divert from landfill. This  starts with building the right infrastructure and enhancing  messaging to ensure items end up in the correct bin. We are  rolling out consolidated bins for recycling, composting, and  landfill, and improved signage to reduce contamination and  increase recycling rates. The majority of our corporate sites  and retail stores worldwide recycle paper, plastic, aluminum, and  cardboard materials. And more than 450 of our offices and retail  stores across North America participate in composting as well. Yet our work continues to evolve as waste streams do. The health  of employees, customers, and communities is our first priority;   so we’ve supported our employees to wear all necessary personal  protective equipment for the Covid-19 pandemic. We rapidly  developed waste diversion options including a waste-to-energy  solution for face masks and gloves used in our offices in the   Santa Clara Valley and at more than 250 retail locations in the  United States.39 
We maintain our commitment to the safe and responsible  management of hazardous waste, both onsite and offsite. The Treatment, Storage, and Disposal facilities (TSDFs)  we work with are audited to ensure that the waste is treated,  recycled, or incinerated within the governing safety standards  for health and the environment. Any facility that doesn’t meet  our requirements is replaced by another approved waste facility. Above: By switching to  recycled and reusable  alternatives—including  the Recyclable Protective  Film pictured here—70  supplier sites have achieved  Zero Waste certifications. Our suppliers play an essential role in realizing our goals for zero  waste. In 2015, we launched our supplier Zero Waste Program for  our manufacturing partners. More than 165 participating facilities  can access resources including guidance on waste diversion,  tools to improve waste management, and in some cases, onsite  support. Each effort contributes to our goal. Suppliers diverted  over 400,000 metric tons of waste destined for landfills in 2020,  bringing the total to 1.65 million metric tons diverted since the  program’s inception in 2015. This is the equivalent of eliminating  more than 200,000 garbage trucks of waste sent to landfill. Building on the progress made over the past several years,  we continue to drive toward zero waste at our final assembly  sites. We’ve recently engaged facilities assembling our Beats  products, in addition to locations assembling iPhone, iPad,  Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and Apple TV. With  this latest achievement, as of December 2020, 100 percent of  established final assembly sites are now Zero Waste certified.40  We’ve continued to expand the program further to include  component manufacturing sites, with a particular focus on Apple  Watch. Select Apple Watch components, including batteries and  speakers, are already made at Zero Waste certified facilities. Across all product lines, a total of 70 suppliers achieved  certification by the end of 2020, representing a nearly   40 percent increase from 2019. This includes our Goertek  AirPods assembly site in Vietnam—a first for Apple and for  the country. We’ve supported our suppliers in achieving these certifications,  finding innovative solutions to reduce and recycle waste. We’ve  broadened the use of Recyclable Protective Film (RPF)—which  protects products during manufacturing—to Mac and iPad  product lines in addition to iPhone. By ensuring that the film is  recycled, we have been able to divert more than 4700 metric  tons of waste from incineration. We’ve also expanded the use of  a more efficient shrink-wrap to pilot AirPods, iPad, and iPhone  assembly sites—reducing material used by 25 percent. By  sharing this innovation with other industry leaders, including a  major e-commerce company in China, we hope to help expand  its impact beyond our own supply chain to other industries. The buildings where we meet and create— retail stores, data centers, offices—are key  to preserving the creativity and collaboration  unique to Apple. Our shared spaces inspire  innovation. They also reflect our values. It’s  our duty to examine the impact each of our  buildings has on the environment. Prioritizing this work starts with aligning our design and  construction criteria to industry-recognized best practices for  green buildings. These promote activities like water conservation,  energy efficiency, and responsible material sourcing. To date,  80 of our sites are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment  Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment  Environmental Assessment Method) certified. And we continue  to increase that total as we support the construction of more than  15 million square feet of green building space around the world. Our retail stores illustrate our dedication to the environment— from the early phases of design through the everyday use of  a site. This approach informed the construction of our Marina  Bay Sands retail space in Singapore. The glazing system on  the glass façade capitalizes on daylight while limiting solar  exposure. This reduces the electricity needed for both lighting  and cooling, so the overall energy performance exceeds the  ASHRAE 90.1 benchmark.41 The site also uses FSC-certified  wood materials, and meets Singapore’s Green Mark standard for  environmental performance. Our footprint extends to our corporate offices. Each project  is unique, and varies to adapt to new locations and climates. For example, at our office in Hyderabad, India, outdoor  temperatures can often reach above 100° Fahrenheit. To ensure  the efficient use of resources and a comfortable environment  for our employees, we customized the systems installed to  adjust temperature and light. Daylight sensors near windows  automatically dim or brighten based on the location of the sun. Best-in-class water-cooled chillers and HVAC systems optimize  and reduce energy use. An onsite facility treats and reuses 80  percent of the location’s wastewater for cooling, flushing, and  irrigation, reducing overall water demand. All of these processes  are closely monitored by a Building Management System,  allowing our operations teams to continually optimize energy   and resource efficiency. The Covid-19 pandemic greatly impacted the way we manage  our spaces. Over the past year, we’ve adjusted lighting and  HVAC systems across our facilities on an ongoing basis, to  adapt to reduced capacity and use patterns. As people return  to our facilities, we’re constantly monitoring occupancy levels to  determine what additional ventilation and air filtration is needed  to protect our employees. Safety remains our first priority, which  has to be considered alongside our environmental goals. Human-centric design cannot exist without considering how  the built environment interacts with the world around us. We  are constantly challenging ourselves to find new ways to build  creative spaces that prioritize the environment we all share. The well-being of our suppliers, employees, customers, and the planet is a priority for Apple, which is why  we’re committed to using safer materials to create safer products. This requires diligent work—to build  a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain, to promote the use of better chemical  management processes and safer chemical alternatives, and to innovate through design for smarter  approaches to making our products. Apple continues to lead on smarter chemistry,  pushing for advancements in new materials  that not only can have an impact on human  health and the environment, but also influence  how our industry operates. Our work begins with the substances in our products. By focusing  on safety in our product designs, we strive to protect the people  who design, make, use, and recycle our devices. Through close  engagement with leading members of the scientific community,  NGOs, and industry initiatives, we aim to drive a broader global  shift toward materials that are safer to use and reuse. To do this right means doing more than abiding by regulations  governing harmful substances. It means applying higher  standards and ensuring that those we work with comply  with these standards. We’ve done this with our Regulated  Substances Specification (RSS), which exceeds many regional  regulatory requirements. As we drive innovation—promoting the  development and use of safer materials—we seek to share what  we learn with others in industry. By holding ourselves and our suppliers to these standards,  we create products that are safer across their entire life cycle. Materials with smarter chemistries can be more readily recycled  and reused, enabling our efforts to create circular supply chains  for our products. This impacts not only our design processes,  but also our manufacturing processes—transitioning suppliers  to safer alternatives protects workers and the world we live in. We also recognize that when safe materials are recycled within  circular supply chains, it benefits communities that may otherwise  be exposed to waste. And our work never stops. As we and our  suppliers identify and design new materials and chemistries,  we are committed to taking a leadership role in evaluating and  pursuing safe and sustainable alternatives—and promoting this  progress beyond our supply chain. Mapping and engagement:  Engage our supply chain partners to build  a comprehensive inventory of chemicals  used to make our products and go beyond  regulatory compliance. Innovation:  Exceed regional requirements by innovating  safer alternatives and improving how we and  oursuppliers manage potential risks of chemicals. Assessment:  Assess the potential human health and  environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate  compliance with our requirements and inform  product design. Our commitment to smarter chemistry starts  with a deep understanding of the materials  and chemistries used to make our products. We work closely with our supplier partners to ensure that  they understand and share our goals. This includes improving  the safety of the chemicals we use in both our products and  manufacturing processes. And as our products advance and  suppliers evolve with us, we collect information on the chemical  composition of the new materials our suppliers use. The goal of this work is to ensure the safety of our products  across their life cycle. We set out to understand the impact of  chemicals at each milestone: from the manufacturing process,  to the customer experience, to end-of-life—when materials in  a product are recovered or recycled. This is an area where we are leading. Few electronics  manufacturers have gone to such an extent to understand the  chemical composition of their products. Without this vital data,  they are limited in their ability to address potential toxicological  risks that may be associated with their manufacturing processes  and the products they make. Given the highly sensitive nature  of this information, it’s often hard for those who make these  materials to share with manufacturers further up in the supply  chain. The information we gather—and the process we use— can guide others in our industry to improve the overall safety  of electronic product design and manufacturing. Progress  across our industry matters to us. Only by restricting the use of  potentially harmful chemicals in products can we all safely build  circular economies at scale. The first step in this process is gathering the most detailed  information possible to inform the actions we take. In 2016, we  launched the Full Material Disclosure program to catalog and map  each of the chemicals in our products. Material manufacturers  deep in our supply chain play a critical role, reporting detailed— and often proprietary—data on their material compositions and  manufacturing processes. This greater clarity on the chemical  composition of the materials used in our products empowers  our suppliers and us to make informed choices on materials  selection—and drive change for future products across  our industry. Each supplier is required to report the materials used to  manufacture Apple products. To streamline this requirement,  we’ve created an advanced collection system to capture this  data. Our suppliers reference our library of over 40,000 materials  to provide the most detailed and accurate description of each  material they report—and each material within this library  has been validated against information from the material  manufacturer. If a supplier is using a material not found in  our library, we engage with both the supplier and the material  manufacturer to confirm the material is genuine. In many cases,  we’ll already have information from the manufacturer on the  material’s makeup. In the cases where we do not, our experts  then evaluate the material composition provided by the suppliers  to make sure it aligns with expected properties for that class of  material—an extra step to use the most accurate data possible. Through these efforts we’ve been able to understand the  detailed composition of our final products. We prioritize those  that are key for biocompatibility—we have collected detailed  chemical information for all materials that come under prolonged  skin contact and require qualification from our biocompatibility  team. For iPhone, iPad, and Mac products released in 2020, we  collected detailed chemical information on more than 85 percent,  on average, of product mass. For the 13-inch MacBook Pro  (2020), we collected information on more than 90 percent of  the product by mass. This includes tens of thousands of parts  and assemblies. This process represents a distinct innovation for smarter  chemistry. While there is important work to be done in developing  newer chemistries with reduced potential toxicological risks, there  is also an opportunity that comes with developing a foundation  of knowledge. By creating and maintaining a comprehensive  database with accurate, precise, and current information on  materials, we’re able to inform the entire product life cycle—from  the materials we select, to how we choose to manufacture and,  eventually, recycle and reuse them. This benefits not just our  products, but through driving access to information, contributes  to the safety of the broader electronics industry. Information on how chemicals are used, how  they’re stored, and how employees are protected  is shared with Apple by suppliers through our  Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program. FMD and CSD programs represent our ongoing  efforts to evaluate materials against the strict  requirements of our RSS, inform use of safer  materials in manufacturing processes and  our products, and promote safety within our  supply chain. We prioritize the health and safety of the people who make  our products. Protecting those working within our supply chain  means looking beyond our end products. When selecting  chemicals and supporting better chemical management, we  consider the full experience of the people building our products. Our Code and Standards set clear workplace safety requirements  for our suppliers. Our Chemical Safety Disclosure program advances disclosure  around the chemistries used in manufacturing processes for our  products. We work with participating suppliers to identify how  chemicals are used and stored, as well as what mechanisms  suppliers have in place to protect their employees. This enhanced  access to information allows us to help our suppliers prioritize  chemistries to substitute or manage through enhanced controls  or safety procedures. This effort captures information on process chemicals across our  supply chain. More than 600 facilities have shared their chemical  inventories. This data includes how the chemical is used, stored  and the safety practices each site follows to protect employees. Through this process, we’ve identified 14,000 unique process  chemicals and applications. And by collecting information on  both the chemistries themselves and how they are used, we’re  able to remove chemistries that don’t meet our health and  safety standards. We also identify opportunities to create safer  alternatives—contributing to a safer work environment for the  millions of people who work with our suppliers. The global regulatory and compliance landscape continually  evolves. Our environmental approach, and the science we work  from, mean our requirements may exceed those of local material  safety regulations. When new regulatory benchmarks are put in  place, we work directly with our suppliers to take steps to support  the development of compliant programs at each of our suppliers’  facilities. This process involves direct local-language training  covering Regulated Substance Specification (RSS), our Full  Material Disclosure and Chemical Safety Disclosure programs,  and new compliance standards. For example, in March, China released the national regulation  around Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) as part of its “Blue  Sky Initiative.” We previously had requirements in place governing  VOCs—which often appear in inks, coatings, adhesives, and  cleaners—to track how our suppliers use them and restrict  their use in select applications. With the launch of the new  regulation, we provided additional support with trainings for  more than 2000 supplier participants. And we’ve deployed  a new VOC specification worldwide to help drive adoption of  low-VOC alternatives. Through this specification, we’re signaling  to our suppliers around the world the importance of these  improved alternatives. Our supplier engagement efforts show clear results when new  regulations are passed. The strong foundation of data provided  by our disclosure programs plays a key role. It establishes a clear  understanding of the chemistries across our supply chain that  may be impacted by new regulations. And these efforts support  the safety of our supply chain. With our products, we aim to make the best  chemical and material choices possible to  allow for the protection of human health and  the environment. To evaluate compliance  with our standards—including the RSS— we require our material suppliers to adhere  to specifications that restrict the use of  certain chemicals. Apple subjects the materials in our products to rigorous  evaluation and testing, and our board-certified toxicologists  review these results and the chemical formulation of materials  for safety. The data we collect forms the foundation for key decisions in  the design and manufacturing processes. Our assessment  system helps ensure that only materials that meet our stringent  requirements can be used in Apple products. And by establishing  conservative restrictions on chemicals, testing for substances  of concern, and conducting toxicological evaluations, Apple  prioritizes the safety of our customers and those who make  and recycle our products. Building on our history of advancements in material safety, Apple  published the Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) in  2002, setting standards for the chemicals in our products and  manufacturing processes. To create the RSS, we worked from the  guidance of experts, including toxicologists and dermatologists,  and harmonized with international laws and directives regulating  harmful chemicals—as well as our own policies. The RSS continuously evolves to incorporate the latest scientific  research and is regularly updated with new chemicals and scopes  of restrictions. These changes expand chemical restrictions that,  in many instances, already exceed local regulatory requirements. Most recently, we added a group of acrylate monomers, two   sub-classes of PFAS chemicals, and broadened our restrictions  on VOCs with a dedicated specification. This year, we also  restricted additional process chemicals and expanded the scope  of select existing restrictions. Each RSS update is reviewed  by our Green Chemistry Advisory Board, made up of leading  toxicologists, researchers, and academics. This independent  review helps to ensure that we’re leading the way to protect  our customers and those who make or recycled our products. We pay special attention to the materials that will be in prolonged  skin contact and apply rigorous controls defined in our Restricted  Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list. In particular,  the restrictions focus on avoiding skin reactions most commonly  reported across wearable products, like jewelry. We’ve updated  our list of restricted chemicals to align with leading standards,  recommendations from toxicologists and dermatologists,  international laws and directives, and Apple policies. We vet  supplier compliance, confirming that each material that comes  into prolonged contact with skin is evaluated according to the  latest standards. All of our specifications are incorporated into contractual  obligations for our suppliers, and each helps us maintain our  high standards. Our restrictions on  potentially harmful  chemicals are available  online in the Apple  Regulated Substances  Specification (PDF)   and in Apple’s  Restricted Chemicals  for Prolonged Skin  Contact Materials  (PDF) list. We test materials, parts, and final products to ensure  biocompatibility and compliance with our RSS, so that  our products are safe to make, use, and recycle. We help our suppliers to use safer cleaners and degreasers  in manufacturing, protecting the workers in our supply chain. We collect data from our suppliers to inform how we design  our products and processes to ensure safety and compliance  with our requirements. Apple’s Environmental Testing Lab performs chemical analyses  to evaluate the safety of our products and materials. Our chemists  test materials for safety and monitor compliance with the  specifications. To meet this challenge, the Lab continues to grow,  both in its mission and capacity. As we develop our Full Material  Disclosure and Chemical Safety Disclosure programs, we’re also  expanding our testing facilities with new technologies to conduct  chemical analysis. In addition to the work done at our lab, our  teams review test reports from suppliers to evaluate substances  against the RSS. In fiscal year 2020, we performed toxicological  assessments on 1400 new materials to proactively evaluate  and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products. Each year, we conduct more than 100 chemical assessments on  chemistries before they are used in our manufacturing processes. The data we collect from our disclosure programs drives  our assessments. We’re able to generate comprehensive  assessments, like GreenScreen®, a methodology we use to  gauge the impact of chemicals on individual health and the  environment based on 18 criteria. We also develop toxicological  profiles for new chemicals, using both scientific literature and  internal assessments to determine safe thresholds for use. These  profiles detail the features of each chemical, providing data that  allows us to evaluate the safety of the use of a substance in a  particular product. And, in 2020, we expanded the scope of  biocompatibility testing beyond individual materials to include  modules and whole products. Through toxicological evaluations  of materials within the product, we can assess potential indirect  exposure to substances during use. In A Protocol for  Prioritizing Chemicals  of Concern in the  Electronics Industry  (PDF), we share a  framework to help  actors across industries  systematically evaluate  chemistries. What we learn about the safety of our  materials enables us to make world-changing  products while moving our industry forward  to support the protection of health and  the environment. Our efforts to map and assess the chemicals within our supply  chain ultimately fuel innovations. We use toxicology data at each  point in the product life cycle, from design, to manufacturing,  to end-of-life. This allows us to seek out and develop safer  chemistries that have an impact on each phase—and contribute  to continually improving the overall safety of our products  and processes. The earlier we focus on chemical safety in the product life cycle,  the more options we have along the way to innovate solutions to  improve the substances used. We’re able to approach smarter  chemistry holistically, designing to our customers’ needs, so that  our products are safer for use, reuse, and recycling. Choosing the materials we include in our products is one  important element of this. We utilize our comprehensive  chemical profiles of each material to inform design choices. Our  toxicological assessments look at each chemical within a material,  with a particular focus on those that come into prolonged  contact with skin. As we select the materials to include in our  products, we assess the process chemicals required with each  design choice. We account for the storage and application of  each of these materials, evaluating the exposure to potentially  harmful substances. In 2020, we conducted reviews of more  than 100 process chemicals prior to launch, so we could, where  appropriate, adopt a safer alternative before production started. For example, we worked with a supplier to create a new low-VOC  alternative cleaner that met our requirements. And, finally, we consider what happens when our products  reach their end-of-life. Potentially harmful substances can  have an impact on the recyclability of a material. In some cases,  chemistries that are harmless in small quantities become more  concentrated through recycling cycles. This can lead to down- cycling—use of the material in lower-quality applications—or  
could make the material unsafe for any use. This is true of the  brominated flame retardants (BFRs) that have historically been  used in plastics. The negative environmental effects of these  chemicals outweigh the benefits they offer—and come at the  expense of the recyclability of the material they’re used in. Finding  safer alternative flame retardants to replace BFRs means our  products are both safer to use and more desirable for recycling. By selecting materials with safer chemistries at the outset, we  can improve their recoverability. This not only protects those who  use our products, but also enables the reuse of key materials  like plastic and aluminum. Our efforts to eliminate BFRs from the  plastics we use in our products have improved the recyclability  of our plastic components. And our detailed knowledge of the  makeup of our high-quality aluminum adds to the benefits of  collecting and reusing our aluminum scrap. By keeping potentially  harmful chemicals out of our supply chain at the outset, we can  be confident that the material we recover maintains our quality  and performance standards. Above: Our detailed  knowledge of the makeup of  our high-quality aluminum  adds to the benefits of  collecting and reusing our  aluminum scrap. PVC and phthalates  Replaced with safer thermoplastic elastomers.42  Both are still used by other companies in power  cords and headphone cables. Brominated flame retardants (BFRs)  Eliminated from thousands of parts such as  enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors  in 2008. We use safer metal hydroxides and  phosphorus compounds in their place.42 
Mercury  Eliminated from displays in 2009. We use   energy-efficient, mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs  instead of mercury-based fluorescent lamps in  all our displays. Beryllium   Eliminated from all new product designs. Beryllium  is found in copper alloys used to make connectors  and springs. We’ve made safer materials a priority for our business—and   used our procurement process to encourage our suppliers  to follow suit. Our strict environmental standards governing  potentially harmful substances in our products and processes  have created a market for safer alternatives. And we’re working  with our suppliers to meet this demand, lending the expertise  we’ve developed to create safer chemistries where none exist. We’ve done the critical work of phasing out chemistries that  don’t meet our standards; this next step of innovating smarter  chemistries will change how the industry operates—and help  fulfill our aim of working toward a world we want to live within,   one free of harmful substances. This has required collaboration. We’ve used our extensive  research and analysis of materials to enable our suppliers to find  safer alternatives. In cases where these alternatives have yet to  be created, we lend our technical capabilities in material science  as we work with our suppliers to develop entirely new chemistries. We subject these new alternatives to the same rigorous testing,  evaluating the material against our high performance and  safety standards. These innovations to continually improve chemistries build on   our history of successfully phasing out potentially harmful  chemicals. Since the late 1990s, we have diligently identified  and removed potentially harmful chemicals from our products,  including phthalates, lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others.42  This has required developing alternatives—by creating safer  compounds to replace potentially harmful chemistries or  replacing components with alternatives that meet our safety  standards. In some cases, we’ve redesigned our products to  eliminate the need for parts that incorporate these materials. Our work has received recognition. For the third year in a row,  Apple received an A+ rating from Mind the Store, an external  campaign that evaluates the largest retailers in North America  on how they ensure the chemical safety of their products  and packaging. We are the first consumer  electronics company to  receive the EPA Safer  Choice Partner of the  Year Award for our work  to scale use of safer  cleaners. Our work on smarter chemistry is resource-intensive, from  gathering the information, to assessing the data, to developing  safer alternatives. Our suppliers often don’t have the same  capacity to subject their materials and processes to the level  of due diligence required to assess their safety. For this reason,  we support our suppliers by sharing the safer alternatives we’ve  identified. And by promoting the use of substances that meet  our standards. An area where we are making an immediate impact is the  application of cleaners and degreasers. These substances  account for some of the highest use materials within our supply  chain—and their chemistries have been the focus of considerable  attention from regulators and environmental health and  safety organizations. Rather than reviewing our suppliers’ inventories for potentially  harmful chemistries, we’ve reversed the process—creating  a list of cleaners and degreasers that have been determined  to be safer for use with appropriate controls. We invested in  the in-depth assessment and evaluation of these substances,  incorporating leading guidance by GreenScreen® and the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program. In  2020, we evaluated 54 new cleaners of which 33 passed our  assessment, bringing our total approved alternatives to cleaners  and degreasers to 80. All of our final assembly sites now use  these safer cleaners. We want to make the transition to safer  alternatives accessible to others as well. That’s why we have  partnered with Clean Production Action, an advocacy nonprofit,  to create clear criteria to assess the safety of cleaners in use  across our industry. These efforts have a direct impact—and the potential to change  how our industry operates. More than 80,000 workers within our  supply chain now use safer alternative cleaners and degreasers. In 2020, we were the first consumer electronics company  to receive the EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award  in recognition for our work to scale the use of safer process  chemicals, and protect those working in our supply chain. We’re also partnering with NGOs to make information about these  materials readily available throughout the electronics industry. One effort is ChemFORWARD, a nonprofit collaboration of  brands, retailers, suppliers, and environmental organizations that  share high-quality, actionable chemical hazard data via a globally  harmonized repository. With ChemFORWARD, we’ll share our list  of safe cleaners and degreasers and our evaluation framework  with companies beyond our suppliers and even our industry. We also worked with the Clean Electronics Production Network  (CEPN)—a multi-stakeholder initiative working to address  health and safety challenges in the electronics supply chain— to develop the Process Chemicals Data Collection (PCDC)  Tool. The PCDC Tool is a free, standardized reporting tool that  improves the process of collecting and managing data related  to process chemicals usage in the electronics industry. Among  other benefits, the tool creates an industry-wide format for  consistent collection of information across the supply chain, and  enables identification and quantification of chemical use, to help  drive safer substitutions across the industry. All of the changes  we make today contribute to our goal of protecting the planet  we share.  “Apple demonstrates leadership  not only by using safer alternative  chemistries in its own supply chain,  but also by collaborating to encourage  and facilitate others to do the same. This is a key example of the systems  transformation we see taking place  to enable safer chemical use globally,  across industries.” 
This year, when we updated our Regulated Substances  Specification (RSS), we engaged the group of experts from  our Green Chemistry Advisory Board to review our guidelines  and provide direct feedback. Their input on the RSS was part  of our ongoing engagement with the Board, a community of  toxicologists and researchers Apple convened who share our  vision of developing safer chemistries. We value the insight and  experience of others engaging in the urgent work of keeping  potentially harmful chemicals out of product materials and  manufacturing processes. This cooperation fuels our innovations  around smarter chemistry and developing alternatives to  potentially harmful substances. We’ve also joined with multiple industry initiatives to contribute  to the broader global movement toward safer chemistries. This  includes our engagement with Clean Production Action and now  ChemFORWARD; we engage with both on their efforts around  identifying harmful substances and developing safer alternatives  for the electronics industry. We also helped found and sit on the  board of the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), a  collection of stakeholders working to address complex health and  safety challenges specific to the electronics supply chain. The  Center for Sustainability Solutions at Green America, a leading  environmental advocacy organization, facilitates this network of  civil society organizations, academic researchers, worker rights  advocates, and companies. We’re moving toward an industry-wide response to reducing  potentially harmful substances in our products and processes  to support our goals of ensuring a healthy workplace for those  that make our products and promoting a circular economy. By  eliminating chemicals that would negatively impact the ability for  our products to be recycled and reused, we can achieve this goal. Left: We plan to share the  list of safe cleaners and  degreasers used in our own  supply chain with companies  beyond our industry,  through our partnership  with ChemFORWARD. Environmental Progress Report  65 Introduction       Climate Change       Resources       Smarter Chemistry       Appendix Introduction       Climate Change       Resources       Smarter Chemistry       Appendix 1  Apple is carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2020. Scope 1 emissions have been re-stated for fiscal years 2017-2018 based on improved data sources. 2  Starting in fiscal year 2016, scope 1 emissions capture diesel use in emergency back-up generators and propane gas use in corporate offices. 4  The building operations and cooling emissions (PUE) associated with our colocated data facilities are beyond our operational control and therefore these emissions are not included in our report. 5  In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed above. In fiscal year 2020, these include electricity transmission and distribution losses (72,000 metric tons CO2e) and life cycle emissions  associated with renewable energy (26,000 metric tons CO2e). 6  We are constantly revisiting our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for  classes of service in air travel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions increased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodology change, these emissions would have  increased by 14 percent, which reflects the growth in our business. 7  We adjusted our methodology for fiscal year 2017 to take into account Apple’s “At Home Advisors” program, where employees work remotely. 8  Because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we’re constantly refining our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, we recently obtained more accurate data for the amount  of electricity used to manufacture a number of components like onboard electronics, bare boards and flexes, and various module assemblies. The net result was an increase in our 2019 carbon footprint. When using  the same data and model as 2018, our carbon emissions in 2019 would have been about 23 million metric tons, or a decrease of 7 percent. 9  Due to rounding, our total comprehensive carbon footprint is not always the sum of the subtotals disclosed above. Notes: For data on previous years, please reference past Environmental Progress Reports, available at apple.com/environment. Dash indicates data that are not available. Due to rounding, totals may not be the sum of the subtotals. 1   To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part  measurements of the entire product along with data on part  production. The measurements help us accurately determine  the size and weight of the components and materials in  the product, while data on manufacturing processes and  yield loss during production allows us to account for the  impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories and  packaging, as well as decreased emissions through Apple’s  Supplier Clean Energy Program. When calculating Apple’s  comprehensive carbon footprint, we also include units that  are repaired and replaced through AppleCare. 2   To model customer use, we measure the power consumed  by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a  mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the  purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based  on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and  tvOS devices and three years for iOS, iPadOS and watchOS  devices. Most Apple products last longer and are often  passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner  for others to use. More information on our product energy use  is provided in our Product Environmental Reports. 3   To model transportation, we use data collected on  shipments of single products and multipack units by  land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials  between manufacturing sites; transporting products from  manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting  products from regional distribution hubs to individual  customers; and transporting products from final customers  to recycling facilities. 4   To model end of life, we use material composition data on  our products and estimate the ratio of products that are  sent to recycling or disposal. For products sent to recycling,  we capture the initial processing by the recycler to prepare  the product for recovery of electronic, metal, plastic, and  glass material streams. Subsequent downstream recycling  processes are not included, as these are considered stages  of production and not end-of-life processing. For products  sent to disposal, we capture the emissions associated with  landfilling or incineration of each type of material. 5   After we collect data about manufacturing, use,  transportation, and end of life, we combine it with detailed  greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based  on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average  datasets for material production, manufacturing processes,  electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy  used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently  or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, is also  accounted for within the LCA model. Combining product- specific information with emission data in our LCA allows us  to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions  as they relate to each product. The data and modeling  approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the  Fraunhofer Institute in Germany. There is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due  primarily to data limitations. For the top component contributors  to Apple’s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty  by developing detailed process-based environmental models  with Apple-specific parameters. For the remaining elements  of Apple’s carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data  and assumptions. 2  Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented  by the California Energy Commission. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, corporate facilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. We also recognize that energy use at our employees’ homes likely increased during this period. 3  Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated on a calendar year basis. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated based on the fiscal year. 4  We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis. Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from  renewable energy. 1  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, our boundary expanded to include more than 150 million gallons of water used annually at distribution centers and co-located data centers. Water use has been re-stated for fiscal year  2019 based on improved data sources. 2  We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources. 3  Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for  irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing. 4  Other alternative sources of water include rainwater and recovered condensate that is captured onsite. Water used for construction for activities like dust control is not included in this total, and represents 8 million  gallons of water used in fiscal year 2020. 5  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, we’re including waste from Apple’s distribution centers. Total does not include construction and demolition waste nor electronic waste. We’re refining our methodology for collecting this  data and plan to include it in future years. We have also re-stated the total for 2018 without these categories of waste. 8  Since 2017, all of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple’s Sustainable Fiber Specification. We consider wood fibers to  include bamboo. * Suppliers that have committed to 100 percent renewable energy since publication of the last Program Update in July 2020. To date, 109 suppliers across 24 countries have committed to manufacturing Apple products with 100 percent renewable  energy. For more information, please read our Supplier Clean Energy Program Update. Use of renewable energy at our facilities has  been a central component of our emissions  reduction strategy since 2011. We’ve learned  a lot about how best to secure renewable  energy, which has helped us educate suppliers  and expand our renewable energy efforts into  our supply chain. This appendix summarizes  the types of renewable energy solutions we’ve  deployed, and details how we implement  renewable energy at our data centers—our  largest energy loads. Since launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we  have implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable  energy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most  positive impact. Ownership and PURPA: In 2011, Apple’s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden  solar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company  built its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal  law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to  structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two  more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina  and two micro-hydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark  moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to  an increased use of PURPA in these states. Direct Access: Since 2012, in California and Oregon, we’ve used a program  called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation  offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those  states. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power  producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity. After initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects,  we’re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created:  The Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects deliver renewables  to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project  to our data center, offices, and retail stores in California. Green Rider: In 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. With no  PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly  with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory  structure. The “Nevada Green Rider” enables us to secure a  long-term, fixed-price contract for renewable electricity from  a new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility. We’ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling  320 megawatts. Equity investment: In 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in  Sichuan, China, to support all of our in-country retail stores,  corporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project  represented the first time a commercial company created a  new large-scale project in China for its own use. We’ve since  replicated this model many times for Apple’s supply chain. Portfolio solutions: In 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in  Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops  in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in  each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures:  We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase  agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows. Renewable microgrid: Since 2017, we’ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent  renewable energy—about 75 percent of which is generated  onsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation  comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts  of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is  drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project  in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery  storage manages the renewable energy generation and the  building’s energy use; optimizes demand management, load  shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures  uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages. To reach 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple’s own  facilities, Apple has helped to create 1524 MW of renewable  energy around the world, with another 32 MW in development  (contracted)—for a total of 1557 megawatts. The projects  listed to the right represent Apple-created renewable energy  projects supporting Apple facilities’ electricity use and  contributing to cleaner grids around the world. Operational  projects apply a mix of clean energy technology including wind  (21.6 percent), solar (77.2 percent), micro-hydro (0.22 percent),  and biogas fuel cells (0.92 percent). Dash indicates data are not tracked. N/A = Gas use at colocation facilities are considered outside of Apple’s operational control. 1   We’ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple’s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we’ve removed electricity use associated  with colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy. The chart below provides a detailed breakdown of fiscal year 2020 energy use,   which we used to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions. We used over 1.7 billion kWh of electricity in fiscal year 2020 to  power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world. We’re proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean,  renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and  low-impact hydro power. To cover our needs, we build our own  renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean  energy from locally obtained resources. Between 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of  Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an  18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. We then partnered with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help  build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were  Duke Energy’s first Green Source Rider projects to become  operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to  develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple  and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable  energy projects. The five Green Source Rider projects have a  combined capacity of 22 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term  commitments to five more solar projects  
We now operate six data centers, and more are being developed. These data centers are spread across North America, Europe,  and Asia. Each has unique design features that conserve energy  and reflect the climate, as well as other aspects, of its location. in North Carolina, for an additional 85 megawatts of clean energy. In fiscal year 2020, the Maiden data center was supported by  projects that generated 358 million kWh of renewable energy,  which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 27,000 homes in  North Carolina for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to  avoid over 97,000 metric tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.2 
Energy efficiency measures we’ve implemented at our Maiden  data centers include use of outside air cooling through a  waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours,  which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle  75 percent of the time. 2  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions. Carbon emissions  equivalences are calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf. To support our Prineville data center, we signed a 200-megawatt  power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the  Montague Wind Power Facility, which entered commercial  operation at the end of 2019. It’s our largest project to date,  producing over 562 million kWh of clean, renewable energy  a year. This is in addition to our power purchase agreement for the  56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few  miles from our data center. This solar PV project, which came  online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces  141 million kWh of renewable energy per year. To strengthen the  connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon’s  Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from  these projects directly to our data center. Also supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that  harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals  that have been operating for over 60 years. These micro-hydro  projects generate up to 7 to 10 million kWh of renewable energy  a year. To supplement these projects, we executed a long-term  purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a  69-megawatt portfolio of eight solar projects in Oregon. In fiscal year 2020, the Prineville data center was supported by  projects that generated 279 million kWh of renewable energy,  which is equivalent to the energy used by over 25,000 homes in  Oregon for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid  over 197,000 metric tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.3  
Our Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry  climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible. Indirect evaporative cooling is enabled when the outside air  temperature gets too high to cool the servers with outside  air alone. 3  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions. Carbon  emissions equivalences are calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a. pdf. Unlike competitive energy markets where we’ve located some  of our data centers, the regulated electricity supply in Nevada  did not offer a simple solution for us to create new renewable  energy projects dedicated to our data center. So, in 2013, we  created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop  the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and  constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs  all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The Fort  Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved  mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The 20-megawatt array has an  annual production capacity of over 43 million kWh. To facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple  worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to  create a green energy option open to all commercial customers,  called the Nevada Green Rider, that does not require the  customer to fund project development up-front. Thanks to this  new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar  project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project  came online in 2017, producing about 137 million kWh of  renewable energy per year. We have used the Nevada Green  Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren Solar  II project. Apple’s largest solar project to date, it is estimated  to produce over 540 million kWh per year and came online in  late 2019. Next was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, which  came online in late 2020. The project is estimated to produce  110 million kWh of renewable energy per year. In fiscal year 2020,  the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated  345 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the  energy used by nearly 32,000 homes in Nevada for a year. Use of  renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 125,000 metric  tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.4 
Like in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the  mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever  possible. When the outside air is too warm to cool the servers  alone, it draws from indirect evaporative cooling. 4  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions. Carbon emissions  equivalences are calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf. In 2017, Apple’s 130-megawatt California Flats solar project in  nearby Monterey County came online, and now we use Direct  Access to supply power from that project directly to our data  center as well as other Apple facilities in California. In fiscal year 2020, the Newark data center was supported by  projects that generated 99 million kWh of renewable energy,  which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 15,000 homes   in California for a year. Use of renewable energy allowed us to  avoid more than 7,000 metric tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.5 
Our data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent  renewable energy. We hit this milestone in January 2013, when  we began serving the data center with energy sourced primarily  from California wind power. 5  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions. Carbon emissions  equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf. Our global command data center in Mesa, Arizona, came online in  2016. To support this facility, we partnered with the local utility, the  Salt River Project (SRP), to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke  solar project, which became operational in December 2016. This project produces over 148 million kWh of clean, renewable  energy a year, which roughly matches the energy used by the  data center. As the Mesa data center grew, it became apparent that we  needed additional sources of renewable energy to maintain our  100 percent renewable electricity goal. We began to explore onsite solar options at the data center and  determined that we could provide valuable shaded parking that  paid for itself through energy bill reductions while adding to our  renewable energy portfolio. The resulting PV facility includes five  elevated parking canopies and three ground mounted arrays, for  a total generating capacity of 4.67 MW. The onsite PV system  began commercial operation in February 2019 and is expected to  generate 9,000 MWh per year. In addition, we began working with SRP to develop a customer  renewable energy program in 2017, resulting in their Sustainable  Energy Initiative, launched in 2019, to provide a diverse mix of  commercial electric customers with new renewable energy at  an affordable price. Under this program, Apple has executed an  agreement with SRP to purchase a portion of the output of their  proposed 100 MW Central Line PV Facility, expected to begin  operations in 2022. In fiscal year 2020, the Mesa data center was supported by  227 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the  energy used by over 18,000 Arizona homes. Use of renewable  energy allowed us to avoid more than 107,000 metric tons of  CO₂e during the fiscal year.7 
6  Apple took operational control of the building in October 2015 and converted it to a data center that began servicing customers in March 2017:   www.srpnet.com/about/stations/pdfx/2018irp.pdf. 7  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions. Carbon  emissions equivalences are calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a. pdf. Our data center came online in 2020. The data center’s  construction phase was powered with 100 percent wind energy  from a local renewable energy retailer in Denmark. Our Northern  Jutland PV project achieved commercial operation in late 2019,  will meet all of the data center’s near-term energy needs, and at  42 megawatts, is one of Denmark’s largest solar power plants. Our second renewable project in Denmark, a 17 MW wind project,  also came online in late 2020. We have secured long-term supply  contracts with both Danish renewable projects, which will scale  up as our data center loads grow. The power system design at the data center is based on a  resilient substation that eliminates the need for backup diesel  generators. This reduces the carbon footprint of the data center  and completely eliminates the need for large diesel fuel storage  systems and diesel engine emissions that would impact the  local community. In fiscal year 2020, the Denmark data center sourced   13 million kWh of renewable energy, avoiding more than  5,000 metric tons of CO₂e. We have two new data centers in development in China, one in  Guizhou Province, the other in Inner Mongolia. Both data centers  are scheduled to come online in 2021, and we have lined up  renewable projects in China to supply the data centers with 100  percent renewable energy. Data centers often rely on diesel-powered emergency generators  to provide a backup source of power in case of electrical outages. Emergency generators must be exercised periodically to ensure  their operational reliability. These preventative maintenance  activities as well as emergency operations during power outages  consume diesel fuel and result in air pollutant emissions. As a  source of air pollutant emissions, the emergency generators at  Apple’s data centers are operated under air permits issued by  regulatory agencies. These permits require monitoring, testing,  inspection, and reporting at regular intervals. We’ve voluntarily installed emissions control systems on  our emergency generators to reduce emissions of nitrogen  oxides and particulates. And we’re standardizing our approach  to preventative maintenance activities to minimize annual  testing hours. To further reduce air emissions at our data centers, we’re  finding innovative ways to minimize the use of diesel-powered  emergency generators. In Denmark, we’ve deployed a new  substation design, in conjunction with the local utility, with the  highest level of resiliency and automation. It will allow Apple  to eliminate emergency generators altogether—in addition to  eliminating air emissions associated with diesel fuel delivery. At  our data centers in Nevada, North Carolina, and Oregon, we have  added a second transmission line, which increases the reliability  of the power supply and, therefore, minimizes the need for  emergency operation of the generators. The majority of our online services are provided by our own data  centers; however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for  additional data center capacity. While we don’t own these shared  facilities and use only a portion of their total capacity, we include  our portion of their energy use in our renewable energy goals. Starting January 2018, 100 percent of our power for colocation  facilities was matched with renewable energy generated within  the same state or NERC region for facilities in the United States,  or within the same country or regional grid for those around the  world. As our loads grow over time, we’ll continue working with  our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy  use with renewables. Furthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of  colocation services to help it develop the capability to provide  renewable energy solutions to its customers. This partnership  advances Apple’s renewable energy program and those of other  companies that use this colocation provider. Beyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities,  we also use third-party services to support some of our on- demand cloud computing and storage services. We are requiring  these suppliers to adopt a 100 percent renewable energy strategy  for their Apple energy use, and we continue to work with our  suppliers to refine estimates for the carbon emissions associated  with their services. 8   We calculate “default utility emissions” to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy. This allows us to  demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program. 9   Apple’s greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions. 10  We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar year basis, while the numbers reported in this table are based on fiscal year. Beginning  
11   Over the past few years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we started reporting this submetered  electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We’ve updated our fiscal year  2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple’s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we’ve removed from our electricity usage  and scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations. Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s comprehensive fiber footprint data related to corporate  fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations in fiscal year 2020. This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting  product and packaging related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the  calculated corporate annual fiber footprint of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2020  and of corporate and retail operations in the same period. As there is no standardised method available for calculating a product or company fiber  footprint Apple defined a methodology for internal use. The scope of the Fiber Footprint  includes Apple’s corporate fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations. The  fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood, bamboo, and bagasse fiber, both virgin  and recycled, that Apple uses in packaging, and other paper products. Apple obtains and  analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and sums up these figures for the  entire company using sell-in numbers. For some products, a representative supplier is  chosen to calculate the product-specifc packaging. The output is a total fiber footprint.  The system boundaries are clearly defined   Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate   Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately  disclosed  Calculation methodology for the corporate fiber footprint   Sales data for FY2020, including accessories   Aggregated fiber data for all products and the total corporate fiber footprint for  the fiscal year 2020  
The methodology paper (Fiber Footprint at Apple - Methodology Description - V1.1)  provided by Apple and reviewed in 2017, is considered a sound and appropriate guidance  for determining the company fiber footprint. Where appropriate, this approach follows  methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments. This review comprises a check of packaging fiber data for selected products (iPhone 11,  iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad 2019). Plausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. No  corrections were needed. This review was done remotely. All questions raised in the course  of the review were answered by Apple. Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate  fiber footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of fiber data and  information. - Marina Proske -    - Karsten Schischke -  Fraunhofer IZM    Fraunhofer IZM  Dept.

Trevor A. Donaghu, Lead Assuror   John Rohde, Technical Reviewer  Program Manager  Practice Lead  Sustainability and Climate Change Services  Sustainability and Climate Change Services Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s scope 3 carbon footprint data related to the products  manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. in fiscal year 2020. This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting  product related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the calculated  comprehensive annual carbon footprint comprised of emissions derived from the life cycle  assessment (LCA) of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2020. This review and verification  focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by  WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol – Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). It is  noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1  and 2 emissions) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a  separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this  statement. Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded  from the scope of this verification. This review and verification covers Apple’s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not  replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions  (GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been  calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management –  Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This  review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases – Part 3:  Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions. These criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product  emissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (98%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon footprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products. The aforementioned  criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to  providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and  refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc. Including a reported value of 0.33 million metric tons CO2e for facilities (out of scope of  this verification), total comprehensive carbon footprint is reported to be 22.59 million  metric tons CO2e. Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint includes an increasing amount of greenhouse gas  emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects,  supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations. These reductions are part of Apple’s Clean Energy Program. Fraunhofer IZM has not  verified these emissions reductions. Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse  Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint  
 is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and  information, and  
 has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on  GHG quantification, monitoring and reporting. A verification and sampling plan as required by ISO 14046-3 has been established for the  comprehensive carbon footprint review and verification, defining the level of assurance,  objectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification.  Sales data for FY2020, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple's  extended warranty and technical support plans for their devices. o  The breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cycle phases  manufacturing, transportation, product use and recycling  
The data and information supporting the GHG assertion were projected (use phase and  recycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2020 data regarding sales figures, manufacturing,  transportation, use patterns where available). This review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall  carbon footprint. The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:  
 Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of  methodological changes as indicated by Apple? In FY2020 and beginning of FY2021 4 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed  successfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments iPhone, MacBook  Pro, iMac, and Apple Watch. These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which  represent in total 9.7% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. Representatives of other  product segments (iPad, iPod, Mac Pro, MacBook Air, HomePod, AirPort Express / AirPort  Extreme, Apple TV, Airpods and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design  changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years. All  reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 74.5% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related  evidence was provided where needed. Apple’s assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation  data. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from  Apple’s suppliers. For all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst- case approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative  estimates. The review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data  level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent  analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice. - Karsten Schischke -   - Marina Proske -  Fraunhofer IZM    Fraunhofer IZM  Dept. Environmental and  Dept.

To provide feedback on this report, please contact environment-report@apple.com. Reporting year: All references to year throughout the report refer to the calendar year unless fiscal year is specified. Recycled materials: Recycling makes better use of finite resources by sourcing from recovered rather than mined materials. We ask our suppliers to have recycled content  verified by an independent third party to a standard that conforms to ISO 14021. Bio-based plastics: Bio-based plastics are made from biological sources rather than from fossil-fuel sources. Bio-based plastics allow us to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Renewable materials: We define bio-materials as those that can be regenerated in a human lifespan, like paper fibers or sugarcane. Bio-materials can help us use fewer finite  resources. But even though bio-materials have the ability to regrow, they are not always managed responsibly. Renewable materials are a type of bio-material managed in a way  that enables continuous production without depleting earth’s resources. That’s why we focus on sources that are certified for their management practices. 1  The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) recently validated Apple’s emissions reduction target: 61.7 percent by 2030 relative to our 2019 emissions. This SBTi-approved target  is derived from our current target—to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030—only with a 2019 base year, instead of 2015. 2  U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator: www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator. 3  Natural gas use has been re-stated for fiscal years 2017–2019 based on corrected billing data. 4  Mac mini (2018) was used for comparison as the most recently released and similar device.

standard specific to data centers. This standard specifically addresses mechanical and electrical system efficiencies within a data center, and uses two metrics: mechanical load  component (MLC) and electrical load component (ELC). For more information visit: ashrae.org. 13 Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not  
included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. We also recognize that energy use at our employees’ homes likely increased during this period. 14 Annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon compared to fiscal year 2019 metrics. In previous environmental progress reports, this metric was reported based on calendar  
year data. 15 Our GHG reporting requirement applies to all suppliers under our Code of Conduct. 16 The Impact Accelerator is a capacity-building program for companies that are at least 51 percent owned, operated, and controlled by an African American, Hispanic American/ 
LatinX, or Indigenous American individual. 17 This includes all direct electricity use within our scope 2 boundary. 18 Includes all devices collected by Apple for refurbishing during fiscal year 2020. 19 As of December 2020, all established final assembly supplier sites—or those that have been Apple suppliers for more than one year—for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch,  
AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats are third-party certified as Zero Waste by UL LLC (UL 2799 Standard). UL requires at least 90 percent diversion through methods other  than waste to energy to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (Silver 90–94 percent, Gold 95–99 percent, and Platinum 100 percent) designations. 20 This recycled content has been verified by an independent third party to a recycled content standard that conforms to ISO 14021. 21 Recycling makes better use of finite resources by sourcing from recovered rather than mined materials. We ask our suppliers to have recycled content verified by an independent  
third party to a standard that conforms to ISO 14021. 22 We define bio-materials as those that can be regenerated in a human lifespan, like paper fibers or sugarcane. Bio-materials can help us use fewer finite resources. But even  
though bio-materials have the ability to regrow, they are not always managed responsibly. Renewable materials are a type of bio-material managed in a way that enables  continuous production without depleting earth’s resources. That’s why we focus on sources that are certified for their management practices. 23 Made from 100 percent recycled materials, the 16,000 polyester yarn filaments in each band are interwoven with thin silicone threads using advanced braiding machinery. 24 Rare earth elements in the magnets can represent about 2–4 percent of the mass of the Taptic Engine, and tungsten represents about 40–63 percent. 25 Made from 100 percent recycled materials, the 16,000 polyester yarn filaments in each band are interwoven with thin silicone threads using advanced braiding machinery. 26 Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple’s Sustainable Fiber Specification (PDF). We consider wood fibers to include bamboo. 27 Based on expected equivalent fiber production from our forestry projects and virgin fiber used for Apple product packaging. To determine the output of Apple’s projects, we  
work with our partners to understand the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or maintain certification limit harvest  volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests. 28 Claim based on iPhone 12 Ceramic Shield front compared with previous-generation iPhone. 29 iPhone 12 is splash, water, and dust resistant and was tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters  
up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet  iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty. 30 Refurbished products are not available in all countries. 31 The Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute receives funding from Apple as part of this recycling technology initiative. 32 We define high risk as those areas with high or extremely high overall water risk based on the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool. 33 This total includes freshwater use as well as alternative water sources including recycled water, rainwater, and recovered condensate. We define freshwater as drinking-water  
quality, the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources. Recycled water represents a key alternative  water source. Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for  irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing. Other alternative sources of freshwater include rainwater and recovered condensate that is captured onsite. Water used  for construction for activities like dust control is not included in this total, and represents 8 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2020. Our actual water discharge may vary  by 10 percent relative to our estimates. In these estimates, we’ve taken into account consumptive activities including irrigation and cooling towers. 34 These savings do not include reduction in water use from facility closures and reduced occupancy due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We consider those savings temporary and  
also acknowledge that the water use was transferred to employees’ homes. 35 We calculate water discharge based on known evaporation, from activities like cooling and irrigation. For sites where these evaporative activities are not present we estimate  
that water withdrawn is returned to municipal systems. We estimate our margin of error to be approximately 10 percent, and will continue to update our model with new sources  of data. 36 Diversion rates do not include construction and demolition waste or electronic waste for fiscal year 2020. Electronic waste is accounted for in the total metric tons of electronic  
waste we sent to recycling found on page 45. 37 Our Prineville facility is third-party certified as Zero Waste by USGBC TRUE. TRUE requires 90 percent diversion or higher from the landfill without the use of waste-to-energy  
to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill. 38 Total does not include construction and demolition waste nor electronic waste for fiscal year 2020. 39 This waste-to-energy option is not yet available to sites in Alaska and Hawaii. 40 All established final assembly supplier sites—or those that have been Apple suppliers for more than one year—for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple

We make brands and products that people love,  while building a more sustainable future for   our business and for the planet. We do all of this  while staying true to our purpose: to refresh   the world and make a difference. Our people worked with great dedication in 2021 to help our  company emerge stronger from the pandemic and position ourselves  for continued growth in 2022 and beyond. We made important  decisions about streamlining our brand portfolio; changing the  way we work as an organization; and tailoring our investments to  target the most promising products and priorities. Through all of  the challenges, initiatives and successes of 2021, our environmental,  social and governance priorities continued to be embedded in our  business and the way we work. Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities are  integrated into our strategy. We’re focused on areas where we can  have a measurable, positive impact on the communities we serve  around the world. Our ESG initiatives are interconnected, and so are the solutions  we support. We seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering  collective action: partnering across industry, government and society  to address shared challenges. Water is a top business priority. It is the principal ingredient in the  products we make and is critical for the agricultural products we  use. Through the 2030 Water Security Strategy we announced in  2021, we’re focused on achieving water security where the company  operates and sources ingredients, concentrating on water-stressed  areas—while maintaining 100% replenishment globally. In 2021, we returned 167% of the water used in our finished   beverages to nature and communities. Since 2010, our water,  sanitation and hygiene programs have reached more than   18.5 million people globally. We also continue to make meaningful progress on our World Without  Waste packaging initiative. We’re continuing to invest in partnerships  with innovators and NGOs like our PlantBottle™ partners, World  Wildlife Fund and The Ocean Cleanup. We’ve also set new targets,  including a virgin plastic reduction goal and an industry-leading goal  to significantly boost our use of reusable packaging. By 2030, the company aims to have at least 25% of volume globally  across our portfolio of brands sold in refillable/returnable glass or  plastic bottles, or in refillable containers through traditional fountain  or Coca-Cola Freestyle dispensers. We believe that increasing the  Coca-Cola system’s usage of refillable/returnable containers creates  value for customers and consumers, drives increased package  collection and simultaneously reduces our carbon footprint. Water risks and packaging waste are closely linked to climate  change. We’re reducing our carbon footprint through an intertwined  and holistic approach across our ESG priorities. Our vision is for  packaging to be reused and recycled as part of a circular economy— which means a world with dramatically lower carbon emissions   and climate impacts. Combating the climate crisis requires a global effort, which is why  we worked with experts to set science-based targets. In 2021, we  announced that we made solid progress to decarbonize our system  by achieving our “drink in your hand” goal. We’ve increased our  ambitions through our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target to  reduce absolute emissions by 25%, and our long-term ambition is   to be net zero carbon by 2050. In 2021, we took action to create a better shared future through  investments in economic empowerment; diversity, equity and  inclusion (DEI); and giving through The Coca-Cola Foundation. We’ve  refreshed the company’s global DEI strategy to reflect the need  for greater global reach, broader impact and a focus on equity and  economic empowerment. Throughout our company’s rich, 136-year  history, we’ve seen many changes and  overcome times of uncertainty. Our  system’s strength and resilience have  helped us adapt while remaining true to  our purpose: to refresh the world and  make a difference. “ Together, we’re using our global presence  to build a more sustainable future for   our business and the planet while staying  laser-focused on growth. In 2021, our  networked way of working drove strong  results, and I’m proud of what we’ve  achieved.” 
We aspire for our workforce to mirror the markets we serve. In 2021,  we set a 2030 aspiration to mirror U.S. census data for race and  ethnicity at all job levels of our company in the United States. We also  recommitted to our aspiration to be 50% led by women globally, with  a target of 2030. In 2021, The Coca-Cola Foundation continued to support communities’  response to the pandemic with the creation of a $20 million fund to  help stop the spread of COVID-19. Alongside our Project Last Mile  partners, we have used our supply chain, distribution and marketing  expertise to support vaccine rollout in a number of African markets,  as well as leveraging our network of cold-chain partners. We measure success by the value we create for shareowners while  also creating a better shared future for people, communities and the  planet. We’re using data to measure and drive this success. Going  forward, our ESG goals are a factor in our compensation program  for top executives. You can read more details in our Governance &  Management section. We are a total beverage company, and our focus is on creating a  portfolio of great-tasting drinks and loved brands with the greatest  potential to attract more consumers. During the pandemic, we  evaluated our entire portfolio and tailored our investments. Today,   we are focusing on approximately 200 master brands. We’ve increased our innovation efforts, including sparkling and  plant-based beverages as well as new entries in flavored alcohol  beverages. Our efforts are designed for long-term success—we’re  balancing big bets with intelligent experimentation, learning from  failures and scaling successes. •   We expanded some of our strongest brands to more markets, such  as Coke® with Coffee, fairlife®, AHA® and Topo Chico® Hard Seltzer. fairlife® is now a $1 billion brand with seven consecutive years of  double-digit volume growth. •   We rolled out a new and improved formulation of Coca-Cola® Zero  Sugar, which helped the brand grow volume by double digits in  2021. The new formula has driven accelerated growth in 80% of the  markets where it was launched. •   We acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in  BODYARMOR, giving us a line of sports performance and hydration  beverages with significant potential for long-term growth. Our backbone is a global system of strong partnerships with  approximately 225 bottlers supported by leading edge technology. In 2021, we worked together to build a networked global  organization, combining the power of scale with the deep knowledge  
and cross-functional collaboration required to win locally. Together,  we’re focusing on what we do best—building brands and products  that people love and enjoy, and growing markets for those brands. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our company and system employees make this possible every day. Together, we’re using our global presence to build a more sustainable  future for our business and the planet while staying laser-focused   on growth. In 2021, our networked way of working drove strong  results, and I’m proud of what we’ve achieved. I’m confident we   will accomplish even more in 2022. “The Coca-Cola Company is staying focused on what matters most:   its people and purpose. Although 2021 brought continued change across  the world, our Board of Directors is proud of how the company remained  centered on its key priorities and navigated many challenges to emerge  stronger. This strong performance heading into 2022 is indicative of   the company’s resilience, laying the groundwork for continued success   and growth.”

Our publicly reported  sustainability goals drive us to  continually improve, working  in concert with The Coca-Cola  Company’s approximately 225  bottling partners in more than  200 countries and territories. Our 2030 Water Security Strategy  focuses on increasing water security  through a context-based approach to  water replenishment, advocacy for smart  water policies and responsible water  use across our operations and supply  chain. We’re using the size and scale of  our company to improve water security  where water risks impact our business,  supply chain and communities. Our strategy is underpinned by global  goals and specific context-based targets  that will enable us to measure our  progress toward reaching our vision. Our  global goals for 2030 fall under three  pillars—Our Operations, Our Communities  and Our Watersheds—with one additional  cross-cutting goal: maintaining at least  100% global replenishment of the water  used in our finished beverages. In 2020 and 2021, we analyzed  water-related risks to identify priority  operating facilities. We are mapping  priority ingredient sourcing regions  and watersheds according to highest  exposure to water stress. We are also  mapping priority communities based on  local context to identify opportunities for  action to strengthen communities’ access  to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)  and their resilience to climate change. By mapping and overlaying all three of  these categories (operations, watersheds  and communities), we will identify  overlaps and interconnectivity across  our action areas to develop a holistic,  integrated and context-based approach.

In 2021, average sugar per 100 ml declined while  global volume grew. In 2020, both average sugar  per 100 ml and volume declined, primarily due to  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1   Peer-reviewed methodologies were used  to calculate volumetric benefits per project  and operating unit; calculated benefits per  project and operating unit using peer-reviewed  methodologies; all replenish data are internally  validated and verified; the equivalent volume  for 100% Replenish rate (175 Billion Liters; BL)  is externally assured; Benefits fall into  three categories: Watershed Protection and  Restoration (229.1 BL), Water for Productive  Use (47.5 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation  (16.7 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and  acquisition activities between 2019 - 2021,  certain brands may not be accounted for in this  metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report  finished beverages is based on global sales  volume. For more than a century, our company  has been known for our refreshing  beverages. Over the decades, we’ve  continued to evolve, and today we  offer a lineup of beverages across five  categories, providing consumers with a  wealth of choices across a wider range  of categories—including drinks with  less added sugar and beverages with  enhanced nutrition benefits. We have  streamlined our lineup, focusing on  brands with the greatest potential to  scale and grow. We continue to prioritize added sugar  reduction. We have adjusted recipes to  reduce added sugar, promote low- and  
Investment in sweetener research and  sugar alternatives is important, especially  for those alternatives that can provide  low- and no-calorie beverage options. We have invested more than $100 million  in sweetener innovation and sugar  reduction research since 2008, while the  industry as a whole has invested over   $1 billion during the same time period.

Our World Without Waste initiative is anchored by three  fundamental goals: Making 100% of our packaging  recyclable globally by 2025—and using at least 50%  recycled material in our packaging by 2030 (Design);  collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one we  sell by 2030 (Collect); and bringing people together to  support a healthy, debris-free environment (Partner). Tackling the global plastic waste crisis requires cross- sector collaboration and alignment on common  principles and targets, and we’re working with a range  of stakeholders at a global, regional and local level to  achieve our goals. We have a responsibility to reduce the carbon footprint  of our value chain; to improve business resilience by  managing the short- and long-term risks and impacts of  a changing climate; and to foster partnerships that drive  positive change. Our approach to addressing climate change has  accelerated in recent years in keeping with the scale  and urgency of the issue. Even as we achieved our 2020  “drink in your hand” goal to reduce our relative carbon  emissions by 25% against a 2010 baseline, we increased  our climate ambition. We’ve announced both our science-based target to  reduce absolute emissions by 25% by 2030 against a  2015 baseline and an ambition to be net zero carbon by  2050. Several of our bottling partners have announced  their own science-based targets and net zero pledges,  which will help drive even more climate action across the  Coca-Cola system. In line with our net zero ambition, we conducted  preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to  define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero  transition to 2050. By 2030, we aim to have at   least 25% of our beverages  worldwide by volume sold in  refillable/returnable glass or  plastic bottles or in fountain  dispensers with reusable  packaging

4  We recently implemented a new data system for collecting  sustainability metrics and continually work toward ensuring that our  practices are industry-leading. In 2021, we took significant steps to  help facilitate complete and accurate progress reporting against our  science-based target. We updated our GHG emissions accounting  methodology for the Coca-Cola system aligned with the GHG  Protocol and undertook an assessment to evaluate and expand the  emissions sources included within our reporting boundary to align  with requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In  2022, we plan to track our target progress in real-time across the  system, putting us in a strong position to publicly report on progress  against our target next year. 3   The collection rates represent average collection rates for  select primary consumer packaging, which is the percentage  of our packaging that was collected for recycling (or refill).

We rely on agricultural ingredients to make and  package our beverages. Ensuring these ingredients  are sustainably sourced is a key priority for us,  essential to our efforts on climate resilience, water  security, human rights, sustainable packaging and  economic empowerment. As climate change leads  to more extreme weather and increased water  stress, more sustainable agricultural practices will  play a vital role in promoting resilience across our  supply chain and in the communities that produce  our agricultural ingredients. We track progress against our sustainable sourcing  goal for 12 global priority ingredients: cane sugar,  mango, grape, orange, apple, corn, lemon, beet  sugar, tea, pulp and paper, coffee and soybean. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA)  advance and standardize our core values at   the farm level—from small-scale farmer  cooperatives  to large commercial operations— supporting livelihoods and helping to ensure  continuity of supply. Introduced in 2021 to improve  upon our previous Sustainable Agriculture Guiding  Principles (SAGP), the PSA aim to strengthen   our progress toward sustainable sourcing of  agricultural ingredients. We are currently in the process of mapping   the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients   we procure against the PSA framework. The Coca-Cola Company’s policies and practices   are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights, which we have  supported since their inception in 2011. We work   to embed respect for human rights across our  system through a comprehensive framework of  policies, stakeholder engagement, due diligence  and remediation. We maintain an industry-leading global audit  program of our own operations, as well as those   of our bottling partners and Tier 1 suppliers,   with over 38,000 human rights assessments  conducted since 2003. As of the end of 2021,   95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers  and 92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our  rigorous Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) protocols. These audit results are reviewed by the ESG and  Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors  on an annual basis. Despite falling short of our ambitious goals due  to the impact of COVID-19, these results show  remarkable improvement across our value chain. We will continue to advance our human rights  strategy and work. 1   Data is based on supplier reporting according to our requirements, which is consolidated and internally validated. Results can  fluctuate due to changes in volumes and sourcing origins while we get new suppliers on board with our requirements. 2  This bar graph shows progress towards total sustainable sourcing of all 12 global priority ingredients, combined, using third- party validation programs approved under our PSA, effective 2021, alongside progress against our previous SAGP, effective  2013-2020. The company is working to finalize our benchmarking of third-party validation against the PSA standard, including  verifications accepted under the SAGP but for which benchmarking continues in 2022.

Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance We’ve established a portfolio of drinks that are best positioned to   grow in a fast-changing marketplace. As part of our networked, global  organization, we are continuing to curate and innovate a tailored   collection of global, regional and local brands that are organized within   the following five categories. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance The consumer remains at the heart of everything we   do as we provide drinks for every occasion. New innovations,  such as the products shown here, are designed with  scalability in mind to have staying power across markets  and to support our growth. In Europe in 2021, we brought back  our “What The Fanta” campaign for  a second year, featuring a “mystery”  blue, zero-sugar flavor. To find out  the flavor, customers could scan the  QR code on-pack to unlock a series  of online clues. The previous year,  a campaign for a ""mystery"" green  flavor drove five times the rate of  sales as traditional Fanta Orange  during the same period. Our newly reformulated recipe for  Coca-Cola Zero Sugar provides a  more refreshing and delicious taste  with no changes to ingredients or  nutritional values. The new recipe   hit store shelves in the United States  and Canada in the summer of 2021. 
fairlife Nutrition Plan is an ultra- filtered milk nutrition shake with   30 grams of high-quality protein,   2 grams of sugar and 150 calories. In 2022, fairlife announced that   it surpassed $1 billion in annual   retail sales. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer blends  sparkling water and natural flavors  and is inspired by Topo Chico  sparkling mineral water’s 125-year  heritage and growing popularity as  a craft cocktail mixer. Four flavors— Tangy Lemon Lime, Exotic Pineapple,  Strawberry Guava and Tropical  Mango—are offered in variety packs,  and select flavors are offered in  single-serve slim cans. In 2021, we acquired full ownership  of BODYARMOR, a line of sports  performance and hydration  beverages that has significant  potential for long-term growth. In 2021, BODYARMOR launched  BODYARMOR Edge, which combines  the hydration of a sports drink with a  boost of natural caffeine. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance In 26 European markets, we ran our #neversettle  campaign, which focused on our company’s work  around waste reduction, water stewardship and  youth unemployment. The series of films, social  media posts and advertisements shared how we  are helping to solve some of the world’s most  urgent challenges. In Belgium and The  Netherlands, we launched  the “Help Us Recycle”  campaign, designed  to raise awareness of  recycling and motivate  consumers to pitch in. Consumers play an important role   in achieving a circular economy. To support the launch of our new  100% rPET bottles (excluding caps   and labels) in the United States,   we ran the ""Recycle Me Again""  campaign. Each bottle included a  prominent message urging people   to help give the bottles another   life—again and again. We want to make it as easy as possible for  people to do their part to turn the tide on  plastic waste. In Australia, we teamed up with  Planet Ark during National Recycling Week  to help educate consumers on recycling— including what to recycle, how to recycle and  where to recycle. We believe our company’s ESG  goals and progress can make  a difference for our business,  communities and the planet. We also know we can’t achieve  these goals alone. To encourage collective action, we’re raising awareness  and communicating the importance of recycling, water  stewardship and other ESG priorities through our brands  and company communications channels. In South Korea, we  launched the nation’s  first label-less sparkling  water product, Seagram’s,  where the product name  and logo are engraved  on the bottle itself. By  removing the label, it  helps make it easier to  recycle the bottle. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance At The Coca-Cola Company, our business principles  and practices are designed to foster an innovative and  collaborative culture—a culture that is committed to  ethical behavior, accountability and transparency. The  company’s Board of Directors has established several  committees to assist in discharging its governance  duties. These are an Audit Committee, a Talent and  Compensation Committee, a Committee on Directors and  Corporate Governance, a Finance Committee, an ESG and  Public Policy Committee and an Executive Committee. The charter for each committee can be viewed on our  website, along with information about the company’s  corporate governance, including our Code of Business  Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Certificate  of Incorporation and Corporate By-laws. For more  information or to contact us, visit our website. The ESG and Public Policy Committee assists the Board  in overseeing the company’s policies and programs— and related risks to the company—that concern  environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public  policy matters, including progress against the company’s  ESG goals. The Committee’s scope includes public issues  of significance that may affect the company’s business,   our shareowners, the broader stakeholder community  or the general public. This entails evaluating and  reviewing information pertaining to social, political and  environmental trends, in addition to oversight of the  company’s ESG goals and human rights practices. In addition to its previously stated responsibilities,  the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board  of Directors oversees and reviews, at least annually,  the company’s public policy agenda, its position on  significant public policy matters, political contributions,  
and lobbying activities. The Committee reviews  shareowner proposals on issues within its purview  and makes recommendations on the proposals to the  Board. In addition, the Committee receives updates on  priority ESG issues, including information on actions  and progress toward goals. Annually, the Committee  conducts a self-evaluation, which it presents to the full  Board. The ESG and Public Policy Committee also bears the  highest level of direct responsibility for climate-related  issues. For a deeper dive into our climate governance,  visit the Climate section. Additionally, the company’s Talent and Compensation  Committee oversees human capital management policies  and strategies across the company, including talent  management, leadership and company culture initiatives  such as those promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. This senior-level commitment and alignment drives   top-down accountability toward our goals for diversity,  equity and inclusion (DEI) and helps support a positive  company culture. In 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee  approved plans to link ESG performance measures to our  annual and long-term incentive programs for executives. In the Annual Incentive program, we are reinforcing  our commitment to DEI by incorporating demonstrable  commitments by executives to reach goals that reflect  our 2030 aspirations to be 50% led by women globally,  and, in the United States, to align race and ethnicity  representation to U.S. census data. Similarly, in the long- term incentive program, predetermined goals related  to the company’s World Without Waste packaging  strategy and its 2030 Water Security Strategy have been  incorporated into the 2022-2024 incentive awards. We have a comprehensive reporting process that   spans many years, and we aim to provide stakeholders  with complete, transparent and candid information in  all our public communications. This is our fourth annual  Business & ESG Report, which combines financial   data and sustainability progress and performance in   one publication. We also respond to the CDP climate,   water and forests questionnaires and make those  disclosures publicly available. For our 2021 report, we  continue to expand our disclosure, including on public  policy, sweetener research, and DEI issues. We recognize there is a desire for standardization across  reporting frameworks, and we’re continually evaluating  reporting options and listening to stakeholder feedback. This report is prepared in accordance with the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, a globally recognized  framework; this is the eleventh year that these principles  have informed our reporting process. We provide an  index for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB) and participate in the SASB Advisory Group. We  also index to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures, the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  and the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting  Framework (UNGPRF). In addition to its previously stated responsibilities,  the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board  of Directors oversees and reviews, at least annually,  the company’s public policy agenda, its position on  significant public policy matters, political contributions  and lobbying activities. In the United States, participation  
in the political process provides opportunity for  meaningful engagement on public policy, regulatory and  legislative matters with potential impact on our business. In 2021, The Coca-Cola Company suspended  contributions to U.S. political candidates. During this  time, we strengthened our alignment of government  engagement with key issues affecting our business,  employees, customers, consumers and shareowners. Building upon equality and inclusion factors we formally  incorporated in 2020, we further enhanced our political  contributions criteria to ensure consistency with the  company’s values. We also increased our disclosures  and transparently outlined the non-deductible lobbying  amount provided by the company to trade associations  and organizations based in the United States in which  we have membership. Our participation, contributions  and disclosures are routinely reviewed against leading  industry standards. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance We pursue our ESG goals through a concerted effort by  The Coca-Cola Company and approximately 225 bottling  partners in more than 200 countries and territories. We  have robust internal processes and an effective internal  control environment that facilitate the identification and  management of risks and regular communication with  the Board, our Chairman and CEO and internal teams  such as the Enterprise Risk Management team, the Risk  Steering Committee and the Networked Sustainability  team, which includes Technical, Innovation and Supply  Chain; Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability;  Global Human Rights; Procurement; Legal; and Finance. Beyond this, our networked teams work with operating  units, bottling partners, NGOs, governments, investors  and people in communities all around the world to  identify risks and progress toward our goals. For more  about our approach to risk management and priority  issues, see Our Priority ESG Issues. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance Focusing on the highest-priority ESG issues for our  company, system and stakeholders is a foundational step  in how we conduct business and develop our corporate  strategy. It is also foundational to how we evolve and  report on our business and our ESG progress. Strategies  employed against these priority issues are designed  to build business resilience and adaptation to current  and future disruptions to operations, supply chain and  communities in which we operate. During 2019, we undertook a thorough review of our  priority issues in collaboration with a cross-functional  internal team and key external stakeholders. These  stakeholders represented deep expertise across a range  of issues and sectors, including NGOs, academia, some of  our business partners, suppliers, customers and beyond. We were guided by BSR, a leading sustainability NGO. In  2020, we reviewed our assessment to determine if any of  the priority issues had shifted as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic or the increased global spotlight on social  justice. A revised matrix adjusted several key issues to  better reflect priority issues. Both the 2019 analysis and the 2020 refresh were  aligned with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)  process. In 2021, we further strengthened the alignment  with our ERM processes and cross-functional teams. The aligned matrix adjusted several key issues to better  reflect current ESG priority issues, including: third party  service providers, bottling and business partners;  information protection and cybersecurity; and political  uncertainties and regulation. Analyzing our priority issues on a regular basis ensures  that we take into consideration the changing social,  environmental and economic context as we continue to  evolve our business. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance Companies like ours play an important role in helping  to create the systemic change necessary to achieve a  healthier planet and a more inclusive and sustainable  economy. Collaboration with a multitude of internal and external  stakeholders is essential if we are to achieve our  purpose of refreshing the world and making a difference. Meaningful partnerships with governments, business  and civil society can drive collective action and build  shared opportunities for people and communities  around the globe. As one of the world’s largest and most recognized  companies, we have an opportunity to use our size   and scale to take on global challenges that require  broad collective action, such as fostering excellence   in water stewardship, helping eliminate plastic waste  and supporting sustainable agriculture. As a global  business that operates locally, we can extend our  influence and reach because of the strength of the   Coca-Cola system, which includes bottling partners   in hundreds of communities worldwide. Transparency and accountability are fundamental  elements of our stakeholder engagement approach. We recently added new disclosures on our website  to provide an expanded, holistic overview of our  stakeholder engagement and scientific research,  including details of the journal articles we have authored  or funded dating to 2008 in areas such as low- and  no-calorie sweetener innovation, hydration, safety and  sustainability. Learn more. We engage with stakeholders through a variety of  means. Their insights and feedback are critical to  our work and are integrated into our strategy across  business and ESG goals. Partnerships are an important part of our work to  advance ESG goals, in part because many of our   goals cannot be achieved on our own. We must join  forces with others to address some of the world’s  biggest challenges. We have formed partnerships with a range of incredible  organizations that are making a difference in areas such  as sustainable agriculture, water replenishment and  sustainable packaging. Here are some of them: 
•  For more than a decade, we have partnered with  the World Wildlife Fund to improve the health of  freshwater basins. In August 2021, we renewed our  partnership for three more years. •  WASH4Work mobilizes business to improve access  to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in the  workplace, in communities and across supply chains. We are aligning with the WASH4Work framework as  part of our 2030 Water Security Strategy. •  The investment management firm Circulate Capital  incubates and finances companies and infrastructure  that prevent the flow of plastic waste into the world’s  oceans and advance the circular economy. In 2021,  Circulate Capital announced a $4 million investment  in the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Group’s  innovation lab to support startups in Latin America  and the Caribbean. •  We’re partnering with TerraCycle and Burger King®  in the United States, the United Kingdom, France  and Japan to reduce single-use packaging waste by  offering reusable cups and food containers. •  The Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform  (SAI Platform) promotes widespread adoption of  sustainable agriculture practices. In 2021, our  partnership with SAI Platform led to a significant   jump in the percentage of sustainably sourced   oranges from Florida groves. •  The Ocean Cleanup has developed Interceptor™  solutions to stop new plastic from entering the world’s  oceans through rivers. We’re partnering with them to  place Interceptor solutions in 15 priority rivers. To showcase our work and  partnerships across a variety of  ESG areas, the company held an  ESG investor event in 2021, where  members of our executive leadership  shared progress on the company’s  ESG strategy and goals, and how  they come to life in the regions. Innovation Collective Action Governance & Management Priority ESG Issues Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships Our Beverages Financial Highlights How We Operate At a Glance Addressing climate change and eliminating plastic waste are two of our  highest priority ESG issues. Although we are taking action within our  own operations and across our value chain, these global challenges are  far too great for any single company, industry or government to solve  on its own. In response, we are using our influence to drive meaningful  policy changes in partnership with peer companies, civil society and   all levels of government. In April 2021, The Coca-Cola Company supported  coalitions led by We Mean Business and Ceres in  the United States, and by European Parliamentary  Environment Committee Chair Pascal Canfin. These  coalitions called on the Biden Administration to set  an ambitious science-based greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions reduction target for the United States. The response was to establish a target ahead of the  COP26 summit, which brings the United States to a  position of global climate leadership. Recognizing our climate advocacy in the United States,  in July 2021, Ceres released its report “Practicing  Responsible Policy Engagement: How Large U.S.  Companies Lobby on Climate Change.” The report  highlighted that The Coca-Cola Company “has disclosed  its engagements to evolve the (U.S.) Chamber’s climate  change positions and lobbying."" The report also noted  that we sent a letter encouraging the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce to embrace the Business Roundtable’s  principles and policies on climate change. In the European context, in support of the EU’s Green  Deal and Farm-to-Fork strategy, in 2021 we signed  up to the EU Code of Conduct on Responsible Food  Business and Marketing Practices. This advocacy stance  complements our climate actions in collaboration with  our two major bottling partners in Europe. The role of government regulation in creating a circular  economy for our packaging materials is essential  to ensure that societies can move from a linear to a  circular operating model—one where materials stay  in the economy for reuse and recycling and out of the  environment. To support governments in the evolution  toward better recycling outcomes, we work with them  as well as with trade associations to provide evidence of  the safety and quality of recycled materials, which in turn  leads to increased take-up of recycled materials. In 2021, a number of governments around the world  established plastic packaging regulations similar to our  
World Without Waste strategy, helping address both the  waste challenge and the climate challenge. The regions  that established food/beverage grade acceptance  standards for recycled plastic content use include  Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman,  Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The state of California  also adopted new recyclability standards. We continue to play an active role in driving for  progressive policies that help solve environmental  challenges, whether that is direct engagement with  regulators on recycled PET usage standards or policy  advocacy directly or through trade associations. Additionally, several regions established minimum  recycled content guidelines, including Chile, Ecuador,  the European Union, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the  United States (California, New Jersey and the state of  Washington). Our World Without Waste goals aim for  50% recycled material in all our packages by 2030;  regulatory guidelines can help create scale in the supply  chain that helps with the economics of recycling and   a circular economy. Along with increasing recycled content, plastic   collection is essential to achieving a truly circular  economy. In 2020, we added our voice to the Business  Call for a UN Plastic Pollution Treaty calling for a legally  binding United Nations treaty on plastic pollution. We  also continued to work in partnership with WWF, the  Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Ocean Plastic  Leadership Network to bring diverse stakeholders  together to help shape a long-term treaty. In early 2022,  the United Nations agreed to start negotiations to draw  up a global treaty. Water is essential to every person and every  ecosystem in the world; it is also essential   to the products we make and the agricultural  ingredients we use. Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses   on increasing water security through  a context-based approach to water  replenishment, advocacy for smart water  policies and responsible water use across  our operations and supply chain. We’re using  the size and scale of our company to improve  water security where water risks impact our  business, supply chain and communities. 1   Peer-reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project   and operating unit; calculated benefits per project and operating unit using peer-reviewed  methodologies; all replenish data are internally validated and verified; the equivalent  volume for 100% Replenish rate (175 Billion Liters; BL) is externally assured; Benefits  fall into three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (229.1 BL), Water for  Productive Use (47.5 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (16.7 BL). Due to joint venture  or merger and acquisition activities between 2019 - 2021, certain brands may not be  accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages   is based on global sales volume. In 2020 and 2021, we analyzed water-related risks  to identify priority operating facilities, which allows  us to segment our operations into three categories:  Leadership Locations, Advanced Efficiency Locations and  Contributing Locations. We catalogued these locations  based on the detailed mapping and results from an  Enterprise Water Risk Assessment (EWRA) from the  World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from  Facility Water Vulnerability Assessments (FAWVA), our  site-level, internal proprietary tool. 1. LEADERSHIP LOCATIONS: our highest priority system  facility locations and their correlated watersheds  that have the highest potential water-related risks. Facilities are on a path toward 100% regenerative  water use by 2030. See next page for more on  regenerative water use. 2. ADVANCED EFFICIENCY LOCATIONS: system facility  locations in a water-stressed2 context that will drive  advanced water efficiency improvements in operations. 3. CONTRIBUTING LOCATIONS: system facility locations  in areas with potential low water-related risks yet will  contribute to water security overall by meeting 100%  compliance with global Coca-Cola Company water  stewardship requirements. We are mapping priority ingredient sourcing regions  and watersheds according to highest exposure to water  stress. We also began mapping priority communities  based on local context to identify opportunities for  action to strengthen communities’ access to water,  sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and their resilience to  climate change (e.g., floods and droughts). By mapping  and overlaying all three of these categories (operations,  watersheds and communities), we will identify overlaps  and interconnectivity across our action areas to develop  a holistic, integrated and context-based approach. Our 2030 Water Security Strategy  outlines a vision of increasing  water security for our operations,  watersheds and communities. Water security is defined as the  availability of a sufficient quantity  and quality of water, access to  safe water services and effective  governance of shared water  resources. It is underpinned by  global goals and specific context- based targets that will enable us  to measure our progress toward  reaching this vision. Our global goals for 2030 fall under  three pillars with one cross-cutting  goal, maintaining at least 100%  global replenishment of the water  used in our finished beverages: 
Increase water security  where we operate,  source ingredients and  touch people’s lives  by improving water  availability, quality, access  and governance. Maintain at least 100% global replenishment of the water used in our finished beverages through contextualized   interventions for operations, communities and watersheds. 2  Refers to “high” or “extremely high” water stress. Water stress  measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable  surface and groundwater supplies. Water issues intertwine with nearly all of our company’s highest priority ESG issues. Water is the  nexus that links individual health and well-being, economic prosperity, environmental health and  the empowerment of the most vulnerable in society, including women and girls. Enhanced water  management helps our business, supply chain and local communities build resilience to a changing  climate. This means improving capacities to withstand, recover from and adapt to the shocks and  stressors related to climate change. Following the process to identify and segment our  priority operating facilities, we are now setting local,  context-based targets1 for these facilities to contribute   to the achievement of our 2030 targets for this pillar,  which include: 
We will also continue to replenish at least 100% of water  used in our finished beverages globally. All our system production operations around the   world will continue to adopt and implement our new  Coca-Cola system Water Resource Sustainability  Standard, which is aligned with the Alliance for Water  Stewardship (AWS) principles. “ Regenerative” is our new integrated metric  reflecting the concept of circularity in using water  in our operations. By 2030, the Coca-Cola system  manufacturing facilities that we designate as  high priority (“Leadership Locations”) must  reduce, reuse, recycle and replenish the water  used in operations in the local correlated  watersheds for beneficial social, economic and/or  environmental uses by other stakeholders   and nature. We have been working with our bottling  partner COFCO Coca-Cola Beverages Limited  (CBL) to implement water saving initiatives at a  manufacturing facility in water-stressed Beijing. CBL has invested in multiple projects including  the recovery of water from cleaning and rinsing  processes, the redesign of a recovery system   for reverse osmosis treatment and using recycled  water for the flushing of toilets and cleaning of  external areas. These initiatives have resulted   in an approximately 2% reduction in water   use between December 2020 and December  2021, which is contributing to decreased stress   on local freshwater sources and reduced  operational costs. In Latin America, we’re launching a new program,  Aliados por el Agua (Allies for Water), across  18 countries that will mobilize collective action  to improve critical access to water, sanitation  and hygiene in vulnerable and water-stressed  communities and key watersheds. The program,  which aims to benefit an estimated 2 million  people by 2030, will replicate best practices  from a program that we have supported for  more than a decade in Africa. Aliados is a multi- sector partnership platform bringing together  actors from the public and private sectors and  civil society, and will be managed by The Global  Environment Technology Foundation (GETF). We implement a human rights-based approach to   water and communities. We recognize the connection  between our social license to operate and adequate  water infrastructure. Insufficient access to water, sanitation and hygiene  (WASH) infrastructure and poor water quality are key  challenges faced in water-stressed communities. Population growth, climate change, political conflict and  forced migration are further straining water infrastructure  and supply. COVID-19 exacerbated stresses on water  systems, highlighting the importance of WASH to enable  communities to protect themselves from disease spread. Over the past decade, The Coca-Cola Company has  established strong leadership in community water  programs with the support of The Coca-Cola Foundation  and many nonprofits, governments, customers and  other partners. Together, we have delivered sustainable  community water interventions ranging from improving  access to WASH to institutional capacity building,  benefiting more than 18.5 million people since 2010. In 2021, our WASH projects included:  
•  Installation of handwashing facilities and water  connections for communities in the Philippines to help  respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting  over 200,000 people 
•  Access to drinking water for more than 130,000 people  impacted by flooding and other natural disasters in  China in 2021  
Our 2030 Water Security Strategy builds on this work,  seeking to improve access to water and sanitation and  strengthen community resilience. We’re focused on  projects that will support and empower women and  girls who, in many parts of the world, bear most of the  responsibility for fetching water and running households. As outlined in the Risk Assessments and Prioritization  section, we are identifying our priority operational,  commercial and sourcing communities. We are using a  set of criteria from leading global institutions specializing  in water and health. We aim to support all our priority  communities in addressing shared water challenges by  identifying and implementing interventions focused on  three primary action areas: 
  Clean water is only one piece of the water resilience  puzzle. To achieve the greatest health and economic  benefits, improvements in sanitation and hygiene  must be prioritized alongside access to clean water. We recognize our business operates in areas with  significant challenges to water access and sanitation. This is one reason why sustainable access to water,  sanitation and hygiene—particularly for women and  girls—is specifically addressed in our 2030 strategy. We’re collaborating with international organizations  and coalitions such as WaterAid and Global Water  Challenge to understand and meet the needs of  
women and girls and to systemically embed and  measure gender-related outcomes of community  WASH programs. This work will build on the  groundbreaking findings of the 2018 Ripple Effect  Study—which quantified the significant impact of  WASH improvements on women’s empowerment— and draw on learnings from the successful Replenish  Africa Initiative (RAIN) and our 5by20® economic  empowerment initiative. “In communities where water is  scarce, women and girls are  responsible for the grueling task  of collecting water, resulting in  missed opportunities for learning,  generating income and pursuing a  brighter future. We’re proud to work  with The Coca-Cola Company to  drive change through the power of  clean water and to involve women  every step of the way to ensure  inclusive, long-term solutions to the  world’s most pressing problems.”  
Since 2010, our RAIN initiative  has reached more than 6.7  million people in 41 countries  and territories in Africa with safe,  sustainable access to water,  sanitation and hygiene, impacting  more than 4,000 communities. A pilot project in the highly water-stressed state of California is just one example  of the focus on watershed health in our strategy. Our North American operating  unit is partnering with The Nature Conservancy and other nonprofits to establish  a watershed health plan for three vulnerable California watersheds that  supply water to our system bottling plants and for our agricultural ingredients  (particularly almonds and lemons). We developed watershed health scorecards,  highlighting the greatest challenges and risks in the prioritized watersheds. The pilot project developed corresponding Watershed Stewardship Plans  that identify actions to help improve watershed health and water security  for our operations, ingredient sourcing areas and communities. This includes  projects such as meadow and forest restoration, invasive species removal, fire  management and prevention, and water-use efficiency. These plans will also help  us to track improvements in watershed health and co-benefits of projects (e.g. enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration). Improved agricultural management practices can promote watershed health. Water use within our agriculture supply chain accounts for 92% of our blue  water1 footprint. (See the Sustainable Agriculture section for more detail on   our work on sustainable sourcing.) Our work to identify priority watersheds  and communities includes an assessment of water risks for watersheds where  our global priority ingredients are grown. Watersheds supply water for drinking, agriculture and  manufacturing, provide habitat for plants and animals,  and offer opportunities for recreation. While watershed  protection has been a core element of our work for   more than a decade, our new strategy places much  greater emphasis on the holistic improvement of  watershed health. As outlined earlier in this section, in 2020, we began  analyzing and prioritizing our operational, commercial  and ingredient sourcing watersheds. Over the past year, we have developed a Watershed  Health Framework to provide our operations with help   to assess watersheds' challenges and risks, and  implement context-based Watershed Stewardship Plans. Watershed risks vary from location to location. For some,  water availability may be the primary risk; for others,  it might be water quality, water access, soil health or  forest fires, to name a few. By adopting a context-based  approach, we aim to support interventions relevant to  our priority watersheds. This work at the local watershed level will contribute   to the achievement of our 2030 high level targets: 
1   Blue water is the volume of surface and groundwater consumed as a result of the production of a good  or service (evaporated or embedded in the product). Source: Water Footprint Network. In 2021, we were proud to earn a place on CDP’s “A List” for the  first time for our leadership in corporate transparency and action  on water security, joining our bottling partners Swire Coca-Cola  Limited, Coca-Cola HBC and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, which  were also recognized with the highest scores. Out of some 13,000  companies, only 118 companies made the 2021 water security  “A List.” The vision, ambition and risk-based approach behind our  2030 Water Security Strategy also drew recognition from Ceres   in its 2021 Feeding Ourselves Thirsty report that analyzes how  large food and beverage companies are managing water risks  in their direct operations and supply chains. The Coca-Cola  Company was the top scorer out of all 38 companies assessed  across four sectors: Agricultural Products, Beverages, Meat and  Packaged Foods, with a score of 90 out of 100 possible points. Infrastructure and construction can help protect vulnerable water systems. But nature itself often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed  health. We invest in nature-based solutions (NBS), which build on natural  processes to manage water systems. To achieve our 2030 vision, we will lean  even more heavily into nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and  floodplain management. These types of solutions can provide a wide range of benefits, such as better  water quality, carbon sequestration and enhanced biodiversity. Other direct  and indirect benefits include water resource improvements, socioeconomic and  public health benefits and climate change mitigation. In 2020 and 2021, we worked to identify and quantify the co-benefits of some  of our replenishment projects to help us determine where to support future  investments. In Europe, we partnered with denkstatt, an organization that  advises businesses on natural and social capital, to develop a methodology  to help us quantify the co-benefits of NBS projects. We also worked with The  Nature Conservancy to pilot the CEO Water Mandate NBS Tool across more than  10 projects globally to better understand the links between various types of  replenishment projects and nature-based solutions, helping to strengthen the  business case for investment in these projects. “ The Coca-Cola Company’s  ongoing commitment to  managing water risks sets  an example to the industry  on the type of work we  need to see more   of in corporate America.” 
Addressing water issues is a  crucial part of our holistic ESG  strategy, which is overseen by the  Board of Directors. To reinforce  the importance of these issues,  certain ESG metrics have been  incorporated into executive  compensation. See the Governance  section for more details. The shared nature of water resources requires collective action to  remediate water challenges. Read more about our approach to stakeholder  engagement and partnerships. “ The integrated approach behind the WWF  Guatemala project defines how companies need to  think and act if we’re truly going to improve water,  agricultural and climate resilience. This approach  underpins the thinking behind our 2030 Water  Security Strategy. We’re breaking down silos,  designing holistic water stewardship interventions  that have cross-cutting impacts.”  
For more than a decade, The Coca-Cola Company has partnered   with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Fundación Defensores   de la Naturaleza on an integrated watershed management project  that addresses the interconnected issues of climate, water and  agriculture. The cloud forest of the Sierra de las Minas mountains  of Eastern Guatemala serves as the primary source  of water for thousands of people who live and work  in communities that are located in the Pasabien and  Teculutan watersheds. The rivers that flow down the  mountainside once provided a plentiful supply of water  for human consumption, agriculture and business. However, deforestation, intensive agriculture and   human encroachment into the area—combined with  a changing climate—degraded the natural ecosystem  of these watersheds. This led to droughts, forest  fires, polluted water sources and crop failure, with  dire consequences for both nature and people: loss  of biodiversity, respiratory problems from smoke and  increased competition for scarce resources. In response, more than a decade ago, WWF and the  Fundación Defensores de la Naturaleza launched  an integrated watershed management project that  simultaneously addressed the interconnected issues of  climate, water and agriculture. The Coca-Cola Company  was among the first to sign on as a partner and joined  the project in 2007—now one of many WWF projects we  are proud to support around the world. In the Teculutan and Pasabien watersheds,   The Coca-Cola Company provided funding and partnered  with WWF for technical expertise while our local bottling  partner, ABASA, signed a conservation agreement to   help protect 500 hectares of forests through fire  prevention activities and controlled burning. WWF also engaged local communities, farmers and  businesses on the importance of forest preservation  and supported farmers to use sustainable agriculture  practices, such as improved crop irrigation, to reduce  water use and agricultural run-off. In addition, the project  provided local people with energy efficient cook stoves  to help reduce the demand for charcoal required for  cooking. And local businesses, including our bottling  partner, were encouraged to reduce their water use and  improve their treatment of wastewater. These activities have helped to reduce deforestation  and land clearing for agriculture use, decrease forest  fire frequency by 46% (comparing 2020 to 2015), reduce  agricultural run-off by over 30,000 tons per year, improve  farmer incomes and replenish 400 million liters of water  annually. “ The Coca-Cola Company has been one of our pilot  partners when it comes to investing in the right  way and the right solutions. We have three core  concepts of resilience: not harming nature, using  nature to help people, and helping nature adapt. Coca-Cola has been great working with us toward  implementing these very important principles in  Guatemala.” For more than a century, our  company has been known for  our refreshing beverages—a  legacy that began in 1886. Over  the decades, we’ve continued  to evolve, and today we offer a  lineup of beverages across five  categories, providing consumers  with a wealth of choices—including  drinks with less added sugar   and beverages with nutrition  benefits. Offering a portfolio   of drinks for consumers’  beverage needs and  preferences throughout  the day, including  nutrition and hydration 
Continuing to seek opportunities  to reduce added sugar across our  portfolio, including investments in  sweetener innovation 
Our evolution as a total  beverage company  continues as we respond   to consumer desires for  more choices across a wider  range of categories. We have  streamlined our portfolio,  focusing on brands with the  greatest potential   to scale and grow. We track the results of our sugar-reduction efforts; the majority of the added-sugar  reductions stem from changes to our sparkling beverage recipes and packaging size  reductions. Average calories per pack1 dropped by 3.4% in 2021. 900,000+ 
tons of added sugar removed from  our global portfolio cumulatively2  through efforts to reformulate  more than 1,000 beverages 
1   The calories per pack metric takes into account both levers to reduce sugar: recipe changes and package size changes. We have joined with industry peers to participate  in more than 40 sugar reduction initiatives around  the world, tailoring our approach in each market  to help reduce intake of added sugar. In North America, we’re part of the American  Beverage Association’s Balance Calories Initiative  (BCI), which has committed to decrease beverage  calories in the American diet by 20% per person  by 2025. A BCI report released in early 2022  found that average calories per 8-oz. serving  have declined between 10% and 15.5% since 2014  in five select communities where the beverage  industry is measuring progress. •  The Mexican Beverage Industry Association’s  pledge, which has committed to reducing  the calorie content of its member companies’  portfolios by 20% between 2018 and 2024. •  The European soft drinks industry (UNESDA)  pledged to reduce average added sugars  in soft drinks by another 10% from 2019 to  2025 across the European Union and the  United Kingdom. This will represent a 33%  overall reduction in average added sugars  over the last two decades, building on past  sugar reduction milestones that the industry  achieved.3 
The Coca-Cola Company supports the recommendation  of leading health authorities that individuals should  consume no more than 10% of their total daily calories  from added sugar, and we continue to prioritize sugar  reduction. In 2021, we continued to change recipes to reduce added  sugar; offer more beverages in smaller packages to  enable portion control; and promote low- and no-calorie  beverage options. The Coca-Cola Company has a decades-long history  of investment in sweetener innovation for beverages,  developing the first zero-sugar sparkling soft drink  in 1963. More recently, we have focused on naturally  occurring sugar alternatives and worked with suppliers  to develop some of the first commercially available  versions of stevia. Our investments—typically in  collaboration with industry peers, suppliers, startups  and academic institutions—have helped lead to the  
development and broad use of stevia and other options. The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than   $100 million in sweetener innovation and sugar reduction  research since 2008. We have been joined in such  efforts by other members of the food, beverage and  ingredient industries, which have invested more than $1  billion combined during this same period. A global list of  published journal articles going back to 2008, reflecting  research that The Coca-Cola Company has directly  funded (either partially or fully) or authored, can be found  on our website. These include a range of topics core to  our business, including sweetener innovation. We continue to develop and market new beverage  options that maintain the great tastes people love,   but with less added sugar and fewer calories. In 2021,   we rolled out a new and improved recipe of Coca-Cola®  Zero Sugar, which brings the brand even closer in taste  to original Coca-Cola. First launched in 2005, Coca-Cola  Zero Sugar grew volume by double digits in 2021, and   the new formula has driven accelerated growth in 80%  of the markets where it was launched. Coca-Cola Zero  Sugar is available in more than 180 markets around   the world. In 2021, average sugar per 100 ml declined while  global volume grew. In 2020, both average sugar  per 100 ml and volume declined, primarily due to  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Smaller packaging options help people control  added sugar intake for themselves and their  families. Globally, about 41% of our sparkling soft  drink brands come in packages of 250 ml   (8.5 oz.) or less. We’re bringing drinks such as teas, juices, dairy, plant- based products and purified water to more people  in more places. We’re making many of our beverages  nutritious by fortifying them with vitamins and minerals,  while also introducing more dairy and plant-based  beverages. We’re focused on addressing the specific  nutritional needs of populations where under-nutrition   is an ongoing concern. For example, our fairlife brand is adding protein to more  diets while introducing new and reformulated products  that continue to improve taste and nutritional profile. fairlife removed nearly 2 million pounds of sugar from  the diets of those who drink fairlife versus other milk.1  For those looking to add even more protein to their diets,  fairlife’s Nutrition Plan™ shake offers 30 grams of protein  with just 2 grams of sugar. In 2021, we launched fairlife in China, where milk  consumption is on the rise. Beyond protein, fairlife  products offer multiple benefits, including high calcium  content and zero lactose. The brand uses ultra-filtration  technology to retain more nutrients. 1   Calculated by number of products sold multiplied by sugar reduced  (50%) for full year 2021. This is based on the volume of fairlife milk  having 50% less sugar than other milks, and Good Moo’d milk having  25% less sugar than other milks. Minute Maid Kids is a low- calorie children's drink with  no added sugar, preservatives  or artificial sweeteners. The  product is an excellent source  of vitamin C for children ages   6 to 12. BodyArmor Lyte is a low- calorie sports drink with no  added sugar and no artificial  sweeteners, flavors or dyes. Available in nine flavors,  the drinks are packed with  electrolytes, antioxidants and  select B vitamins. Costa Coffee Latte+ beverages  are infused with specially  crafted functional ingredients  and plant-based milk. Available  in three varieties, including  Caramel Oat Latte+ (with  added vitamin B12 and zinc),  Hazelnut Almond Latte+ (with  added plant protein), and  Vanilla Coconut Latte+ (with  added vitamin B12 and zinc). innocent Super Smoothie  Light launched in 2021 in the  United Kingdom. Made with  100% fruit, two new smoothie  flavors contain 30% less  natural sugar than the original  Super Smoothie range. The  Super Smoothie Light drinks  are high in select B vitamins  and E vitamins and provide a  good source of fiber. vitaminwater gutsy, which  launched in the United  States in 2021, is a refreshing  watermelon-peach-flavored  water beverage with B and C  vitamins and zero sugar. At just  10 calories per 20 fluid ounces,  it also offers 5 grams of fiber  and electrolytes. AdeZ Barista professional  series offers 100% plant-based  drinks with no added sugars  for sale in Costa stores across  a number of European markets. The drinks, which come in  coconut, almond, soy and oat,  are naturally free of lactose  and gluten. smartwater+ water enhancers  are naturally flavored and   have been formulated by  biomedical engineers with  a patented oxygen delivery  technology to include vitamin  B12 and iron to contribute to  the reduction of fatigue. Mojo is a range of kombucha  sodas with added prebiotic  fiber to support gut health. Available in Australia, the  certified-organic sodas are  naturally low in sugar and made  with real fruit puree and juice. We’re committed to the responsible marketing of our  products and have a history of aligning our commercial  practices with our sustainability goals, our business goals  and our values. We do not market any of our products directly to children  under 13, regardless of nutritional profile. We respect the  role of parents and caregivers as the primary decision- makers for what their children drink. We hold everyone who is involved in our marketing   and communications accountable to our Global  Responsible Marketing Policy, from our employees and  bottling partners to our agency and media partners. We require annual trainings for all relevant employees  as part of our Coca-Cola University. We have created  a Global Responsible Marketing Taskforce and local  taskforces across all our operating units who monitor  compliance, guide our marketers in their daily work and  are equipped to address any identified non-compliances. Read our full policy. In addition to our own company’s Global Responsible  Marketing Policy, we are a founding member of the  International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA), a group  of 11 leading food and beverage companies that self- regulate globally on responsible marketing to children. In 2021, together with our industry peers at IFBA, we  strengthened our policy further. Effective January 1, 2022,  we increased the age threshold from under 12 to under  13 and we reduced the audience threshold from 35%  to 30%. This means we will not place our marketing or  advertising in any media, platform or event where more  than 30% of the audience is under 13. We also partner with industry at regional and local levels  to scale collective action in responsible marketing pledge  programs. These include the EU Pledge in the European  Union and The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising  Initiative (CFBAI) in the United States. Through our voluntary actions we aim to reduce  children’s exposure to foods that are high in fat, sugar  and salt (HFSS) across all media, including digital. In  2021, an independent study commissioned by the World  Federation of Advertisers in 12 markets showed that  only 1.45% of online ads served to children are HFSS  products.1 
We recognize that our growth into alcohol brands  brings new responsibilities. To ensure accountability,  we developed The Coca-Cola Company’s Global  Policy on Alcohol Responsibility. As part of our entry  into the category, we developed local partnerships  and communications programs to help reduce and  prevent the harmful use of alcohol in line with goals  established by leading health authorities. We worked  with Drinkaware in Great Britain; the Social Research  Foundation in Mexico (FISAC); the Akatu, CISA and Ekloos  organizations in Brazil; and organizations in Japan to  support responsible drinking programs or messages. In  all our activities, we seek to grow our alcohol brands in a  responsible and sustainable manner. We are committed to providing transparent back- and front-of-package nutrition  information, in line with local regulations. We support evidence-based interpretive front- of-package nutrition labeling, which can be a useful tool to help people make informed  dietary choices that fit their diets and lifestyles. We’re working with trade associations,  governments, civil society and other stakeholders to develop the most appropriate  labeling programs aligned with local needs. Nutrition information can be found on the vast majority of our products, with the  exception of certain returnable bottles, fountain beverages and waters (unsweetened,  unflavored). For these beverage and packaging types, nutrition information is provided  through our company and bottler websites as well as consumer hotlines. 1   The Digital Avatar Project was commissioned by the World  Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and was conducted by independent  research firm Nielsen using avatars that mimic the real browsing  behavior of children online. The study was conducted across 12  major markets; a total of 30,593 ads were analyzed, captured by  the child avatar visiting 100 URLs per market over a period of three  weeks in October 2021. We’re providing consumers with beverages  for every moment of the day and  responding to consumer preferences with  options that contain less sugar and more  nutrition and functional benefits. Our total  beverage portfolio is driving growth:  
•  AHA has seen triple the retail value  growth compared to the sparkling water  category as a whole in the United States Tackling the global plastic waste crisis  requires cross-sector collaboration and  alignment on common principles and targets. Our World Without Waste initiative is anchored  by three fundamental goals: making 100% of  our packaging recyclable globally by 2025— and using at least 50% recycled material in  our packaging by 2030 (Design); collecting  and recycling a bottle or can for each one we  sell by 2030 (Collect); and bringing people  together to support a healthy, debris-free  environment (Partner). Our World Without Waste   packaging goals require collective  action in partnership with a   range of stakeholders at a global,  regional and local level. •  Customers, peers and industry associations to shape  public policy and take action that supports a circular  economy 
•  Suppliers, startups and R&D partners to fuel  sustainable packaging innovation that reduces waste  and minimizes our environmental impact—one bottle   at a time. A World Without Waste, where materials are reused  and recycled as part of a circular economy, is a world  with dramatically lower carbon emissions and climate  impacts, which is why our packaging and climate  strategies are intertwined. Because packaging accounts  for up to 30% of our overall carbon footprint, our   World Without Waste efforts are essential to meeting   our science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions and our vision to be net zero carbon. We’re reducing our carbon footprint by lightweighting  our packaging, incorporating more recycled and  renewable material, investing in local recycling programs  and increasing our use of reusable packaging. We continue to rethink our beverage packaging to  become more sustainable. Most recently, we announced  a global, and industry-leading, reusable packaging goal. In North America, we eliminated more than 60,000  metric tons of virgin PET from our packaging mix in 2021  by increasing our usage of recycled PET plastic (rPET) to  12% of our portfolio and through regional and national  launches of 100% rPET3 packaging on select brands. In  Europe, we eliminated more than 130,000 metric tons of  virgin PET from our packaging mix in 2021 by increasing  our usage of recycled rPET to 31% of our portfolio. We now offer beverages in 100% rPET bottles (excluding  caps and labels) in approximately 30 markets. In 2021,  Coca-Cola Japan introduced 100% recycled PET bottles  for two brands: Coca-Cola and Georgia - and 40% of  the PET plastic used in Japan in 2021 was either from  recycled or renewable material. In countries accounting for approximately 25% of our  global PET use, rPET cannot currently be used in food- grade material. We continue to work with industry peers  to advocate for government regulations permitting  the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging. Over  
the last several years, countries as diverse as Bahrain,  Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia and South Korea have adopted standards  for food- and beverage-grade rPET usage. 3  Except where otherwise indicated, where reference is made in this  report to 100% Recycled PET or 100% Recycled Plastic Beverage  Packaging, we are referring to the material from which the plastic  bottle is made, not the cap and label. 2021 STATUS  We avoided almost half a million tons of virgin  plastic usage through our lightweighting,  recycled plastic and renewable material efforts  in 2021  
Reduce our use of virgin plastic derived   from non-renewable sources by a cumulative   3 million metric tons by 2025 
By 2030, we aim to  have at least 25% of our  beverages worldwide  by volume sold in  refillable/returnable  glass or plastic  bottles or in fountain  dispensers with  reusable packaging •  Investing in the expansion of the “universal bottle,”  which was first introduced in 2018 by Coca-Cola  Brazil and used in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,  Guatemala and Panama. This innovative solution— which the Ellen MacArthur Foundation recognizes   as a great example of reusable packaging, aligned   with its vision for a circular economy for plastics— drives efficiency of collection, cleaning and filling   by offering multiple sparkling and still brands in the  same reusable bottle. Additionally, we expanded  the rollout of refillable 2-liter and 1.5-liter PET plastic  bottles in South Africa, and partnered with Coca-Cola  Southwest Beverages to pilot a 500-ml returnable  glass bottle in Texas. •  Collaborating with Tesco to pilot the Loop™ shopping  system in 10 retail outlets across Europe. Consumers  can order a variety of products, including Coca-Cola,  in packaging that is collected, cleaned, refilled and  reused or recycled. •  Piloting a digital solution in Brazil and Chile for the  returnable bottle exchange process through virtual  coupons. •  Partnering with several foodservice customers,  including teaming up with Burger King® in the United  States, the United Kingdom and Japan to reduce  single-use packaging waste by offering reusable cups  and food containers, and piloting an exchangeable cup,  called the Cup Crew, with A&W Canada restaurants. •  Introducing reusable cups with microchip technology  for Coca-Cola Freestyle machines in theme parks, on  university campuses and on cruise ships in the United  States. •  Stepping up our commitment to the NextGen  Consortium to accelerate the circularity of foodservice  packaging, including cups. The consortium has  expanded its work to advance reuse and refill  packaging models, strengthen recycling and  composting infrastructure and recovery pathways, and  scale foodservice packaging innovation. •  Trialing package-less vending machines at Universal  Studios theme parks in Japan. The machines, which  allow consumers to fill their own containers with  sparkling and still water, also offer reusable bottles  and a rinsing station. •  Offering three of our most popular brands in  Germany—Fanta Orange, Sprite and Mezzo Mix—as  soda syrups for consumers to prepare drinks at home  by adding carbonated water. The pilot supports our  ongoing efforts to provide people with the brands they  love with less packaging. This builds on our already strong  track record with refillable packaging,  especially in parts of Latin America,  Europe, Africa and Asia. The COVID-19  pandemic has accelerated consumer  interest in refillables, as more families  enjoy multi-serve beverages at home  and seek affordable options in uncertain  economic times. By 2030, we aim to have   at least 25% of our beverages  worldwide by volume sold   in refillable/returnable glass  or plastic bottles or in fountain  dispensers with reusable  packaging. More than a decade ago, we introduced the world’s  first recyclable PET plastic bottle made with up  to 30% plant-based material. In 2021, we unveiled  a first-ever prototype bottle made from 100%  plant-based plastic, that has been made using  technologies that are ready for commercial scale  (excluding the cap and label). The new prototype exclusively uses materials  from renewable, plant-based sources, removing  all petroleum-based content from the bottle. It  represents a significant technological step forward  in the reduction of virgin oil-based PET across  commercially produced bottles. Learn more. Plant-based plastics will play a critical role in our  overall PET mix in the future, supporting our goals to  decrease our carbon footprint, reduce our reliance  on virgin fossil fuels and boost collection of PET in  support of a circular economy. “We have been working with technology  partners for many years to develop the  right technologies to create a bottle with  100% plant-based content—aiming for the  lowest possible carbon footprint—and  it’s exciting that we have reached a point  where these technologies exist and can be  scaled by participants in the value chain.”  
Building on the 2020 launch  of our first label-less bottle  for I LOHAS in Japan, South  Korea launched the first  label-less Coca-Cola PET  plastic bottle with the iconic  contour shape and engraved  logo, and Bonaqua launched  its first label-less bottle in  Hong Kong. Since labels  have to be removed prior to  recycling in these markets,  these innovations make our  packaging easier to recycle. Costa recently introduced cups  made from 100% plant-based  materials1 in its coffee shops in  the United Kingdom. The carbon  footprint of these cups, when  recycled, is 26% lower than  standard to-go cups. The brand also  refreshed its reusable cup incentive  program, further encouraging  consumers to play their part in  helping to reduce waste. Sprite, one of our largest global  sparkling soft drink brands, is  transitioning from its iconic green  bottles to clear PET to help make  them easier to make into new  bottles by increasing the supply of  high-value recycled plastic in the  after-use market. As of the end of  2021, 47 markets had switched from  green to clear, and another 70-plus— including the United States and  Canada—plan to transition in 2022. of the equivalent bottles  and cans we introduced into  the market in 2021 were  collected and refilled or  collected for recycling.1 61%  
We work with partners across business,  government and civil society to create  closed-loop systems that ensure our  packages are collected and recycled or  reused. Our 2021 efforts included: 
•  In Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands,  we joined the ANZPAC Plastics Pact to pursue four  2025 targets: Eliminate unnecessary and problematic  plastic packaging through redesign, innovation and  alternative delivery models; make 100% of plastic  packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable;  increase plastic packaging collected and recycled by  25%; and achieve an average of 25% recycled content  in plastic packaging across the region. •  In Brazil, we teamed up with bottling partners Solar  Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola FEMSA on the Recicla  Solar and SustentaPet post-consumer PET collection  and recycling initiatives. Since launching in 2019,  SustentaPet has collected 46,000 tons of PET (more  than 1 billion bottles). •  In Indonesia, we broke ground on a joint venture PET  recycling facility with Dynapack Asia in West Java. •  In the Philippines, we are partnering with Indorama  Ventures to establish PETValue, the country’s first  bottle-to-bottle recycling facility capable of processing  almost 2 billion plastic bottles per year. •  In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we joined Project  RECAPP along with industry peers and the Ministry  of Climate Change and Environment to create the  country’s first free, door-to-door recycling service. RECAPP has built a community of 15,000 registered  users and collected 115 metric tons of recyclables. •  In Mexico, we announced a $500 million system  investment to expand the refillables capacity through  four new production lines and to expand the country’s  recycling infrastructure by boosting production  capacity at PETSTAR and inaugurating a new recycling  plant in Tabasco. This will generate approximately  2,900 direct and 35,000 indirect jobs and increase  Mexico’s rPET capabilities by up to 51%. •  In Islamabad, Pakistan, we partnered with   TeamUp/ National Incubation Center (NIC) and   Capital Development Authority (CDA) to pave   the country’s first plastic road using 10 tons of  recycled plastic bottles. In Mexico, we partnered with small retail  customers on the “Mi tiendita sin residuos”   (“My store without waste”) program to transform  stores into PET collection centers. Consumers  can return empty bottles to participating retail  outlets to be recycled. In addition to promoting  environmental awareness in local communities,  early results show consumers are more likely to  buy our beverages in participating stores. In Romania, we support Carrefour’s “Pay with  1 PET” program, which lets grocery shoppers  exchange empty PET bottles for free fruit and  vegetables. More than 10,000 consumers have  participated to date, resulting in more than  200,000 PET bottles collected. Our partnership  with Carrefour in Romania is underpinned by  our commitment to The Food Transition Pact, a  reciprocal commitment between Carrefour and  its partner suppliers. In the United States, we launched a national  marketing campaign to promote our sustainable  packaging strategy following the national rollout  of the 13.2-oz. Coca-Cola bottle, and 20-oz in  certain markets, made of 100% recycled PET. The campaign’s “Recycle and Re-Enjoy It”  message conveys that plastic is a valuable  commodity designed to be used again and again,  and that empty packages can be part of the  circular economy. 1   The collection rates represent average collection rates for select  primary consumer packaging, which is the percentage of our  packaging that was collected for recycling (or refill). “The Ocean Cleanup’s mission is to rid the oceans of  plastic. With 1,000 rivers emitting nearly 80% of river- carried plastic into oceans, this massive problem grows  by the day, which is why we are always looking to  accelerate our progress. Among the waste we collect  with our cleanup systems, we find many plastic bottles,  including Coca-Cola packaging, so I applaud them for  being the first in the industry to join our mission, as  part of their wider actions to make a positive impact on  plastic pollution.”  
We sponsor AB InBev’s 100+ Accelerator, an open- innovation program that is committed to crowdsourcing  and piloting sustainability-focused startups and  solutions. In the most recent cohort, we provided  funding, training, mentoring and other hands-on  support to seven startups for a pilot program of about  nine months, including two startups focused on the  circular economy. For example, ReciVeci developed a  mobile app to increase the recovery of recyclable and  returnable materials in Ecuador and RecyclePoints in  Nigeria incentivizes people to recycle PET bottles and  other materials through points that can be redeemed for  cash and household goods. Learn about BanQu—a 100+  Accelerator alum. We are an investor in Circulate Capital, a fund focused  on ventures, infrastructure and innovations preventing  the flow of plastic into oceans. Since 2019, Circulate  Capital has raised more than $100 million and invested  in 14 companies in India and Indonesia. In 2021, Circulate  Capital announced a $4 million investment in the Inter- American Development Bank Group’s innovation lab to  support startups in Latin America and the Caribbean. “In today’s interconnected world, none  of us can solve the biggest social and  environmental challenges of our time alone. We believe that partnerships and collective  action are needed to deliver both a more  sustainable business and a sustainable  future, and that we must look outside our  company for ideas and solutions.”  
We believe that solutions to the  world’s plastic waste challenges  can best be unlocked when  stakeholders work collaboratively  to create systems that enable  positive change. We have partnered with The Ocean Cleanup, which has  developed solutions and technology to reduce ocean  plastic. Its Interceptor™ solutions extract plastic from  rivers, preventing it from reaching oceans. Our new  Rivers partnership, which pairs our scale and network  with The Ocean Cleanup’s technology and data-driven  solutions, aims to place cleanup systems in 15 priority  rivers around the world so that they can validate the  technology and extend to additional critical rivers. Local teams will partner with waste management  coalitions to sort and, where possible, eventually   turn PET plastic bottles captured from river waste   into new bottles. Our partnership with The Ocean Cleanup builds on   The Coca-Cola Foundation’s support to the Benioff Ocean  Institute at the University of California-Santa Barbara,  which supports river cleanup efforts in Panama, Vietnam,  India, Indonesia, Ecuador, Mexico, Thailand, Jamaica  and Kenya. Despite ongoing challenges posed by the  COVID-19 pandemic, the coalition collected 425 tons  of plastic waste in 2021; hosted its first-annual virtual  symposium; and launched a data dashboard highlighting  key metrics, including plastic captured by type and  number of people reached through education and  community outreach. Climate change is a priority issue for our  business. We have a responsibility to reduce  the carbon footprint of our value chain; to  improve business resilience by managing  short- and long-term risks and impacts of a  changing climate; and to foster partnerships  that drive positive change. Our approach to addressing climate change has accelerated in recent years  in keeping with the scale and urgency of the issue. Even as we achieved our  2020 “drink in your hand” goal to reduce our relative carbon emissions by  25% against a 2010 baseline, we increased our climate ambition. The ESG and Public Policy Committee, established by  our Board of Directors, bears the highest level of direct  responsibility for climate-related issues. The committee  assists the Board in overseeing the company’s  environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public  policy matters, including progress against our science- based target. The committee reports regularly to the full  Board on matters it oversees, including climate-related  issues. To learn more about our ESG governance structure, see  the Governance section. For more on climate-related  governance, see our most recent CDP Climate Change  response, Section C1. Building on our first climate risk scenario analysis in  2019, we undertook a far-reaching new study across our  company and agricultural supply chain in 2021, looking at  three scenarios: Business As Usual1 (warming above 5°C),  Middle of the Road2 (warming limited to 2.7°C) and Low  Carbon3 (warming kept below 2°C). This process enabled  us to identify a refined set of climate-related risks and  opportunities—including both physical and transition  impacts—in a range of possible futures. This will be a  critical tool for strategic planning and implementing  resilience plans. We will further analyze the risks and  opportunities identified to ensure we have appropriate  risk-management strategies in place. We will disclose  details in our forthcoming CDP Climate Change response. We have established a cross-functional and cross- company Enterprise Risk Management process and Risk  Steering Committee to oversee regular system-wide  risk assessments, and we work to integrate climate risk  planning into this process. Relevant risks that could materially affect our business,  including our financial results, are disclosed in the   Annual Report on Form 10-K. These include risks relating  to climate change, such as physical risks from changes  in weather patterns around the globe and an increase  in the frequency and severity of natural disasters  which may limit the availability or increase the cost  of key agricultural commodities. Climate change may  also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further  deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which  could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola system’s  bottling operations. Increasing concern over climate  change also may result in additional legal or regulatory  requirements, among others. We’ve announced both our science-based target to  reduce our absolute emissions by 25% by 2030 against a  2015 baseline and an ambition to be net zero carbon by  2050. Several of our bottling partners have announced  their own science-based targets and net zero pledges,  which will help drive even more positive climate action  across the Coca-Cola system. In line with our net zero ambition, we conducted  preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to  define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero  transition by 2050. A significant amount of our impact is in our supply chain,  so we encourage suppliers—representing approximately  80% of spend across most major procurement  categories—to respond to the CDP Supply Chain Climate  Change questionnaire. In 2021 we saw a threefold  increase in the number of supplier responses compared  to the previous year. We believe that continued progress against our goals— in combination with supporting key stakeholders as  they strengthen their own ambitions—will be critical to  making meaningful advances on climate. We have also  undertaken additional climate scenario risk analysis to  better understand the potential near- and longer-term  impacts of a changing climate on our business. already had science-based targets  in 2021, and an additional 49  suppliers have committed through  the Science-Based Targets initiative  (SBTi) to setting science-based  targets in the near term. 70 SUPPLIERS 
The Coca-Cola Company  applies the recommendations  of the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) in this report and in  a TCFD Index and provides  comprehensive disclosures to  CDP on Climate Change. Many of our agricultural suppliers report  annually on their performance and progress  in reducing emissions, which constitute  20-25% of our total value chain emissions,  and on plans to achieve further reductions. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture  (PSA) include maximizing energy efficiency  and use of renewable energy, employing  responsible forest management practices that  protect biodiversity and restore degraded  ecosystems, and maintaining or improving  soils by preventing degradation—all of   which are important in mitigating climate  impacts. To find out more, see Sustainable  Agriculture. Approximately 10-15% of our emissions come  from manufacturing. Renewable energy use  as a percentage of total electricity for the  system was 12% in 2021.1 In February 2022, we  released a Renewable Energy Implementation  Guidebook, a step-by-step guide for company- owned facilities and bottling partners to build  knowledge and increase facilities’ generation  and procurement of renewable energy. We also conducted analyses of renewable  energy opportunities in six countries where  implementation is more complex to support  our teams in identifying renewable energy  procurement options. In 2022, we will  continue to support operating units and  bottling partners to further scale their use of  renewable energy. In 2021, we also re-joined  the Clean Energy Buyers Association (formerly  known as the Renewable Energy Buyers  Alliance) and are leveraging their resources  and networks as we scale up our use of  renewable energy. Cold drink equipment and dispensing  accounts for approximately one-third of our  emissions. We are working to place more  hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free coolers, replace  older equipment with newer and more  energy efficient coolers, as well as place  more “intelligent connected” coolers that  transmit data such as product throughput,  maintenance status, temperature and energy  use, which can improve our placement and  management of coolers while reducing  emissions. Because packaging accounts for almost   one-third of our overall carbon footprint,  virtually everything we do toward our World  Without Waste initiative also helps to achieve   our science-based target. This strategy  includes more plant-based packaging that  requires less petroleum-based virgin plastic;  lightweighting our packaging; using more  reusable packaging (both traditional refillables  as well as fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle  dispensed solutions), using more recycled  material; and recycling more bottles and cans. For more about our packaging efforts, see  World Without Waste. Achieving our science-based target means looking at our full value chain, including bottling partners and  suppliers. Our target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 includes system  partners within our scope 1 and 2 boundary. Following are examples of how we are integrating our climate  initiatives across our value chain and in collaboration with system partners. 1    Due to an improvement in our data collection process  and rigorous assessment of renewable energy  claims throughout the system, this resulted in a drop  in renewable energy use as a percentage of total  electricity for the system from 17% to 12%. As part of its ongoing commitment to reducing its  carbon footprint, the fairlife facility in Coopersville,  Michigan, partnered in 2021 with Generate, a  company that builds, finances, owns and operates  sustainable infrastructure such as energy,  mobility and waste assets. In the partnership,  fairlife sends the liquid waste and organic matter  waste produced during manufacturing at the  facility to Generate’s anaerobic digester about 30  miles away in Fremont. The waste is broken down  in the digester, and the resulting biogas that is  produced is used to generate electricity. While  there are CO2 emissions associated with this  approach, the net GHG emissions are much lower  than if the organic waste had been sent to landfill  where it would contribute to methane emissions,  which have a warming potential 28-34 times that  of CO2.1  
Between November 2021 and February 2022,  the Coopersville plant has diverted 753 tons of  organic waste, preventing the release of 461 tons  of greenhouse gases. This has produced over   1 million kWh of electricity and more than 175,000  gallons of organic fertilizer. Because approximately 85% of our total carbon  emissions come from things we buy, and not what we  do in our direct operations, engaging with suppliers is  critical to achieving our science-based target. Our recent  efforts include: 
•  Each year we encourage key suppliers to disclose to  CDP’s supply chain Climate Change questionnaire,  which provides us with useful data on the GHG  emissions in our supply chain and information  on supplier targets and initiatives to reduce their  emissions. In 2021, we requested 442 suppliers  (up from 149 in 2020) to disclose, and 75% of these  suppliers responded. •  We are proud to have been recognized by CDP as a  2021 Supplier Engagement leader for the third year  in a row. This is an acknowledgement of our efforts to  measure and reduce climate risks within our supply  chain. We join the top 8% of companies who disclosed  to CDP's full Climate Change questionnaire. •  We have piloted a questionnaire with 12 of our major  suppliers across ingredients and packaging to begin  moving toward supplier-specific emissions factors for  the commodities we procure. This allows us to better  understand our supply chain and more accurately track  the emissions reductions of specific suppliers in key  areas of our supply chain. •  In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on  Climate Transition initiative along with Atlantic  Packaging, The Estée Lauder Companies, General  Mills, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Keurig Dr Pepper, Restaurant  Brands International, Mars Incorporated, McCormick  & Company, Mondelēz International, and Yum! Brands  to mobilize collective climate action by providing  suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to  support their climate journey. We are witnessing the impacts of changing weather  patterns, which is why investing in the resilience of our  supply chain and the communities where we operate is  critical to our long-term success. Our work on resilience  helps ensure we can withstand, recover from and adapt  to the shocks and stressors of a changing climate. Many of our climate resilience efforts relate to our  ingredient supply chain and water stewardship. For more  information, see our Sustainable Agriculture and Water  sections, as well as our featured story about resilience   in action. We are also sharing the outputs of our work on climate  resilience with peer companies. As founding members of  the BSR Climate Risk to Resilience platform, we helped  shape the development of resilience metrics and risk  planning tools as well as the report Rising to Resilience  (produced in collaboration with WWF and published  in November 2020). This report provides practical  application for businesses on how to integrate climate  resilience into their water stewardship strategies. Accurately measuring our impact and tracking reductions  is essential to achieving our climate goal. We’ve  recently implemented a new data system for collecting  sustainability metrics and continually work toward  ensuring that our practices are industry-leading. In 2021,  we took significant steps to help facilitate complete and  accurate progress reporting against our science-based  target. We updated our GHG emissions accounting  methodology for the Coca-Cola system aligned with the  GHG Protocol and undertook an assessment to evaluate  and expand the emissions sources included within our  reporting boundary to align with requirements of the  Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, we  plan to track our target progress in real-time across the  system, putting us in a strong position to publicly report  on progress against our target next year. Across our system, many of our bottling and supplier  partners have set their own science-based targets or  have goals for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or  sooner. In December 2021, the Coca-Cola system in Europe  announced a goal to reach net zero by 2040 across all  European markets, covering the entire European value  chain, building on net zero and science-based targets  set by The Coca-Cola Company’s two leading bottling  partners in Europe, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and  Coca-Cola HBC. This effort seeks a reduction of 2.5  million tons of CO2 equivalent annually in Europe by 2030  compared to 2015—a reduction of 30%. Complementing these net zero commitments, several   of our other bottling partners have also announced their  own science-based targets, including Swire Coca-Cola  Limited (Asia) and Coca-Cola FEMSA (Mexico). Coca-Cola Europacific Partners completed Phase  1 of a three-phase solar development project at  their facility in Wakefield, UK, the largest soft  drinks plant in Europe. The early results are  promising, already saving £340,000 in 2021 with  installation of an 8.2 megawatt solar system  that accounts for almost 20% of the facility’s  electricity consumption. By the completion of  Phase 3, we expect that the project will generate  an additional 30 megawatts in solar energy and  include up to 40 megawatts of battery storage  capacity, ultimately transitioning the facility to  be carbon neutral by 2050. We rely on agricultural ingredients to   make and package our beverages. Ensuring  these ingredients are sustainably sourced   is a key priority for us, and is essential to our  efforts on climate resilience, water security,  human rights, sustainable packaging and  economic empowerment. As climate change  leads to more extreme weather and increased  water stress, more sustainable agricultural  practices will play a vital role in promoting  resilience across our supply chain and   in the communities that produce our  agricultural ingredients. The quality and integrity of our products depends on a secure,  sustainable supply chain with successful and thriving farming  communities. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) advance  and standardize our core values at the farm level—from small-scale  farmer cooperatives to large commercial operations—supporting  livelihoods and helping to ensure continuity of supply. Introduced in 2021 to improve upon our previous  sustainable agriculture framework, the PSA aim to  strengthen our progress toward sustainable sourcing of  agricultural ingredients, taking a longer-term perspective  that reflects our expanding portfolio, increasingly diverse  supply chains and the most recent science. The principles  are designed to help farms become more productive,  resilient, transparent and compliant. Working with   our suppliers, we seek to advance on-farm practices   and thereby create long-term, systemic change in our  supply chains. More sustainable farming practices lead to improved  farm incomes, through higher crop yields, better  management, reduced costs and increased resilience   to changing weather patterns—as well as enhanced  product quality and a more stable supply. The PSA are designed to encourage continuous  improvement of farming practices. Recognizing the  diversity of supply chains, farm structures and risk  contexts, the PSA introduced a new framework for  evaluating compliance and performance of our supply  farm base to reflect the on-the-ground realities in  sustainable farming practices. The PSA’s “Leader/Mover/Improver” framework helps us  to catalog our ingredient supply into three performance  categories so we can prioritize our actions in line  with our company’s highest sustainability priorities,  including climate change, water resources, ecosystems  and biodiversity, human rights, and animal health and  welfare. These categories are: 
LEADER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume  is verified to a TCCC approved, third-party validation  aligned with the PSA.1 
MOVER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume  is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming  standard(s), effectively identifying and addressing key  sustainability issues and advancing sustainable practices. IMPROVER LEVEL, which applies when the supply  volume is sourced from smallholder/small-scale  producers participating in a support program and  continuously improving practices to address their priority  sustainability issues over time. We are currently in the process of mapping the volume of  the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against this  framework. This mapping will form the basis for how we  engage with suppliers to drive continuous improvement  in line with our Leader-Mover-Improver framework. •  All of our agricultural-based suppliers will demonstrate  continuous improvement and will be categorized by  The Coca-Cola Company as either Leaders, Movers or  Improvers. •  All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and   their farm supply base will achieve “Leader” status  over time. 1   These approved standards, which can be found on our website,  currently include Bonsucro for sugar; the Sustainable Agriculture  Initiative Platform—Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) for crops  including cane sugar, beet sugar and fruit; the Round Table for  Responsible Soy for soybean; the Rainforest Alliance for coffee and  tea; the Forest Stewardship Council for pulp and paper; and Field  to Market for U.S. corn, among others. Certain third-party validation  programs under the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles  (SAGP)—our previous framework that was in effect from 2013 to  2020—are still in the process of being evaluated for use under the  PSA. Once this benchmarking process has been completed, the list  of approved verifications will be updated. We source a significant volume of oranges from  Florida—but in 2020, none of our supply had   been verified by an approved sustainable  agriculture program. We approached the  Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform  (SAI Platform) and asked for their support to  engage Florida orange growers on the topic of  sustainability. The resulting project, known as the  Florida Orange Sustainability FSA Accelerator,  brought together 14 companies aligned around  the same goal: to increase the volume of  sustainable oranges grown in Florida. Together,  the SAI Platform created consensus across the  orange-processing industry, supporting growers  in implementing more sustainable practices— and communicating the sustainable practices  they were already employing. Our volume of  sustainably sourced Florida oranges jumped  significantly, from 0% in 2020 to 41% in 2021, and  we expect the percentage to continue to grow. In India, the majority of farmers are smallholders  who often lack the ability to verify their  production against global standards. We have  been driving several initiatives to help small- scale sugar cane and fruit farmers improve  productivity, increase profitability and become  more resilient. The sustainable agriculture  project Meetha Sona Unnati began in 2016 with  investments in sugar cane farmers in the state  of Uttar Pradesh. It proved so successful that,  together with our partners, we expanded it to the  state of Karnataka. Under the flagship program  Fruit Circular Economy we have extended these  projects for growers of mangoes, oranges, apples,  lychee and grapes—all crops that are important  to our beverage production. To date, these  programs have trained a combined total of more  than 150,000 farmers in sustainable agricultural  practices, including ultra-high-density plantation  and drip irrigation. We track progress against our sustainable sourcing goal for 12 global priority ingredients (cane sugar, mango,  grape, orange, apple, corn, lemon, beet sugar, tea, pulp & paper, coffee and soybean), which represent about   80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases. In 2021, following the launch of our PSA, we  benchmarked over 500 suppliers in more than 115 countries and territories to begin mapping our global priority  ingredient volumes against this new framework and establish a baseline. 58% of our priority ingredient volumes  were sourced sustainably from suppliers using third-party validation programs already approved under the   PSA, effective 2021. This means they met the ""Leader"" level in our PSA framework. We have made significant  progress with our suppliers to validate or verify the farms where our ingredients are grown. We recognize,  however, that sustainable agriculture is not a fixed destination but a long-term process that requires ongoing  engagement between our business and our supply chains. In 2016 and 2017, The Nature Conservancy (TNC)  and The Coca-Cola Company partnered with  producers in the Big Pine Creek watershed in  Indiana to establish cover crops on 2,660 acres  of farmland.1 Producers planted a cereal rye cover  crop outside the growing season of the main  crops of corn and soybean, which are planted in  rotation. When planted over several years, cover  crops improve the overall health and water- holding capacity of soils,2 sequester carbon and  reduce soil erosion and runoff.3 Following this  initial investment and support, many farmers have  continued to plant cover crops each year using  their own funds. In 2021, out of the original 2,660  acres that were supported, a total of 1,264 acres  of cover crops were planted.1 The total estimated  decrease in runoff associated with the planting of  these cover crops is 484 million liters per year.4  The decrease in sediment erosion is estimated at  2,001 metric tons per year.4 
Smallholder farmers often face major challenges  in having their production validated by a third  party. So in 2019, we launched the “Fruto  Resiliente” project with a goal of improving  the farming practices of 480 smallholder  orange growers in the Brazilian citrus belt by  the end of 2023, with at least 50% of them  reaching the equivalent of bronze level of the  SAI FSA standard. The project is a collaborative  partnership between The Coca-Cola Company,  The Coca-Cola Foundation, innocent, Solidaridad,  Cutrale (our largest orange juice supplier in Brazil),  and Eckes Granini (a leading supplier of fruit juices  and beverages). As of December 2021, the project  had reached 800 orange growers through the  dissemination of information using digital tools  such as messaging apps, videos and live streams,  and a website where farmers can download  training manuals, booklets, etc. The project also  included more than 300 visits by agriculture  extension workers, who provide advisory services  to farms and tailored action plans, and a signed  partnership agreement with the Sylvio Moreira  Citriculture Center (CCSM) of the Campinas  Agronomic Institute (IAC). The project will utilize  CCSM/IAC's demonstration farm to showcase   and demonstrate sustainable agricultural  practices to farmers. The project’s goal for 2022  is to improve the agricultural practices of at   least 200 orange farmers. 2    The Ohio State University Extension. 2009. Using Cover Crops to  Convert to No-till. Fact Sheet Agriculture and Natural Resources. SAG-11-09, AEX-540-09, ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/SAG-11                          
This bar graph shows progress  toward total sustainable sourcing  of all 12 global priority ingredients,  combined, using third-party validation  programs approved under our PSA,  effective 2021, alongside progress  against our previous SAGP, effective  2013-2020. The company is working  to finalize our benchmarking of  third-party validation against the  PSA standard, including verifications  accepted under the SAGP for which  benchmarking continues in 2022. We anticipate resumption of data  reporting for individual priority  ingredients once we have completed  our benchmarking exercise. By restoring and rebuilding degraded soils,  regenerative agricultural practices can conserve  and rehabilitate farmland, increase biodiversity  and yield, build resilience to climate change  and improve the water cycle. Many of our water  replenishment programs promote regenerative  farming practices such as no-till/reduced/ conservation tillage, precision agriculture, edge  of field practices, crop rotations, the use of cover  crops and efficient use of fertilizers/compost. In Turkey, for example, we have been working  in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture  and Forestry General Directorate of Agricultural  Reform and the Nature Conservation Centre to  introduce regenerative agricultural practices in  Konya province. Begun in 2013 on 125 hectares,  the project expanded these practices to more  than 3,500 hectares of farmland. Regenerative  agricultural practices have resulted in an  estimated increase in soil organic matter of at  least 30%, an increase in soil moisture content of  10%, and a reduction in required irrigation of 10%  during the growing season. As a founding member of the SAI Platform's  Regenerative Agricultural Programme,  which aims to set an industry benchmark  for measuring outcomes at the farm level,  we are collaborating pre-competitively with  industry peers and suppliers to promote and  implement regenerative agricultural practices,  by supporting the development of tools and  guidance documents to build farmer capacity. We also continue to be actively involved with  SAI Platform’s work on Farm Sustainability  Assessment (FSA), which helps drive relevant  and demonstrable continuous improvement of  on-farm environmental, social and economic  performance through supply chain collaboration  and fostering a common understanding of  sustainable agriculture. To make the biggest impacts, we aim to collaborate   with suppliers to engage the farmers in their supply  chains to help them improve performance. This is  because The Coca-Cola Company buys our ingredients  from suppliers that purchase agricultural raw materials  directly from farms or through intermediaries. All agricultural-based ingredient and packaging suppliers  are informed of our PSA, with clear expectations on  making measurable progress in meeting our PSA (on the  farms where raw materials for our products are grown),  set out through sourcing contracts and other supplier  communications. Through our Principles for Sustainable  Agriculture (PSA)-Supplier Guide, we provide guidance to  suppliers on implementation of the PSA. •  Training and extension services to farmers to  implement more sustainable practices that enhance  quality, productivity and farmer incomes. In addition, suppliers of global priority ingredients   are required to provide annual letters of attestation  detailing the percentage of volume of ingredients sold   to us that comply with our PSA. These letters must  specify countries of origin and the relevant verifications   and standards that have been met. As much as 60% of the sugar produced in China  comes from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region (Guangxi), in an area that suffers from  both droughts and floods. To help address this  challenge, we have been working with The Coca- Cola Foundation, the United Nations Development  Program (UNDP) and the China International  Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges  (CICETE) over the last decade to help increase  the production of sugar cane while reducing  water use. This has been done by promoting  drip irrigation systems and the use of treated  wastewater from nearby sugar mills for irrigation. The project is a great example of scaling up: it  started with direct support by project partners  on ~200 hectares in 2011-2013. Through the  demonstration of the benefits of taking this new  sustainable agriculture approach, the Chinese  local government supported the project’s  replication and expansion to an additional 6,500  hectares in 2013 before leading to a full-scale  rollout across the entire sugar cane sector in  Guangxi. As of January 2021, a total of ~350,000  hectares have benefited from agricultural  practices piloted by the program, both in Guangxi  and neighboring provinces. Our comprehensive enterprise Water Footprint  assessment showed that 73% of our company’s total  water footprint and 92% of our freshwater footprint  is from growing the ingredients needed for our  beverages. We have, therefore, integrated ingredient  sourcing into our water security vision by unifying our  water and sustainable agriculture strategies. As we explore ways to address water use in our  agriculture supply chain, we are focusing on two main  tracks, similar to the approach we have taken for  operational water use in our production facilities:   
•  Actions we take to promote advanced water  management practices for our global priority  ingredients grown in water-stressed regions. •  Actions we take to improve overall watershed  health in priority sourcing regions where our global  priority ingredients are grown. In 2021 we began developing a Water-Agriculture  guidebook to outline a prioritization framework  of global priority agricultural ingredients with the  highest water dependency and risk, priority sourcing  watersheds and relevant suppliers. The guidebook  will provide a system-wide action plan that aligns  with the PSA and our water security goal. Our people and culture initiatives are critical business priorities, and we  strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and retains high- performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our  journey to refresh the world and make a difference. We believe each one of us has the power to make a difference, and our  company and The Coca-Cola Foundation have a long history of investing in  programs and activities that improve lives. We value how we work as much as what we achieve, emphasizing  inclusivity, empowerment, curiosity and agility. We champion diversity,  equity and inclusion by building a workforce as diverse as the consumers  we serve. And we use our global scale to be a force for progress and   for good. Our company’s impacts on people extend well beyond our own business. We are committed to caring for those who make our success possible,  whether through respecting human rights across our operations and  supply chain, empowering access to equal opportunities, supporting more  sustainable agriculture practices, or giving back to communities through  our philanthropic initiatives. The Coca-Cola Company’s policies and practices are aligned with the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which we have  supported since their inception in 2011. We work to embed respect for human rights across our system through a comprehensive framework of  policies, stakeholder engagement, due diligence and remediation. In line with the UN Guiding Principles, we carry out  human rights due diligence across our value chain. We  regularly assess our key human rights risks and ensure  that we are taking steps to identify and address them. We maintain an industry-leading global audit program  of our own operations, as well as those of our bottling  partners and Tier 1 suppliers, with over 38,000 human  rights assessments conducted since 2003. We audit  facilities using the same protocol in every market where  our system and suppliers operate. As of the end of 2021,  95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and  92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous  SGP protocols. These audit results are reviewed by  the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of  Directors on an annual basis. Despite falling short of our  ambitious goals due to the impact of COVID-19, these  results show remarkable improvement across our value  chain. We will continue to advance our human rights  strategy and work. We have also worked to extend our supplier due  diligence beyond Tier 1. For instance, we collaborate  with our Tier 1 ingredient suppliers to drive respect for  human rights within their supply chain at the farm-level  through our PSA program. And we have developed a  due diligence module specifically tailored to the unique  challenges of the informal waste collection sector and  our World Without Waste initiative. More information on  our due diligence program can be found in our Human  Rights 2022 Overview. Our Human Rights Policy captures the company’s  overall commitment to human rights. We extend these  requirements contractually to suppliers through our  Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) and our Principles for  Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), each setting clear and  strict requirements for human rights. Our approach to stakeholder engagement is an  ongoing dialogue that enables us to identify and  address potential human rights issues proactively  and collaboratively. We partner with a wide range of  stakeholders both within the Coca-Cola system and  externally across the private, public, civil society and  labor sectors, leading to continuous improvement in our  work to respect human rights. In addition to compliance audits, our company  supports bottling partner and supplier capacity  building through in-person training sessions  and the provision of human rights resources  such as checklists, toolkits and guidelines. In  2021, we conducted bottler and supplier human  rights-focused training attended by more than  1,500 participants. See our Human Rights 2022  Overview for comprehensive  disclosures of our human rights  policies, governance, due diligence,  access to remedy and grievance  mechanisms. In 2019, The Coca-Cola Company joined Harvesting the Future, a joint program  led by the Fair Labor Association in Turkey that brings together NGOs, local  government agencies, companies and sustainable agriculture platforms. The goal is to improve child protection and responsible labor recruitment for  commodities such as beet sugar, tea, apples, citrus, grapes, hazelnuts, pulses  and apricots. In Phase I, the project mapped supply chains, engaged stakeholders, trained  suppliers and labor intermediaries and assessed human rights risks, including  risks of child labor and hazardous tasks by young workers. In Phase II, which will continue until December 2023, the project is improving  conditions for young workers of legal age through a number of activities and  mechanisms such as proper contracting, age verification and training for  supplier staff. Phase II seeks to integrate child protection and remediation  systems into suppliers’ core operating procedures as well as engage with  labor intermediaries to legally register workers with the local government and  establish no child-labor clauses and decent work principles. In 2021, we began a comprehensive program review   to advance our human rights strategy for the next decade. The review includes substantial internal and external  stakeholder engagement, program benchmarking and  regulatory analysis. We look forward to engaging with  many of our stakeholders as we strive for continuous  improvement. SGP for Waste  Management New audit module to  understand and improve  the economic conditions  and practices for people  working across the waste  collection sector We’ve recently partnered with two companies to harness their  technologies to empower some of the most vulnerable members   of society who operate in different areas of our value chain   and to better identify and analyze human rights risks in labor  recruitment supply chains. In South Africa, much of the paper and packaging waste that is collected  is sold to small buy-back centers or aggregators before ultimately  reaching large recycling companies. Waste pickers involved in this  process typically lack access to formal financial services. Enter our new partnership with BanQu, which uses blockchain  technology to track, trace and ensure payment for collected recyclable  material. Our Africa operating unit is rolling out the BanQu platform  as a service to 100 buy-back centers or aggregators that buy and sell  recyclable material. The project is providing these small businesses   with free access to the BanQu system, allowing them to record their  cashless transactions in a blockchain-based system that works with   any smartphone or tablet. Waste pickers also benefit by receiving  verification of transactions via text message. These records, which are similar to a pay slip, can provide waste pickers  with the proof of economic activity necessary to access banking and  financial services as well as gain integration with the government’s  waste picker registry. Waste pickers will be able to receive and make  payments on the cashless system at low cost, avoiding the risks inherent  in handling cash. We plan to register around 10,000 waste pickers by   the end of 2022. We recently partnered with Diginex  to develop diginexLUMEN (LUMEN),  a technology-led due diligence and  governance tool that can provide greater  transparency of the labor recruitment  supply chain. LUMEN helps to identify  and prioritize human rights and labor  risks by collecting, verifying and mapping  data on recruitment and employment  practices from various sources including  workers, suppliers and labor agencies. Risk scoring is used to develop action  plans to address risks and ensure  continuous improvement in ethical  recruitment. In 2021, we piloted LUMEN at several  locations, including two bottling plants,  five supplier facilities and three labor  agencies in the United Arab Emirates   and Qatar. We are looking to expand the  use of LUMEN to more facilities in the  near future. The Coca-Cola system has a long history   of enabling the economic empowerment of  local communities where we do business. With operations in more than 200 countries  and territories and a network of more than  225 bottling partners, we partner with  entrepreneurs in markets where we operate  around the world. In 2010, we set out to address the structural inequalities and economic  barriers faced by women entrepreneurs in particular. We publicly  pledged to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million female  entrepreneurs by 2020 through our 5by20® initiative, by providing  access to business skills training, mentoring networks, financial services  and assets. Together with our public and private sector partners,  including our bottling partners and The Coca-Cola Foundation, we  exceeded our target, enabling the economic empowerment of more than  6 million women. We surpassed our economic empowerment  goal in 2020, and the Coca-Cola system  continued to drive women’s economic  empowerment initiatives across our regions   in 2021. In 2021, Coca-Cola Bangladesh partnered with the development organization United  Purpose to create 30 Women’s Business Centers where more than 30,000 women  received business skills training. Between 2015 and 2020, Coca-Cola and United  Purpose built a network of more than 70 such training centers, supporting 100,000  women with business and technology skills and putting them on the path toward  economic self-reliance. The Nigerian Bottling Company kicked  off the second phase of “Catalyst for  Change,” an economic empowerment  program coordinated in partnership with  the nonprofit Karis and Eleos Hand of  Hope Foundation, with funding from The  Coca-Cola Foundation. The project will  provide startup capital for 1,000 women  and ultimately empower 5,000 women. In the Philippines, we extended our  support of a program that offers  interest-free loans to entrepreneurs who  operate small variety stores and food  stalls. The Rebuilding Sari-Sari Stores  Through Access to Resources and Trade  (ReSTART) program, which began in  2020 in partnership with government  agencies and two leading micro-finance  institutions, has supported more than  20,000 micro and small business  owners—the majority of them women. Throughout the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic,   we have been diligent in ensuring employee safety while also  maintaining business continuity. We continue to monitor the  global landscape and risks as new variants emerge, maintaining  rigorous internal controls and following local requirements. In 2021, we strengthened our Safety & Health strategy to drive  performance across our system and reinforce safety as a key part of   our core values. We implemented a comprehensive, preventative  program to further identify and mitigate the potential for serious  incidents to occur in our facilities. Our safety program includes a set   of front-line and management responsibilities and behaviors that must  be proactively demonstrated, including guidance tools and indicators   to recognize, evaluate and ensure controls are in place to prevent   such incidents from occurring. Management commitment and strong employee engagement play an  important role in creating a safe and healthy workplace and supporting  a culture of learning and improving, and all employees are our partners  in embedding safe habits and strengthening our safety culture. We are  also promoting a learning environment by continuing to engage directly  with employees to uncover hidden safety risks and challenges and to  champion transparency. While we have been demonstrating year-over-year improvements to  our injury rates, we continue to experience preventable incidents within  our global system. We believe that one preventable serious injury is too  many, and we have processes in place to ensure our employees and  contractors report all injuries, regardless of severity. Our digital Environmental Occupational Health and Safety performance  management tools help us identify potential incidents so we can   gain insights and establish ways to prevent them. Our knowledge- sharing platform allows our operating units and bottling partners to  easily communicate information so we can learn faster, share those  learnings across the system and prevent similar incidents   from happening elsewhere. After any preventable incident occurs or had the potential to occur, we  conduct thorough learning sessions, develop corrective action plans and  share them across our system and with our Global Safety Council. A safe workplace is fundamental to our  success as a company. Our objective is  simple: Every day, the people who make and  distribute our products should leave work  as healthy and as safe as when they arrived. Inspired by our “Zero is Possible” vision, we  work to identify and control preventable  serious injuries in our system’s facilities. We regularly conduct unannounced on-site audits across our bottling operations  to validate workplace safety as well as compliance with our food safety, quality  and environmental requirements. In 2021, we reset our safety audit framework  to focus on a facility’s holistic approach to risk management and compliance. The audits, which were piloted at eight bottling plants, provided even further  understanding for how facilities are driving safe behaviors and engaging with  employees. Throughout 2021, due to travel restrictions as a result of the ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our audits were conducted virtually. 1    Global Ventures, CHI, fairlife and BODYARMOR employees are currently excluded from  our LTIR reporting. For more information, view the criteria statement. Our strategy, which incorporates social justice and  economic empowerment work, will be woven into how  we do business and function as teams—from talent  management to supply chain. At The Coca-Cola Company, we believe in equal pay  for equal work. We define pay equity as compensating  employees fairly and equitably, without regard to gender,  or race and ethnicity (globally and in the United States,  respectively). For several years, we have conducted pay equity  analyses in the United States to ensure base pay  structures are fair and to identify and address potential  issues or disparities. In 2019, we extended pay equity  analysis for gender globally. In 2021, we took a deeper  dive on pay equity, hiring an external consultant to  conduct a global pay equity audit. Given the company’s  significant organizational changes in 2021, we will  conduct a follow-up analysis in 2022. We will continue  to conduct annual analyses and are motivated by the  opportunity to build a more equitable and inclusive  culture. Read more about our pay equity philosophy. In 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee  of our Board of Directors approved plans to link ESG  performance measures to our annual and long-term  incentive programs for executives. In the annual incentive  program, we are reinforcing our commitment to DEI by  incorporating demonstrable commitments by executives  to reach goals that reflect  our 2030 aspirations to be  50% led by women globally, and, in the United States,  to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census  data across all job levels. In 2021, we developed a global social justice issue  evaluation methodology and tool in partnership with  BSR, a leading sustainability nonprofit, to help regional  public affairs and human resources leaders effectively  and consistently evaluate whether and how to engage on  social justice issues locally. We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive  workplace makes us stronger as a company, enables  us to create a better shared future for employees and  communities, empowers access to equal opportunity,  and builds belonging in our workplaces and in society. In 2021, we refreshed our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion  (DEI) strategy to expand the global reach and impact of  our programs and policies while driving accountability. The updated strategy also deepens our focus on equity  that took center stage in 2020 amidst a climate of  widespread civil unrest and global conversations about  systemic racism and inequality. We are committed to transparency and disclosure. We share diversity metrics with senior leaders on   a quarterly basis and publish representation data   by race and gender for our overall workforce and  leadership, including data submitted to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO-1  survey results), on our website. 1   Data as of December 31, 2021, for salaried and hourly employees. People of color is for U.S. workforce only. This data excludes Bottling Investments Group (BIG), Global Ventures and CHI, as well as newly acquired entities fairlife and BODYARMOR. Employee voices are critical to our efforts to enhance  cultural sensitivity and awareness in support of our  business-related diversity initiatives. Our Inclusion  Networks serve as valuable resources to employees   and to our company. These regionally structured, globally  connected employee groups help build affinity and  allyship, and they enhance our ability to recruit, retain,  engage and develop diverse talent. They also create  diverse sounding boards for business strategies and  initiatives, capturing input on potential actions through  the lens of inclusion. Since 2019, a Global Women’s Leadership Council  (GWLC)-led sponsorship program has paired  high-potential female talent from around the  world with members of the company’s executive  leadership team to help prepare them for senior  roles. The two-year initiative supports our  ambition to be 50% women-led globally by 2030  by building our leadership pipeline. Participants  gain exposure to different experiences across the  business and ongoing networking opportunities  with executive sponsors and peers. “The Coca-Cola Company is deeply  rooted in relationships, whether   it be with our bottlers, customers,  consumers or employees. Relationships  open the door to opportunity. The  GWLC sponsorship program provided  me with an opportunity to build  relationships with senior leaders,  enhancing my chance to fulfill my  aspiration to become general counsel. I am confident it will create  and enhance opportunities  for other women as well.”  
Coca-Cola Japan and five bottling partners jointly  established policies to offer the same medical  and parental leave benefits to same-sex partner  employees. Furthermore, to support LGBTIQ+  equality in Japan, we joined other Japan-based  companies to sign an open letter, written by  Human Rights Watch and a coalition of 100+ LGBT  organizations in Japan, which endorsed changes  to the laws that would prohibit discrimination  based on sexual orientation or gender identity  and contribute to an inclusive society where  everyone is treated equally. Building on contributions to social  justice organizations committed to  building understanding and driving  change, The Coca-Cola Foundation  awarded several grants in 2020-2021 to  Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI)- focused nonprofits, including: $1 million  to The Asian American Legal Defense  & Education Fund; $500,000 to Asian  Americans Advancing Justice; $250,000  to the Center for Pan Asian Community  Services; and $100,000 to the National  ACE #AAPIStrong program. Together with SAP, we are partnering with the  Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative  to establish a virtual computer lab at the Robert  W. Woodruff Library and offer internships for  students at several local Historically Black  Colleges and Universities. The initiative aims to  become the largest producer of Black graduates  with expertise and credentials in data science. “We acknowledge the disadvantages  that some smaller companies have in  competing for business opportunities  with large multinational companies. We’re excited about the potential  of this program to pioneer a more  evolved and inclusive approach to  supporting minority-owned media  companies and partners.” 
In 2021, we announced plans to nearly double our spending with  minority-owned media companies over the next three years in North  America. This means that Black, Hispanic and Asian American Pacific  Islander (AAPI)-owned and led media companies and partners will  increase to account for 8% of our total annual media budget in North  America by 2024. We achieved our stated goal of a fivefold increase in  spending with minority-owned media companies in 2021 versus 2020,  and we are on track to achieve our three-year target by 2024. Across  our supply chain, we have committed to step up spending with Black- owned enterprises by at least $500 million cumulatively by 2025. To help Black, Hispanic and AAPI media partners grow, our global  procurement team launched a pilot certification assistance program in  partnership with the Georgia Minority Supplier Development Council. We are focused on increasing the overall diversity   of our suppliers and have committed to spending   at least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers. We aspire to join the Billion Dollar Roundtable—the gold  standard of supplier diversity, currently with only   27 member companies. 1   As of 2021, we are aligning our reported spending metrics with the Roundtable’s criteria   by only including Tier 1 supplier spending. We previously combined both Tier 1 spending   (our direct suppliers) and Tier 2 spending (the amount our suppliers spend with their   diverse suppliers). In 2021, the North America operating unit (NAOU)  marketing team championed greater diversity  across all levels of its organization—from the  newly minted role of VP of Multicultural Marketing  to 19 new brand assistants. By widening the  field of candidates through the removal of the  MBA requirement, as well as creating a new  summer internship program in partnership with  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and  the National Black MBA Association, recruitment  efforts reflect our ambitions for our workforce to  mirror the communities in which we live and work. “Today’s consumers reflect a richly diverse  culture—not only of ethnicity, but also of  thought and experience. They are looking  for brands that are authentic, purpose- driven and relatable. It’s our job to reflect  the diversity of the communities we serve  and the consumers we’re trying to attract.” In 2021, our contributions included the  creation of a $20 million fund to help  stop the spread of COVID-19, including  support for distribution of vaccines and  personal protective equipment (PPE),  public awareness campaigns and more— bringing the Foundation’s total pandemic- focused funding to more than $75 million  over the last two years. The $20 million “Stop the Spread” Fund  awarded 63 grants to 56 nonprofit  partners, benefiting 30 million people  in 59 countries. Larger grants included  $3.6 million to United Way of Mumbai  to support vaccine distribution initiatives  and public awareness campaigns in 22  districts across India and $5 million in  funding to Project Last Mile to support  vaccine rollouts in eight African countries. The Coca-Cola Foundation, the independent philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola  Company, is committed to a charitable giving strategy that makes a difference   in communities around the world. In 2021, The Coca-Cola Foundation contributed  $109.2 million to approximately 350 organizations globally. We continue to invest in the well-being of Atlanta,  a city we’ve proudly called home for more than  135 years. In 2021, we awarded several major  grants to organizations in our community: 
•  $5 million to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta— the largest and only freestanding pediatric  healthcare system in Georgia—to create a  behavioral and mental health system of care  that will leverage early intervention to improve  outcomes, reduce stigma and enhance access  to prevention, diagnosis and treatment 
•  $2 million to the Robert W. Woodruff Arts  Center for expansion of community access to  the performing and visual arts and for support  of professional development for diverse artists 
•  $2 million to the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership   in support of green infrastructure projects at  two parks 
•  $1 million to support scholarships at  Morehouse College for students who are the  first in their families to attend college 
We remain committed to supporting  communities in times of crisis. In 2021, the Foundation provided more  than $7 million in funding for natural  disaster preparedness and relief—as  well as other humanitarian aid efforts. These donations supported 15 countries  and included responses to earthquakes  in Haiti and Croatia; flooding in Sudan,  Canada, Germany, China and Belgium;  tornados, winter storms and Hurricane  Ida in the United States; wildfires in  Turkey; a volcano in the Caribbean; a  super typhoon in the Philippines; and the  refugee crisis in Afghanistan. 1   This percentage was calculated based on  the company’s prior year operating income  (excluding the Bottling Investments Group  operating segment). of operating income invested   back into local communities from   The Coca-Cola Company and The  Coca-Cola Foundation in 2021—well  above our annual goal of 1%1 Project Last Mile launched in 2010 with a simple premise:   How can the private sector, and The Coca-Cola Company in particular,  share its supply chain and distribution expertise to help ensure   life-saving medicines and health services reach communities that   need them most—those in the so-called “last mile.” 
Over the last decade, our company and The Coca-Cola  Foundation have worked with a coalition of partners,  including The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis  and Malaria, the United States Agency for International  Development, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS  Relief, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to get  medicines to go the “last mile” for communities in Africa. In South Africa, for example, Project Last Mile worked  with the National Department of Health to design and  operationalize a dispensing and distribution system for  chronic illness medications, including HIV antiretroviral  treatments, that now includes 2,800 pickup points. When COVID-19 struck, Project Last Mile jumped in   to help accelerate the distribution of vaccines across   the continent with help from the Coca-Cola system,  including $5 million in grants from The Coca-Cola  Foundation since 2021. Using expertise from the Coca-Cola system, Project Last  Mile has connected government agencies with private  sector and NGO partners, offering data and strategic,  logistical and technical support to organizations and  health ministries to deliver vaccines. For example, Project  Last Mile reviewed GPS coordinates of private clinics,  pharmacies and other potential vaccination locations,  and conducted an audit of the Coca-Cola system’s dry ice  capacity to safely transport across 70 countries vaccines  that must be stored at cold temperatures. In Eswatini, Project Last Mile supported the Ministry  of Health in developing and executing their cold-chain  storage plan for 1.5 million vaccine doses. Project Last  
Mile also launched a digital social media campaign  to address myths and increase demand for COVID-19  vaccines, reaching 70% of Eswatini’s social media users  within two months. In South Africa, Project Last Mile supported small and  medium enterprises to stimulate local production of  essential COVID-19 supplies and personal protective  equipment (PPE), creating more than 400 local jobs, and  facilitated a partnership to establish “VaccStations” to  reach 42,000 people per month in areas without brick- and-mortar vaccine sites or health facilities. Project Last Mile and Coca-Cola teams have helped  health ministries promote preventative pandemic  protocols, such as hand washing and social distancing,  and drive demand for the vaccine through public  awareness campaigns targeting people living with  HIV who are especially vulnerable to the pandemic. These campaigns have reached more than 30 million  people through a combination of traditional media and  innovative communications platforms. “As more Coca-Cola teams around the world come to  understand our work, we are getting requests for insight  on how to leverage our NGO and private sector partners  to support COVID-19 efforts,” said Adrian Ristow, Project  Last Mile project director. “We’re helping them think  through how to create a model that makes it easier  to partner with government at such a critical time by  leveraging the capabilities, resources and networks of  the Coca-Cola system.” 
PROJECT LAST MILE BY THE NUMBERS SINCE 2010 12 COUNTRIES 35.6M   LIVES REACHED 6 GLOBAL PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE PARTNERS Our networked organization is comprised  of nine operating units that are focused on  regional and local execution and sit under  four geographic operating segments—Asia  Pacific; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Latin  America; and North America, plus Global  Ventures and Bottling Investments Group. This structure is supported by our Platform  Services organization and center functions,  which collectively provide global services and  expertise across a range of critical capabilities. The following pages offer a look at our  operations, their business results and some  key activities from 2021. In India, SLMG Beverages Private Limited—our largest  franchise bottling partner in India—is working toward  maximizing use of solar energy in its operations through  investments and installation of solar panels across its  facilities. The company, which has seven state-of-the-art  plants and a strong network of 1,500+ distributors in the  country, met 22% of its electricity requirement in 2021  through solar energy. The company has so far invested  $13 million on installation of solar power plants with a  combined capacity of 22 megawatts (MW). •  In 2021, Coca-Cola Japan introduced 100% recycled  PET bottles for two brands: Coca-Cola and Georgia— and 40% of the PET plastic used in Japan in 2021 was  either from recycled or renewable material. •  South Korea launched the first label-less Coca-Cola  PET plastic bottle with the iconic contour shape and  engraved logo, making the bottle easier to recycle. •  Sparkling flavors in India and Southwest Asia grew,  as local favorite brand Thums Up increased its annual  retail sales to over $1 billion. •  fairlife debuted in China through KeNiuLe, a joint- venture between The Coca-Cola Company and China  Mengniu Dairy, with plans to launch a suite of chilled  milk products. •  Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) established a  joint venture with Pact Group, Cleanaway and Asahi  Beverages to build and operate a $45 million rPET  recycling facility in Victoria, Australia. •  We collaborated with Bangladesh Petrochemical  Private Limited and our bottling partners at Abdul  Monem Limited to launch a bottle containing 10% rPET  for Kinley, one of the country’s largest bottled water  brands. The transition will remove 143 tons of virgin  plastic from circulation annually. ASEAN and South Paciﬁc Greater China and Mongolia India and Southwest Asia Japan and South Korea •  Across Europe, the Coca-Cola system delivered the  highest incremental retail value among Fast-Moving  Consumer Goods players, while gaining value share  across all categories. •  In the United Arab Emirates, we joined Project RECAPP  along with industry peers and the Ministry of Climate  Change and Environment to create the country’s first  free, door-to-door recycling service. RECAPP has built  a community of 15,000 registered users and collected  115 metric tons of recyclables. •  In December 2021, the Coca-Cola system in Europe  announced a goal to reach net zero by 2040 across all  European markets, covering the entire European value  chain, building on net zero and science-based targets  set by The Coca-Cola Company’s two leading bottling  partners in Europe: Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and  Coca-Cola HBC. This will result in a reduction of 2.5  million tons of CO2 equivalent annually in Europe by  2030 compared to 2015—a reduction of 30%. •  Coca-Cola Africa and bottling partners announced the  launch of JAMII, a sustainability platform that aims  to promote entrepreneurship opportunities through  improved access to skills training, networking and  financial access. In Nigeria, The Coca-Cola Foundation funded the  Recycling Scheme for Women and Youth Empowerment  (RESWAYE), an innovative environmental sustainability  program focused on tackling the plastic waste  challenge, strengthening the recycling infrastructure  and economically empowering women in 24 coastal  communities. To date, the plastic buy-back initiative has  recovered more than 159 tonnes of plastic waste and  empowered more than 2,000 women and youth. •  Continued adoption of refillables throughout the  region across new categories, with juice refillables up  over 50% from the prior year. More than one-third of  unit case volume was in refillable packages. •  Volume in Latin America was ahead of 2019 levels each  quarter of 2021 and sequentially improved throughout  the year. •  Coca-Cola Chile and Amulen Foundation created the  Innova Agua Fund to facilitate access to water in  communities strongly affected by drought. As a result  of this collaborative work, more than 500 families  have a safe water supply through projects such as  the collection and purification of rainwater. With this  technology, homes will be able to capture, purify and  store more than 36,000 liters per year on average. •  Coca-Cola Brazil announced an investment to improve  access to clean water with a focus on vulnerable  people and communities and to replenish the water  we use to make our products back to nature and  communities. From 2017 until 2021, the Água + Acesso  (Water & Access) program reached 390 communities in  104 cities of 10 states to positively impact more than  155,000 people. In 2021 alone, we benefited more than  20,000 people (a targeted 15% increased reach over  2020). In Mexico, we partnered with small retail customers,  six bottling partners and three local collection  organizations on the “Mi tiendita sin residuos” (“My  store without waste”) program to transform stores into  PET collection centers. Consumers can return empty  bottles to participating retail outlets to be recycled. In  addition to promoting environmental awareness in local  communities, early results show consumers are more  likely to buy our beverages in participating stores. •  The North America operating unit is participating  in a unique private-public water conservation  partnership as a member of the California Water Action  Collaborative. A water leak-detection project, which  is focused on a 183-unit low-income housing project  for seniors in central Los Angeles, is expected to save  millions of gallons of water annually. •  The Coca-Cola system in Canada supported  communities impacted by devastating flooding  and mudslides in British Columbia. The Coca-Cola  Company’s North America operating unit donated  $150,000 (CAD) toward relief efforts, and Coke Canada  Bottling distributed water to impacted communities. Coca-Cola Freestyle has introduced a new countertop  fountain drink machine to give smaller-footprint  restaurants the ability to offer more than 80 beverage  choices with the touch of a button. The Coca-Cola  Freestyle 7100 fits on countertops, allowing more  accessibility in the food industry. In 2021, we also  introduced reusable cups with microchip technology   for Coca-Cola Freestyle machines in theme parks,   on university campuses and on cruise ships in the   United States. In January 2006, our company-owned bottling operations were brought together to form the Bottling Investments  Group, or BIG. BIG ensures these operations receive the appropriate investments and expertise to foster long-term  success. Our current footprint of bottlers exists in South East and South West Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. We continue to drive strong performance within BIG while maximizing returns on our investments. •  Celebrated 50 years of Costa and were  crowned the UK’s favorite coffee shop  for the 11th consecutive year.

2  This number has been updated following the completed assurance process for the 2020 World Without Waste Report, which was completed post-publication of the 2020 Business & ESG Report. 4  In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging. These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including primary data  where it is available. Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use. 5  We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data. With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging types,  including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc. 6  Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced  into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year. Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies (approximately 80%), plant standards  (approximately 19%), or internal estimates (approximately 1%).

2  In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record. Therefore, the reported figure includes only those  allegations that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented  to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised  through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for the 2019 variance when compared to previous years. 4  This percentage was calculated based on the company’s prior year operating income (excluding the Bottling Investments operating segment).

We have reviewed The Coca-Cola Company’s Schedule  of Selected Sustainability Indicators (the “Subject  Matter”) as of (for the year ended) December 31, 2021 in  accordance with the Selected Sustainability Indicators  Criteria (the “Criteria”) (together in Exhibit A). The  Coca-Cola Company’s management is responsible for  the Subject Matter, in accordance with the Criteria. Our  responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject  Matter based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with  attestation standards established by the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C  section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation  Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review  Engagements. Those standards require that we plan  and perform our review to obtain limited assurance  about whether any material modifications should be  made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in  accordance with the Criteria. A review consists  principally of applying analytical procedures, making  inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter,  obtaining an understanding of the data management  systems and processes used to generate, aggregate  and report the Subject Matter and performing such  other procedures as we considered necessary in the  circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope  than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter  is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material  respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we  do not express such an opinion. A review also does not  provide assurance that we became aware of all  significant matters that would be disclosed in an  examination. We believe that our review provides a  reasonable basis for our conclusion. In performing our review, we have also complied with  the independence and other ethical requirements set  forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied  the Statements on Quality Control Standards  established by the AICPA. As described in Note 3 of Exhibit A, the Subject Matter   is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from  limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used  for determining such data. The selection of different but  acceptable measurement techniques can result in  materially different measurements. The precision of  different measurement techniques may also vary. The information included in The Coca-Cola Company’s  2021 Business & ESG Report, other than the Subject  Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures  applied in our review and, accordingly, we express no  conclusion on it. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material  modifications that should be made to the Schedule of  Selected Sustainability Indicators as of (for the year  ended) December 31, 2021 in order for it to be in  accordance with the Criteria.

2 Global Ventures is an operating segment that includes Costa coffee, Monster beverages, innocent juices and smoothies, and dogadan tea. 3  Starting in 2021, fatalities are no longer reported as LTIs. Fatalities that may occur are documented and governed through a separate incident management and crisis resolution process. The criteria can be found in the “Carbon Accounting Manual.” This includes manufacturing-related scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions and scope 3 CO2e emissions from franchises. Emissions from standalone (i.e., not co-located) warehouses, distribution centers and offices (based on emissions being lower than the threshold of five percent of total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) are  excluded, CO2 loss during production and AC/Chiller are excluded. Lost time incident rate The Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) represents the number of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) per 100 employees and contractors. Total LTI is multiplied by 200,000 (100 full time equivalent employees working  40 hours per week for 50 weeks) then divided by the number of hours worked for the reporting period. Scope: The scope of reporting is limited to self-reported or witness-reported data collected for TCCC and active company-owned or controlled production facilities, distribution centers, offices,  laboratories and route-to-market (fleet) operations as of December 31, 2021. Global Ventures2, CHI Limited (CHI), fairlife and BODYARMOR are excluded. The exclusion represents approximately 31% of  employees. Lost Time Incident: An LTI is a reported work-related injury or illness that results in one or more Lost Days.3 TCCC’s LTIR was determined as of March 15, 2022, for injuries occurring during the year  ended December 31, 2021 as a minor incident developing into an LTI over time could result in additional LTIs. Lost day: A Lost Day occurs when, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, the employee’s work-related injury or illness prevents the person from being able to work for one or more days. The first counted Lost Day is the first day following the injury, regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday, and ends when the person is able, in the opinion of the medical professional of record,  to return to work, leaves employment, or reaches 180 Lost Days. Hours worked: The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees. This excludes hours not worked, such as vacation, holidays, or absences. Employees and contractors: Employees and contractors include all hourly, salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of the company (as well as non-payroll contractors and temporary  employees for whom facility or fleet management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished). Uncertainties in reported LTIR: LTIR is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The number of LTIs  is based upon employees and contractors self-reporting or witnesses reporting work-related injuries or illnesses to TCCC which may be affected by culture, societal norms and/or local laws and  regulations. To the extent an LTI is not reported, it would not be included in the LTIR calculation. The Coca-Cola global business system is composed of the Coca-Cola company (TCCC) and 225 bottling partners. TCCC markets, manufactures and sells beverage concentrates and syrups and finished sparkling soft drinks and other  beverages. Our bottling partners are independent bottling operations authorized through bottler’s agreements to  prepare, package, distribute and sell finished beverages to customers and/or consumers. TCCC and its bottling partners  together are collectively known as The Coca-Cola system (TCCS), or simply “system.” 
Although the system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective, TCCC strives to positively influence  environmental activities and policies throughout the bottling system and to become more transparent by reporting  
information from both company-owned operations and the broader system. Contract manufacturers are also used   to manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola brands. TCCC provides a reasonable time period before including newly acquired facilities in the organizational boundary. This allows for the implementation of sustainability data collection policies and procedures. In general, newly acquired  facility sustainability data will be included within the first two calendar years that operational sustainability data are  available. An exception has been granted for our January 2019 acquisition of Costa Limited, which includes retail stores  and roasteries, in which additional time has been allowed due to the fundamental difference in the business model.

4  Methodology used in 2021 remains unchanged from prior years. In 2022, TCCC expects to report on water replenished in accordance with its 2030 Water Security  Strategy. 5   Sales volume is measured in number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its  bottling partners (“Coca-Cola system”) to customers as reported by TCCC and the bottlers to TCCC and disclosed in the 2021 10-K. A ‘‘unit case’’ is a unit of  measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces (5.678 liters) of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Refer to TCCC 2021 10-K for additional information regarding  the 2021 measured unit cases. 7   Material from industrial waste streams that have been diverted to recycling. Reworked or reground material within the same facility does not count towards this  category. 8  Material generated by households or facilities in their role as end-users of a product which can no longer be used for its initial intended purpose. Water replenished4  The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water Partnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the company’s annual  global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio of the volume of water safely provided to communities and to nature by the CWP portfolio divided by the sales volume of company beverage  products as disclosed in the 2021 10-K.5 Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCC’s peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable  Balance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013, or the methodology described in Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting (VWBA): A Method for Implementing  and Valuing Water Stewardship Activities (2019), which builds on the 2013 paper. There are three primary CWP project types:  1. Watershed Protection and Restoration  2. Water Access and Sanitation  3. Water for Productive Use 
While public education, awareness programs and business engagement on water policy reform are critical responses to water risks and challenges, the water replenish contributions from   such efforts cannot reliably be quantified and are not included in the water replenish indicator. As many replenish projects are co-financed with partners, TCCC claims the portion of the total water  benefits equivalent to the company’s cost share for the project. TCCC also claims the annual water benefits from each project following a benefit duration framework of up to 15 years as long as   the projects remain in productive service; benefits of reforestation and land conservation projects may be claimed for up to 20 years with documentation that ecosystem services and biodiversity   are being achieved. For individual projects with benefits greater than 5% of global sales volume, benefit caps are unchanged from 2020, which are based on 5% of global sales volume or 100% of the business unit sales  volume, whichever is greater. Water use ratio Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced. Total water used is the total of all water used by TCCS in all global production facilities and co-located  distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well and spring, surface, sea, and collected rain. This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact  and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing trucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control. This does not include return water   or non-branded bulk water donated to the community. Liters of product produced include all production, not just saleable products. Percent of recycled material used in select global primary  consumer packaging (“Recycled content”) Recycled material used in select global primary consumer packaging6 is expressed as a percent of packaging material used in manufacturing as occurring within TCCS, not within co-packing  operations. Select global primary consumer packaging includes the following for TCCS:  • Aluminum cans  • Beverage cartons (e.g., aseptic fiber packaging, including juice boxes)  • Non-refillable glass bottles  • Non-refillable PET bottles  • Refillable glass bottles   • Refillable PET bottles  • Steel cans 
Coffee cups, coffee pods, tea bags, fountain cups and cold drink cups, other (e.g., aluminum bottles and prepackaged non-refillable plastic cups) and food packaging are excluded. Recycled material is comprised of pre-consumer7 and/or post-consumer8 material. Metric tonnes of recycled material in packaging (e.g., PET, cartons, steel) is collected based on weight purchased and  received throughout the year (e.g., invoices, goods received). For glass and aluminum packaging, recycled material percentages for the year are self-reported by suppliers and applied to the packaging  footprint. In some cases, the supplier-provided percentages for the year are primary data; in other cases, the percentages are estimated or based on supplier-provided country or industry averages. When recycled content for the reporting period is not provided or is not available, zero is assumed. Packaging footprint is defined as the total packaging used, in metric tonnes, for the specific packaging type. Packaging data is calculated based upon packaging volumes delivered to facilities or  packaging entered into production in a calendar year.

The Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in  materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Percent of the equivalent bottles and cans introduced   into the market that were collected and refilled or collected  for recycling (“Collection rate”) 
Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent   of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year. Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies (approximately 80%), plant standards (approximately 19%), or internal estimates (approximately 1%). National studies are performed by external third parties such as governments, industry organizations, nongovernmental organizations, recyclers, and consultancies, which may include those engaged  by TCCC (See Note A). A plant standard9 is applied for refillable glass and PET packaging. Internal estimates are used where they are dependent on third-party (e.g., recycler or waste picker) data and  assumptions. Where data is not available, recycling rates are assumed to be zero. In addition to assessing the body performing the study to determine recycling rate, we consider the alignment of  geographic scope, sector scope, issuing data, unit of measure and timing of studies performed. Sales in units are measured for the following select primary consumer packaging types:  • Aluminum cans  • Beverage cartons (i.e., aseptic fiber packaging, including juice boxes)  • Non-refillable glass bottles  • Non-refillable PET bottles  • Pouches  • Refillable glass bottles  • Refillable PET bottles  • Steel cans  • Other (e.g., aluminum bottles and pre-packaged non-refillable plastic cups)  
Note A: Hundreds of source documents were provided by operating units and bottlers to determine collection rates. Collection rates used represent the best information at the time of publication of  this report, which is generally within three years of publication. Global gender representation The gender of global full-time, part-time and temporary active corporate employees by management level10 for TCCC is self-reported by employees in TCCC’s Human Resources system   as of December 31, 2021. Reported global corporate employees represent approximately 22% of TCCC employees as it excludes those working within the Bottlers Investment Group and Global Ventures as well as newly  acquired entities CHI, fairlife and BODYARMOR. US Ethnic/Racial representation The ethnicity/race of the full-time, part-time and temporary active TCCC corporate employees with a US work location as self-reported by employees in TCCC’s Human Resources system   as of December 31, 2021. Reported US corporate employees represent approximately 89% of the TCCC US employees as it excludes those working within the Bottlers Investment Group and Global Ventures as well as newly  acquired entities fairlife and BODYARMOR. 9   The plant standard for refillables is calculated as 1-1/n, where n is the number of uses. For refillable glass, uses are capped at n=20 or 95% collection rate. For refillable PET, uses are capped at n=5 or 80% collection rate. 10  Senior Leadership is defined as employees with Job Grades 14 and above, Middle Management as Job Grades 10-13 and Professionals as Job Grades 9 and below as recorded in the Company’s Human Resources systems. In a separate PDF document available here, we  index the contents of this report to several reporting  frameworks and standards. GRI provides a globally recognized framework for  companies to measure and communicate their  environmental, economic, social and governance  performance. We prepared this report in accordance  with the GRI Standards: Core option.

continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our On average, a Google data center   is twice as energy efficient as a  typical enterprise data center.1  
Compared with five years ago,   we now deliver around six times as  much computing power with the  same amount of electrical power. In 2020, the average annual PUE2   for our global fleet of data centers  was 1.10, compared with the industry  average of 1.593—meaning that  Google data centers use about   six times less overhead energy. Whether someone is using Google  at home or as part of an organization  running Google Cloud or Google  Workspace, all products in our Cloud  are carbon neutral—meaning that  the operational GHG emissions  associated with running workloads  on our infrastructure have been  reduced through procurement of  renewable energy and any residual  emissions have been compensated  for with high-quality carbon credits.4 
In 2020, we wiped clean and resold  nearly 8.2 million components into  the secondary market for reuse   by other organizations. From 2010 to 2020, we signed  more than 55 agreements totaling  nearly 6 GW of renewable energy,  representing a commitment of  approximately $4 billion   through 2034. In 2020, we matched 100%   of the electricity consumption of   our operations with renewable  energy purchases for the fourth  consecutive year. Google is the world’s largest   annual corporate purchaser   of renewable energy, based on  renewable electricity purchased   in megawatt-hours (MWh). From  2010 to 2020, we purchased a   total of more than 55 million MWh   of renewable energy through PPAs,  via on-site generation, and from   the electric grids where our   facilities are located. From 2010 to 2020, we made  commitments to invest nearly   $3.3 billion in renewable energy  projects with an expected combined  capacity of approximately 8.7 GW. These targeted investments   go beyond our purchases of  renewable energy for our own  operational footprint. From 2011 to 2020, our renewable  energy purchasing resulted in a  cumulative 63% reduction in our  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as  compared with a business-as-usual  scenario in which we didn’t procure  renewable energy via PPAs. Google has been carbon   neutral since 2007. Because   of our purchases of renewable  energy and procurement of   high-quality carbon credits,   we have compensated for our  operational GHG emissions. As of September 14, 2020, we had  purchased enough high-quality  carbon credits to compensate   for our entire legacy carbon  footprint since our founding,   making Google the first major  company to be carbon neutral   for its entire operating history. In 2020, we were the first major   tech company to achieve Alliance   for Water Stewardship certification   for our campuses in Mountain View  and Los Angeles, California, and  Dublin, Ireland. Our London office at 6 Pancras  Square was the first building   project in the world to receive   ILFI Zero Carbon Certification,  meaning that it was designed   and constructed and operates   with zero carbon impact. From 2014 to 2020, we   prevented a total of nearly   4.4 million kg (9.7 million lbs)   of waste in our cafés globally by  tracking pre-consumer food waste. From 2017 to 2020, we installed  more than 3,600 EV charging ports  at our offices in the United States  and Canada. From 2019 to 2020, we reduced   total transportation emissions   of Google hardware products   by 38% per metric ton shipped. Pixel 5 is designed with recycled  aluminum to reduce its carbon  footprint. The aluminum in the  enclosure is 100% recycled content.7  
From 2011 to 2020, Nest   thermostats helped customers  cumulatively save more than   65 billion kWh of energy—  enough to power all of   San Francisco’s electricity   consumption for over 11 years. In 2020 alone, Nest thermostats  helped customers save more than   18 billion kWh of energy—more  energy than Google used in 2020. On average, Nest thermostats   have proven energy savings of  10%–12% for heating and 15% for  cooling,8 which means they pay   for themselves in under two years.9  
In 2020, we expanded our take-back  program to all 32 countries where  we ship Made by Google products,  allowing customers to responsibly  recycle old and unused devices   for free—whether made by   Google or not. Google Maps provides, on   average, more than 1 billion  kilometers’ (621 million miles’)   worth of transit results per day,  helping to limit carbon emissions   by giving people access to mass  transit options, bike routes,   and traffic information. By the end of 2020, more than   400 cities worldwide were   using the Environmental Insights  Explorer, a tool that empowers   city planners and policymakers   with actionable data to help   reduce global emissions. By the end of 2020, Project   Sunroof contained data for more  than 170 million rooftops across  21,500 cities, helping users estimate  the impact and potential savings  from installing solar panels. Earth Engine has enabled tens   of thousands of active users   around the world to easily   analyze over 40 petabytes10   of freely available geospatial  information, resulting in a deeper  understanding of the planet. In 2020, Google.org launched  the Impact Challenge on Climate,  committing €10 million to fund bold  ideas that aim to use technology to  accelerate Europe’s progress toward  a greener, more resilient future. In 2020, the average annual PUE for our global fleet of  data centers was 1.10. Since 2012, our average annual   fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12, even as  demand for our products has dramatically risen. In 2020, we maintained our ISO 50001 certification   for our operational European data centers. We   were the first major internet company to achieve a  multi-site energy management system certification   to ISO 50001, which we first attained in 2013. In 2020, we purchased enough renewable energy,  from sources such as wind and solar, to match 100%  of the electricity consumption of our data centers  and offices. We were the first company of our size to  reach this milestone back in 2017, and we’ve achieved  it for four consecutive years.11  
Operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030. 2030 In 2020, on an hourly basis, 67% of our data   center electricity use was matched with regional  carbon-free sources. In 2020, we purchased enough renewable energy   and high-quality carbon credits to compensate for   all our operational GHG emissions. Google has been  carbon neutral since 2007—for 14 consecutive years. 2020 As of September 14, 2020, we had purchased enough  high-quality carbon credits to compensate for our  entire legacy carbon footprint since our founding,  making Google the first major company to be carbon  neutral for its entire operating history. Of the total parking spaces at our Bay Area  headquarters, more than 7% were designated   EV parking spaces with charging stations in 2020. Pursue the ILFI Living Building Challenge Certification  for our Charleston East and Bay View campuses—  two of Google’s first ground-up development   projects at our Bay Area headquarters. 2023 At our Charleston East campus, we’re working to  achieve the Living Building Challenge Materials Petal  (which includes Red List Free materials and net-zero  waste), and at our Bay View campus, we’re working  to achieve the Living Building Challenge Water Petal  (which includes net-positive water use). Achieve carbon neutrality for 100% of shipments   of Made by Google products to and from Google’s  direct customers by 2020. 2020 We met this target early. All shipments of Made by  Google products to and from direct customers   have been carbon neutral since October 2019. Use recycled or renewable material13 in at least   50% of plastic used across our consumer hardware   product portfolio by 2025.14  
2025 In 2020, we designed Pixel and Nest packaging to  minimize the use of plastic. The retail packaging for  the Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a (5G), and Pixel 5 use 98% paper  and fiber-based material. 2022 We met this target early. All Made by Google products  launched since 2020 are built with recycled materials.16  
Achieve UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification   at all final assembly consumer hardware manufacturing  sites by 2022. 2022 In 2020, we achieved certification to the UL 2799 Zero  Waste to Landfill certification standard for several final  assembly manufacturing sites. Help more than 500 cities and local governments  globally reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of   carbon emissions annually by 2030. 2030 In 2020, cities around the world had started using the  Environmental Insights Explorer tool for their climate  action planning efforts. 2022 We’re working toward this target and now offer  multiple new ways that people can use Google  products, such as Google Maps and Google Flights,   to make more sustainable choices. 1. According to Google’s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages. 2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to  
power IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means  
3. According to the Uptime Institute’s 2020 Data Center Survey, the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.59. 4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit  
5. We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners,  
distributors, and Google Store customers. Because shipping devices to customers falls outside the scope of Google’s operations, these efforts go beyond Google’s long-standing  
6. Made by Google products are designed with 9%–68% recycled content across their respective plastic parts. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables,  
9. Independent studies showed that Nest saved people an average of 10% to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling. Using typical energy costs, we’ve estimated average savings of $131   
to $145 a year. That means the Nest Learning Thermostat can pay for itself in under two years. Individual savings are not guaranteed. 14. Minimum percentage of recycled or renewable plastic content calculated as a percentage of total plastic (by weight) in all products manufactured in 2025. The following may be  
17. Ernst & Young LLP reviewed select quantitative performance indicators for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. See the related Independent Accountants’ Review Report. Another third party verified the following emissions in prior years: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting),   
19. GHG emissions are calculated according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), developed by the World Resources  
Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories,   
20. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google’s offices and data centers. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices. The location-based  
category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and, thus, where our energy consumption occurs. The market-based category  
incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our  
21. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability   
of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. 22. Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the  
Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity  
procured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released new Scope 2  
guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differed from the Greenhouse  
24. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware  
manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s hardware includes  
25. We’ve restated our 2018 Scope 3 (other) emissions due to changes in our calculation methodology and improvements in data quality, resulting in a corresponding restatement of our  
26. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation  
methodology outlined in EcoAct’s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper to our annual average workforce in 2020 to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working  
remotely from their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for  
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0). For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2020 Independent Accountants’ Review Report. 27. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported 31. We calculate total operational emissions as the sum of Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based or market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including  
33. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper,   
10 Years of Carbon Neutrality. In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon   
34. Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method   
37. In 2019, we updated our megawatt-hour carbon intensity metric to include all of our gross Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions divided by our total energy consumption,  
38. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable and   
39. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations   
(i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the  
total volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. 40. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity’s electricity- 
consuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity’s operations are located. 41. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated using  
both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics. 42. We’ve revised total waste generated for 2019 due to a calculation error. This correction resulted in a decrease in total waste generated for 2019 from 51,617 metric tons to 48,216 metric tons. 43. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery. 44. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic. 45. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, as well as consumption and discharge. 46. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, water withdrawal was reported as water consumption. Beginning in 2019, we restated the 2016, 2017, and 2018 values as water withdrawal. 47. 2019 was the first year we disclosed gross global water consumption and gross global water discharge data; data for these indicators is not available for prior years. 49. 2018 is the first year that reflects a refinement in Green Business Certification Inc.’s methodology for determining LEED-certified office space. 50. This figure indicates the number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada, which represent the majority of our EV charging ports in those countries. We began  
51. Emissions avoided are estimated using data from the reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada only. 52. While Google’s total number of installed EV charging ports in the United States and Canada increased in 2020, the ports experienced limited use from March to December due to the  
53. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, our Google shuttle buses in the Bay Area were in operation only from January to March. 56. All ecology projects that were scheduled for completion in 2020 were delayed due to the global pandemic. 58. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that are not used to mitigate our emissions. 59. This indicator represents the expected combined capacity of contracted renewable energy projects in which we have an equity investment, even if we’re a minority owner. On the cover:  Our office at 6 Pancras Square in London. This was the first building project in the world  to receive ILFI Zero Carbon Certification."

On the cover In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ExxonMobil temporarily reconfigured manufacturing  operations in Louisiana to produce, blend, package and distribute hand sanitizer. At ExxonMobil, we strive to deliver superior results  while providing products and services that are  essential to the health and welfare of billions of people  around the world. How we achieve these results is  as important as the results themselves. That is why  we are committed to operating our businesses in a  responsible and sustainable manner, supplying   high-quality products, working to minimize  environmental impacts and supporting the  communities where we live and work. These efforts are outlined in our latest Sustainability Report  and its companion publication, the Energy & Carbon Summary,  which showcases efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Few would disagree that one of the most urgent societal  challenges we face today is addressing the risks of climate  change. How we meet the world’s demand for the energy  necessary for economic growth while mitigating the long-term  impact on our environment is key to our sustainable future. We are making progress in this area through a variety of actions  including enhancing energy efficiency across our operations,  improving leak detection and repair and increasing cogeneration  capacity at manufacturing facilities. As a result of these efforts, we expect to meet our goal to  decrease methane emissions by 15 percent and flaring by  25 percent by 2020, compared to 2016 levels. We recently  outlined a new five-year plan to further reduce greenhouse gas  emissions from our operations in support of the goals of the  Paris Agreement. We plan to reduce the intensity of our operated upstream  greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 20 percent by 2025,  compared to 2016 levels. This plan will be supported by a   40 to 50 percent decrease in methane intensity, and a   35 to 45 percent decrease in flaring intensity across our global  operations. Ultimately, we aim for industry-leading greenhouse  gas performance across our businesses by 2030. We also plan to align with the World Bank’s initiative to  eliminate routine flaring by 2030 – a continuation of the strict  flaring protocols we adopted for our U.S. unconventional  operations in 2019 – and we proposed a model regulatory  framework for our industry to mitigate methane emissions from  new and existing oil and gas operations. The steps we are taking to reduce emissions reflect  ExxonMobil’s commitment to addressing the risks of climate  change. We also continue to invest in lower-emission  technologies, such as carbon capture and advanced biofuels,  which are necessary for society to achieve its ambition for net  zero emissions by 2050. •  Taking action to help society address plastic waste in the  environment by working on advanced recycling solutions  and having no reportable plastic pellet losses for two  consecutive years; •  Achieving a historically low rate of high-consequence  injuries, extending a multiyear improvement trend  •  Increasing representation of women executives by   69 percent since 2009; •  Increasing representation of minority executives in the  United States by 80 percent since 2009; •  Contributing more than $250 million in communities  worldwide to address key needs such as health care,  disaster relief, education and economic development; •  Expanding human rights training with more than   1,800 employees across 49 countries completing   training since 2015. These actions demonstrate our commitment to responsibly  and sustainably running our businesses and the resilience and  excellence of our people who respond and adapt to   new challenges. That adaptability was critically important in responding to  the COVID-19 global pandemic. I am proud of the way our  company and our people delivered assistance to governments,  health care personnel and first responders around the world  while safely providing an uninterrupted supply of vital   energy products. We boosted production of isopropyl alcohol, the key  ingredient in hand sanitizer, and polypropylene, critical for  the manufacture of medical masks and surgical gowns. One of our U.S. manufacturing facilities even temporarily  reconfigured its operations to directly manufacture hand  sanitizer to meet increased demand. Further details on our response to the pandemic, our overall  sustainability efforts and our work to manage the risks of  climate change are included in our Sustainability Report  and Energy & Carbon Summary. I hope you find these  reports useful and informative in understanding more about  ExxonMobil’s positive contribution to society.

The Energy & Carbon Summary outlines ExxonMobil’s approach to managing climate risks,  including Board of Directors oversight, technology investments and actions to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions. It highlights the Company’s commitment to advancing sustainable, effective  solutions that address the world’s growing demand for energy and the risks of climate change. Under most third-party scenarios that meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, oil and natural  gas continue to play a significant role for decades in meeting increasing energy demand of a  growing and more prosperous global population. ExxonMobil will play an important role in meeting  society’s need for energy and at the same time is committed to supporting efforts to mitigate the  risk of climate change, as reflected in the four pillars of the Company’s climate strategy: 
•  Mitigating emissions in Company operations. •  Providing products to help customers reduce their emissions. •  Developing and deploying scalable technology solutions. •  Proactively engaging on climate-related policy. •  ExxonMobil’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined approximately 5 percent  from 2010 to 2019 due to energy efficiency improvements, and reductions in  flaring, venting and fugitive emissions. •  The Company aims for industry-leading greenhouse gas performance across its  businesses by 2030, and recently announced new emission reduction plans for  2025, which are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. •  The 2025 plans include a 15 to 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of  upstream operations compared to 2016 levels. This will be supported by a: 
•  The Company’s upstream operations also plan to align with the World Bank’s  initiative to eliminate routine flaring by 2030. •  The 2025 emission reduction plans are expected to reduce absolute greenhouse  gas emissions by an estimated 30 percent for the Company’s upstream business. Similarly, absolute flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by   40 to 50 percent. The emission reduction plans cover Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions from assets operated by the Company. ExxonMobil has a long history of responsibly meeting  society‘s evolving need for energy in a reliable and sustainable  manner. With a longstanding commitment to investments  in technology and the ingenuity of its people, the Company  is well positioned to continue to provide the energy that is  essential to improving lives around the world, while managing  the risks of climate change. •  The Company continues to engage in efforts to encourage sound and constructive policy  solutions that reduce climate-related risks across the economy at the lowest cost to  society, such as supporting the regulation of methane from new and existing sources. •  ExxonMobil is responding to product demand growth by delivering solutions that  enable customers to meet product performance requirements while reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. These products and solutions include: natural gas,  lightweight materials and packaging, and advanced fuels and lubricants. •  Recognizing climate change is a global issue that requires collaboration among  governments, private companies, consumers and other stakeholders to create  meaningful solutions, ExxonMobil has participated in the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) since its inception in 1988, is a founding member of the  Climate Leadership Council, and is part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative. •  Commercially viable technology advances are required to achieve the Paris  Agreement objectives. ExxonMobil’s sustained investment in research and  development is focused on society’s highest-emitting sectors of industrial, power  generation and commercial transportation, which together account for 80 percent  of global CO2 emissions, and for which the current solution set is insufficient. •  ExxonMobil is working to develop breakthrough solutions in areas such as carbon  capture, biofuels, hydrogen and energy-efficient process technology. •  Over the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion to  research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly  efficient operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 480 million  tonnes of CO2 emissions – the equivalent of taking 100 million passenger vehicles  off the road for a year. Strong governance is essential to the long-term viability of ExxonMobil’s business. Within the  Company’s robust governance framework, a rigorous risk-management approach is applied to  identify and address risks associated with the business. Importantly, the Board of Directors and  its various committees are highly engaged and have oversight of risk management, including as  it applies to climate. The Board regularly receives updates from internal and third-party experts  on climate science and policy, evaluates climate risk in the context of overall enterprise risk,  including other operational, strategic and financial risks, and considers the interactions among  these factors, which includes in-depth analyses by Board committees. The 2021 Energy & Carbon Summary contains additional detail on all of the areas described  above. It updates and enhances last year’s report, and includes a Frequently Asked Questions  section as well as metrics, annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission data, and a new provision of  Scope 3 emissions. ExxonMobil supports the aims of the 2015 Paris Agreement and efforts to achieve net-zero  emissions. The pillars of ExxonMobil’s climate strategy, the investments the Company is making  in lower-emission technologies, and the actions taken to reduce emissions across its operations  are consistent with these global efforts. ExxonMobil strives to deliver superior results while providing products and services that are  essential to the health and welfare of billions of people around the world. The Company is  committed to providing reliable and affordable energy to support human progress while  advancing effective solutions that address the risks of climate change. ExxonMobil is working   to be part of the solution. Plastics are important to our society and should never end up  as litter in our environment. ExxonMobil shares society’s concern about plastic waste in the environment. Plastics  provide significant sustainability benefits versus alternative materials and will continue  to play an important role in helping society mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (see  sidebar, page 13). They should not end up as litter, either in our oceans or anywhere  else in the environment. Industry, governments, nongovernmental organizations and  consumers must work collaboratively to encourage appropriate recycling, reuse and  recovery of plastic waste. Demand for plastics is increasing around the world at rates greater than GDP, due to the rapid growth in the  global middle class and the many benefits that plastics bring to society. For example, plastics help provide  for the safe production, distribution and preservation of food and water. They help reduce the weight of  automobiles to improve fuel efficiency, which enables consumers to reduce their environmental footprint. And they are critical components to many life-saving products in the medical industry, including facemasks,  shields and gowns for medical professionals treating patients with COVID-19 and other medical conditions  (see case study, page 34). Plastic waste in the environment is part of a larger issue related to global waste management infrastructure. At least 3 billion people worldwide lack access to formal waste disposal facilities. As a result, a significant  amount of solid waste makes its way into the environment. According to a 2018 estimate from the World  Bank, about 12 percent of the global municipal solid waste stream is plastic. ExxonMobil is taking action to help address plastic waste in the environment by increasing plastic recyclability  and supporting improvements in plastic waste recovery, for example, through our founding membership  in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. We are also working on advanced recycling solutions that create and  capture value from plastic waste with opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the full  life cycle of the plastic. In addition, minimizing pellet loss from our operations is integral to our commitment  to responsible operations. ExxonMobil is creating innovative products that help society reduce plastic waste by meeting consumers’  performance needs with less material, developing new materials for packaging that is more easily  recycled, and enabling customers to increase their recycled content. For example, our VistamaxxTM  performance polymers increase our customers’ ability to use recycled materials, while also improving  toughness and tear resistance. Our products can be used to make full polyethylene laminated pouches  that are more easily recyclable and can replace difficult-to-recycle conventional multilayer packaging in  non-food applications such as detergents and dishwasher pods, while retaining packaging performance  benefits. And our performance polyethylene resins enable our customers to meet their performance  needs with thinner, lighter-weight products, which require less resource. Plastics have value throughout their life cycle, including at the end of their life. Both traditional and  advanced recycling processes are needed to help society maximize the value captured from plastic waste,  but there are some limitations with traditional recycling as currently configured. Traditional mechanical recycling – grinding discarded plastic and melting it together with new plastic – is  an efficient approach where waste is well sorted and for waste products that are made predominantly  from one type of plastic. However, each time plastic is recycled via traditional processes, it loses some  of its performance benefits. In addition, it is difficult to remove contaminants from traditional recycling  processes, an important consideration for food and health care applications. Our employees monitor the production, loading and storage of plastic  pellets at all our resin-handling facilities to minimize plastic pellet loss. Advanced recycling involves breaking down plastic waste into its molecular building blocks. This approach  effectively transforms plastic waste into the raw materials that are used in the process of making   virgin-quality plastic and other valuable products. ExxonMobil believes advanced recycling is a necessary  complement to traditional recycling for several reasons: 
•  Advanced recycling enables society to capture more value from a broader range of products and  provides more flexibility in sorting and separation processes. •  There are no evident technical limitations regarding how many times a plastic product can be put  through these processes. •  Advanced recycling helps remove contaminants from used plastic. •  Advanced recycling provides opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the   full life cycle of the plastic. ExxonMobil is working on technology to help enable and accelerate large-scale advanced recycling  solutions that could address certain limitations of traditional recycling and do so in an economically  feasible way. Leveraging our expertise in research and development and molecule management, we  are developing options for integrating advanced recycling solutions at our petrochemical facilities. We  expect this will lead to more mixed and soiled plastic waste being recovered and used to make high- value raw materials safely, reliably and economically, at scale. We are doing this without diminishing our  commitment to developing products that are easier to recycle via traditional recycling methods. As economies grow, society’s commitment to waste management systems must expand to enable  the appropriate collection, sorting and processing of waste to minimize environmental impact. These  infrastructure enhancements are needed for all types of municipal solid waste, not just plastic. However,  increasing plastic recycling rates and converting plastic waste into a broad range of valuable products  could unlock value and help offset some of the costs of improvements to waste collection and   sorting infrastructure. While ExxonMobil agrees there is no place for plastic waste in the environment,  the environmental benefits of plastic are clear. Calls to replace plastic packaging  with alternative materials can often have unintended negative environmental  impacts. For example: 
According to a 2011 U.K. Environment Agency study, a cotton tote bag   would need to be used 131 times to have a lower full life cycle emissions   impact than using a typical plastic grocery bag once. A 2016 TruCost study found that substituting plastic in consumer products  packaging with alternatives that perform the same function would have nearly  four times the negative impact on the environment on a full life cycle basis. A 2018 study by the Denmark Ministry of Environment and Food concluded a  paper bag would need to be reused 43 times to have a lower impact on ozone  depletion and air and water pollution than the average plastic bag. A 2018 Franklin Associates study in the United States found the  manufacturing process for plastics packaging used almost 50 percent less  energy and 80 percent less water compared to the manufacturing process   for alternate materials. ExxonMobil was the first energy company to join The Recycling  Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing  recycling in the United States. We have committed $1.5 million  to this organization to help develop sustainable solutions and  support activities such as curbside recycling programs. The  partnership has supported more than 1,000 communities,  including 50 million homes, and has diverted 233 million pounds  of recyclable waste from landfills to recycling centers. In 2019, ExxonMobil helped launch the Alliance to End Plastic  Waste as a founding member. We worked with companies from  multiple sectors to form the world’s most significant organization  of business and nonprofit partners to help address plastic waste. The membership has since grown to nearly 50 organizations that  have collectively committed more than $1 billion to develop safe,  scalable and economically viable solutions. The Alliance aims to  accelerate additional investment by proving the effectiveness of  these solutions, particularly in countries with the highest levels  of plastic waste in the environment. For more information about  the Alliance’s projects, please visit endplasticwaste.org. In both 2018 and 2019, ExxonMobil had no reportable plastic  pellet losses. Although laws and regulations related to the  reporting of plastic pellet loss to the environment vary by  jurisdiction, we put in place a global standard across all of our  resin-handling facilities. ExxonMobil’s objective is to have zero  pellet loss to the environment. ExxonMobil is a founding member of the  Alliance to End Plastic Waste, an organization  committed to advancing potential scalable  solutions to reduce plastic waste in   the environment. Although laws and regulations related to  the reporting of plastic pellet loss to the  environment vary by jurisdiction, we put in   place a global standard across all of our   resin-handling facilities. Pellets are typically loaded into a bag, truck or railcar via a  mechanical process. Plant personnel monitor our facilities via  routine daily rounds, and if a loss of containment is discovered,  loose pellets are promptly recovered. Pellet recovery  equipment, such as skimmers and sieves, is also in place to  recover pellets captured in our water drainage systems. ExxonMobil actively participates in industry initiatives related to  pellet loss. Since 2008, we have been a member of Operation  Clean Sweep, a voluntary international industry program for  plastic manufacturing facilities that encourages the use of best  practices for pellet management and containment to reduce  pellet loss. We have incorporated Operation Clean Sweep  principles into our global Operations Integrity Management  System, which is applied at our plastics production and  handling facilities around the world and requires a regular  assessment of our procedures to ensure they are effective,  and improvement measures are implemented if needed. We  have also incorporated Operation Clean Sweep principles  into our Supplier Relationship Management process to inform  third-party logistics suppliers about our commitment, and we  encourage participation in similar programs or activities to  prevent pellet loss. In 2019, we joined Operation Clean Sweep-Blue, which  is a voluntary extension of Operation Clean Sweep in the  United States that includes enhanced commitments for the  awareness, prevention, management and reporting of plastic  pellet releases to help further reduce plastic pellet loss at  industry facilities. ExxonMobil employees worked with strategic partners and contractors from around the world to build the   Floating Production Storage and Offloading platform (FPSO) Liza Destiny in Singapore and deliver it offshore Guyana. Safety is a core value at ExxonMobil. We operate in a manner that helps protect our employees, contractors,  customers and the communities where we operate. Our approach to safety includes identifying possible risks,  implementing measures to prevent potential incidents, and educating employees and contractors about unsafe  behaviors. For 27 years, our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) has established a set of worldwide  expectations for addressing risks inherent to our business, including safety risks. Our work procedures embed  OIMS into our everyday work processes at all levels of the organization. From a Lost-Time Incident Rate (LTIR) perspective, our workforce remains significantly safer than the industry   as a whole. XTO Energy, our unconventional exploration and production unit, continued its year-on-year  improvement trend and achieved its best-ever LTIR results in 2019. Our Fuels & Lubricants and Chemical  businesses continue to outperform their respective industry benchmarks. In 2019, we enhanced our focus on defining consistent Life Saving Actions, or safeguards, for higher-consequence  work associated with lifting and rigging, and with work around mobile equipment. These actions are applicable   to day-to-day activities where ExxonMobil and industry experience has shown tragic personnel safety outcomes  still occur. ExxonMobil employees regularly attend specialized trainings, often  with local firefighters and other first responders, to help ensure  preparedness in case of an emergency. We work with our employees and contractors to understand Life Saving Actions for these   higher-consequence activities and how to verify critical, effective safeguards are in place before   the work begins and during execution. With our focus on eliminating the most serious incidents, we  extended a steady multiyear improvement trend in 2019, while also achieving a historically low rate of   high-consequence injuries. ExxonMobil has an unwavering commitment to helping protect our people, the community and the  environment by seeking to manage the risks inherent to our operations. Our Operations Integrity  Management System (OIMS) serves as the foundation for managing process safety risks and establishes  clear process safety expectations, which are distributed throughout our management systems. The  safeguards needed to protect against process safety risks are built into OIMS and integral to the way our  facilities are designed, operated and maintained. We verify and rigorously maintain these safeguards to  prevent or mitigate the consequences of a process safety event. We collaborate with our peers and industry associations to share lessons learned. For example, we are  actively engaged in the Advancing Process Safety initiative, a collaborative effort between the American  Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute. The initiative aims to improve  process safety performance across industry by sharing experiences and knowledge about process safety  events, hazard identification metrics and industry-proven practices. For 27 years, our Operations Integrity  Management System has established  a set of worldwide expectations  for addressing risks inherent to our  business, including safety risks. *Incidents include injuries and illnesses. We base our safety data on information available  at the time of publication. Workforce includes employees and contractors. Depending on  the reporting year, around 2 to 12 percent of the lost-time incidents are illness-related. ExxonMobil’s 2019 total workforce (employees and contractors) lost-time incident rate  per 200,000 work hours was 0.033, similar to our performance in 2018. In 2019, our  employee total lost-time incident rate per 200,000 work hours was 0.031 and our  contractor lost-time incident rate per 200,000 work hours was 0.034. When compared  with the American Petroleum Institute U.S. petroleum industry workforce benchmark,  ExxonMobil continues to be among the industry leaders in safety performance. *Incidents include injuries and illnesses.

When compared  with the American Petroleum Institute U.S. petroleum industry workforce benchmark,  ExxonMobil continues to be among the industry leaders in safety performance. ExxonMobil is prepared to respond to a wide array of emergency events, including natural disasters,  pandemics and operational incidents. Regardless of the size, severity or cause of an event, each  ExxonMobil facility and business unit has access to trained responders and resources. Cross-functional  teams develop and practice emergency response tactics through incident management teams and  emergency support groups around the world. This preparation enables ExxonMobil’s global operations to provide a robust response in emergency  situations to help protect the safety of people and the environment. In 2019, we carried out a Regional Response Team exercise in Egypt to demonstrate the readiness to plan  and execute real-time field deployments effectively, based on the response actions included in the Egyptian  National Oil Spill Contingency Plan. With more than 150 participants representing 27 countries, the five- day exercise strengthened alignment on response objectives between key stakeholders and the Regional  Response Team. The success of ExxonMobil’s operations depends on a healthy and competent workforce. Our health policy  communicates corporate expectations for identifying and managing health risks related to our operations. In  each country, we develop workplace health programs that consider local health care systems and health needs. Improvements in worker health can increase quality of life and employee productivity. ExxonMobil supports  voluntary health programs that promote employee well-being while reducing health-plan costs. Through our  Culture of Health program, we provide employees with health education, disease management assistance,  resilience training and fitness programs. We have implemented the Culture of Health program in 30 countries,  and we continue to look for new opportunities to expand the program’s reach. We have recently added  programs in Canada, Chad, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, France, Germany, Guam and New Caledonia. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, our emergency preparedness and response  procedures were triggered at the country, regional and facility levels, building on lessons learned from SARS,  Pandemic Flu, MERS and Ebola. Our preventive and mitigation safeguards, combined with coordinated  internal communications, helped protect the health and safety of our workers and their dependents. Where  appropriate, we implemented remote-work policies while our facilities were deep cleaned and reconfigured  to enable proper social distancing. Our measures were continually refined as more information about the virus  was identified, in consultation with internal and external health experts. Diversity of thought, ideas, perspectives, skill, knowledge and   culture makes ExxonMobil more innovative, resilient and better   able to navigate the complex and changing global energy   business. Creating an inclusive workplace enables our global  employees to bring their unique perspectives to help achieve our  business objectives. Our global workforce reflects the local communities and cultures  where we operate. Our objectives are to seek and hire talented,  dedicated employees and give them opportunities to learn, grow  and succeed. The result is a diverse and multifaceted employee  base representing different perspectives and ideas. We consider and monitor diversity through all stages of  employment, including recruitment, training and development   of our employees. For example, in 2019, 36 percent of our campus  engineering hires in the United States were women, and 40  percent were minorities. Both rates are higher than the average  annual percentage of female engineering graduates and minority  engineering graduates, respectively. Over the past decade, 39 percent of our global management,  professional and technical hires were female, and 31 percent of our  U.S. management, professional and technical hires were minorities. In 2019, 22 percent of ExxonMobil’s global executive employee  population were women, and 18 percent of our U.S. executives  were minorities. We have implemented the Culture of Health program  in 30 countries, and we continue to look for new  opportunities to expand the program’s reach. ExxonMobil actively fosters a productive work environment where individual and cultural differences are  respected and valued, and where all employees are encouraged to contribute fully to achieving business results. Our Global Diversity Framework and Standards of Business Conduct govern ExxonMobil employment  practices, including policies for recruitment, hiring, promotions and salary administration. The standards support  our commitment to provide equal employment opportunities, prohibit discrimination in the workplace and align  with applicable laws in the countries where we operate. We use a series of training programs and tools to help  our employees understand cultural sensitivities across a diverse workforce. We do not tolerate harassment in  any form, and violators of this policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. ExxonMobil prioritizes the development of employees. We begin with recruiting exceptional talent and continue  with individually planned assignments and experiences that lead to broad skill development and a deep  understanding of our businesses. This career-oriented, tailored approach results in an average length of service  of more than 30 years for career employees. It also facilitates development of the next generation of leaders  from within the company. ExxonMobil invests in people for a long-term career. Through a combination of work assignments, on-the-job  experiences, and focused training and education, employees acquire the necessary skills and competencies to  take on increasing levels of responsibility and job complexity. We have invested an average of $93 million per  year on training since 2015. In 2019, more than 60,000 personnel completed voluntary training courses. We recruit exceptional people and give them personalized career plans and  unique experiences, which leads to an average length of service of more than  30 years for career employees. Our business presence should have a positive influence on the people in the communities  where we operate. Through our livelihood support programs, we are helping to build the  capacity of communities and enhance the livelihoods of Papua New Guineans in our   project areas. ExxonMobil is committed to respecting human rights as a fundamental principle   in our operations, reinforced through training and integrated into our policies and  practices. Our business presence should have a positive influence on the people in   the communities where we operate. Our practices reflect the spirit and intent of the   United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are guided by elements of the  United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. ExxonMobil conducts human rights training to help build an understanding of human rights and an awareness  of potential human rights risks. More than 1,800 employees in applicable positions and locations across   49 countries have completed the training since 2015. We use a risk screening tool to assess potential human  rights impacts associated with our activities, and we integrate it with our Environmental, Socioeconomic and  Health Impact Assessment and Management process so risks are appropriately assessed, mitigated and tracked. Our processes for stakeholder engagement and grievance management support our integrated approach to human rights due diligence. Through our grievance management process, for example, we help provide  effective, accessible and culturally appropriate channels for individuals or communities to raise concerns,  whether through community engagements, electronic or in-person submission, or third parties such as civil  society organizations or nongovernmental organizations. We then work to manage, respond to and, ideally,  resolve issues in a timely manner, as appropriate. Our efforts to manage human rights issues reflect evolving international initiatives. We are actively involved with  IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social issues, to monitor  business and human rights trends. Our engagement also includes developing and sharing practices on human  rights due diligence and human rights supply chain management from the oil and natural gas industry and other  extractive industries. In 2019, ExxonMobil contributed to the new edition of the Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and  Gas Industry, jointly developed by IPIECA, the American Petroleum Institute, and the International Association  of Oil and Gas Producers. We were actively engaged in the development of the expanded social performance  section, which embeds human rights considerations throughout the sustainability reporting guidance. ExxonMobil’s Statement of Principles on Security and Human Rights establishes the expectation that all  business units provide security for personnel, facilities and operations in a manner that respects human rights. The framework guides our majority-owned operating affiliates on how to manage interactions with both  host government-assigned security and private security providers. It also provides guidance for documenting  allegations of human rights abuse by public or private security personnel and any incidents of inappropriate  physical force used by security providers in the protection of company assets. Depending on the nature of an  incident, our procedures include reporting to host governments. Where appropriate, our standard security services contracts include provisions requiring that personnel receive  training to understand the expectations and their responsibilities with respect to the following:  
•  ExxonMobil’s Statement of Principles on Security and Human Rights  •  Local laws and regulations •  Provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights •  International Labour Organization’s 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  •  U.N. Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials •  U.N. Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
These standard security services contract provisions require contractors to monitor, report and investigate  allegations of credible human rights abuse. Contractors are required to immediately remove any of their  personnel credibly alleged to have committed a human rights abuse. Since 2016, we have helped train nearly 29,000 security providers on the Voluntary Principles on Security  and Human Rights, a multi-stakeholder initiative that focuses on ways to maintain the safety and security  of operations while respecting human rights. Using the Voluntary Principles to train on-the-ground security  personnel can help reduce human rights risks. Since 2016, we have helped train nearly 29,000 security providers   on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Since 2015, more than 1,800 employees in applicable positions  and locations across 49 countries have completed our human  rights training module. We use a risk screening tool prior to conducting broader  Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessments  to assess potential human rights impacts. We have helped train nearly 29,000 security providers on the  Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights to reduce   human rights risks associated with security activities in communities. In some instances, host governments require ExxonMobil to engage their security forces. In these cases, we  have signed agreements with governments that include expectations for respecting human rights consistent  with the Voluntary Principles, as well as compliance with relevant local, U.N. and other security-related  frameworks. We have agreements in place in Chad, Colombia, Indonesia, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea. We developed targeted training modules in 2019 for ExxonMobil personnel in global affiliates where host  government security forces are engaged. The training focuses on our expectations for host government security  deployment, including identifying the risks of security-related human rights impacts in communities. ExxonMobil is committed to respecting human rights, and we expect the same of our suppliers. Our   Supplier Expectations include our expectations of suppliers, vendors and contractors with regards to human  rights. These expectations include references to key international human rights frameworks, such as the   United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s  1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We reiterate our expectations on human  rights to our suppliers through an annual letter to suppliers. We also comply with all relevant laws and regulations regarding human rights. For example, in compliance with  the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, we prepare an annual slavery and human trafficking statement. Also, our  annual conflict minerals filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provides disclosures regarding  supply sources of gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum. Additionally, since 2016, more than 300 procurement employees have received human rights awareness  training, tailored to procurement professionals, to help improve their understanding of human rights in the  supply chain. ExxonMobil works closely with the communities where we operate to identify and  invest in initiatives that help support their needs. We collaborate with governments  and local stakeholders to invest in programs that promote local economic growth  and help improve social conditions. ExxonMobil adds economic value to countries where we operate by employing and training local personnel  and supporting local suppliers. We also build capacity of local suppliers to increase their capabilities  and work to create a competitive local industrial base. We develop a local content plan specific to each  country or area to establish long-term economic benefits. When we hire local employees, they may  receive additional training to develop technical and leadership skills, improving their overall employability. Our development program includes training on relevant technical and vocational skills, health and safety,  environmental protection, management skills and business conduct. For example, providing opportunities for local hiring and development is a vital part of our commitment  to enhancing the economic and social benefits associated with our activities in Guyana. We apply  proven training curriculums, industry best practices and leading technology to support local workforce  development. In 2019, our affiliate’s activities in Guyana increased the total workforce to more than  3,400 employees and contractors, of which nearly 1,900 are Guyanese. Our goal is to provide Guyanese  personnel with technical and professional skills needed for existing and future operations. ExxonMobil and  our contractors provided more than 250,000 hours of training to individuals working on our projects in  Guyana in 2019. In December 2019, ExxonMobil announced oil production had started from the Liza field offshore  Guyana, a first for the country of 750,000 people. At year-end 2019, more than 50 percent of  ExxonMobil’s employees in Guyana were Guyanese. We temporarily reconfigured manufacturing operations at our facilities in Baton Rouge,  Louisiana, to give us the ability to produce, blend, package and distribute hand sanitizer. Our social investments address key needs, such as access to  health care, disaster relief, education and economic development. In 2019, we contributed $253 million to communities around the  world, which includes donations from Exxon Mobil Corporation,  our divisions and affiliates, the ExxonMobil Foundation, employee  and retiree giving through ExxonMobil’s matching gift and  volunteer programs, and disaster relief. For example, in 2019, when Cyclones Idai and Kenneth impacted  Mozambique, we provided $400,000 in emergency assistance  to support ongoing relief and recovery efforts, including the  provision of food and shelter in affected communities. We are also actively involved in worldwide support of response  efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a company with  operations around the world, our efforts have ranged from  donating personal protective equipment and supporting local  food banks, to reconfiguring our own operations to produce hand  sanitizer. Learn more in our COVID-19 case study on page 34. Our employees are passionate about engaging in their  communities, and we encourage them to contribute to the  communities where they live and work. Through our volunteer  involvement program in the United States, we provide a   $500 donation to the employee’s or retiree’s charity of choice  for every 20 hours a volunteer works, up to four times per  year. Many of our affiliates have similar volunteer programs. More than 17,000 ExxonMobil employees, retirees and their  families volunteered approximately 443,000 hours at 3,700  charitable organizations in 28 countries in 2019. More than 4,100  employees and retirees donated more than $18 million to 825  U.S. colleges and universities, as well as minority scholarship  programs. The ExxonMobil Foundation matched that amount  with more than $33.6 million in 2019. For more information on  our work with local communities, please visit our website. >$1.3B contributed to   education since 2000 Since 2000, we have contributed more than   $1.3 billion to education programs around the   world, including approximately $59 million in 2019. Since 2000, more than 125 million people have  benefited from ExxonMobil-supported programs that  focus on malaria research, education and treatment. >$120M invested in women’s  economic opportunities Since 2005, we have invested more than $120 million  to support women in more than 90 countries to fulfill  their economic potential and drive economic change in  their communities. In 2020, as part of our work to support the response to  the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily reconfigured  manufacturing operations in Louisiana to enable us to  produce up to 160,000 gallons of hand sanitizer, which  was donated to frontline workers and military personnel. In 2019, ExxonMobil contributed $253 million to communities around the world. * Total contributions include donations from Exxon Mobil Corporation, our divisions  and affiliates, the ExxonMobil Foundation, as well as employee and retiree giving through ExxonMobil’s matching gift and volunteer programs. Members of the ExxonMobil Board of Directors visited its Rotterdam, Netherlands, petrochemical complex and learned about the facility from local employees. ExxonMobil strives to uphold high ethical standards at all times and in all aspects of our  business. Our Standards of Business Conduct set the ethical conduct expectations for  our corporation and majority-owned subsidiaries. Employees must annually confirm  they have read and comply with the standards to ensure a consistent understanding. ExxonMobil requires all employees, officers, directors and those working on our behalf  to comply with all applicable laws. ExxonMobil encourages employees and contractors to ask questions, voice concerns and report any alleged  violations of company policies. In addition to our open-door communication procedures, we have several  confidential mechanisms for reporting. Employees can submit concerns through a 24-hour phone hotline or a  mailing address. We respect confidentiality, subject to legal requirements, and strictly prohibit retaliation against  any employee for submitting concerns. A hotline steering committee reviews reports of suspected violations. The board audit committee, comprising four independent, non-employee directors, oversees accounting and  internal control matters for the company, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The  board audit committee receives a quarterly report summarizing the steering committee’s findings, including any  policy violations. Confirmed violations lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. For more  information on the board audit committee, please see the company’s annual proxy statement. ExxonMobil conducts regular internal audits and self-assessments to verify the effectiveness of our control  systems and adherence to our Standards of Business Conduct. Our team of internal auditors annually reviews  approximately one-third of the corporation’s activities and processes. Internal auditors have access to all  operations, records, personnel and properties. We thoroughly investigate any suspected acts of noncompliance  with the Standards of Business Conduct. Employees in relevant job functions receive in-person training on antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-boycott, trade  sanctions and export controls soon after entering their positions, as well as every year thereafter. In 2019, nearly  24,000 employees and contractors participated in such training. ExxonMobil regularly conducts employee training, both in-person and computer- based, to help maintain adherence to our Standards of Business Conduct. ExxonMobil’s board of directors provides oversight of the corporation’s affairs. Board  members select an independent director to serve as the lead director to help ensure a  level of independence in our board leadership. Board members expect the lead director  to serve for a minimum of two years. In March 2020, the board clarified and enhanced the role of the presiding director, and renamed the role as  lead director. The lead director has broad responsibilities, including: 
•  Calls, chairs and sets the agenda for executive sessions of the non-employee directors; •  Provides feedback to the chairman; •  Chairs meetings of the board in the absence of the chairman; •  In consultation with the chairman, reviews and approves the schedule and agenda for all board meetings  and reviews associated materials distributed to the directors; •  Reviews committee meeting schedules;  •  Engages with shareholders, including on ESG-related matters, as appropriate; and •  Leads the annual performance evaluation of the board. The lead director also chairs the board affairs committee, which has authorities that include establishing the  criteria for director engagement with shareholders, overseeing independent director succession planning, and  establishing and maintaining procedures for interested parties to communicate with non-employee directors. The lead director works with the compensation committee to oversee the annual evaluation of the CEO, the  communication of resulting feedback to the CEO and the review of CEO succession plans. The board believes  shareholder interests are best served through a leadership model combining the roles of chairman of the  board and chief executive officer. At year-end 2019, nine of ExxonMobil’s 10 directors were independent as defined by New York Stock  Exchange guidelines. In 2019, the board of directors met 10 times. ExxonMobil’s directors, on average,  attended approximately 96 percent of board and committee meetings during 2019. The ExxonMobil board of directors, as of May 1, 2020. From left: Angela Braly, Kenneth Frazier,  Joseph Hooley (joined January 2020), Ursula Burns, Samuel Palmisano, Darren Woods,   Douglas Oberhelman, Steven Reinemund (since retired), William Weldon, Susan Avery   and Steven Kandarian. ExxonMobil believes the strength and effectiveness of the board  reflects the balance, experience and diversity of the individual  directors; their commitment; and the ability of the directors to  work effectively as a group in carrying out their responsibilities. The board affairs committee recommends board of director  candidates in accordance with our Guidelines for the Selection  of Non-Employee Directors. The board considers director longevity of service and experience  of great value, but recognizes the importance of director  refreshment. The average tenure of our non-employee directors  as of April 2020 was 6.1 years, below the 2019 average of S&P  500 companies of eight years. The board affairs committee  looks for highly qualified, non-employee candidates with  demonstrated leadership, competency and a commitment to  represent the interests of our shareholders. An independent  executive search firm helps identify external candidates for  consideration who have: 
•  Achieved prominence in their fields; •  A diversity of backgrounds, including gender and   racial/ethnic diversity; •  Experience and demonstrated expertise in managing large,  complex organizations such as that of chief executive  officers or senior executives of a large company or  organization with global operations; •  Expertise in financial and other risk management; •  Experience on one or more boards of significant public  organizations or nonprofit organizations; •  Expertise resulting from significant professional or  academically based scientific or research activities; and •  Experience with cyclical businesses such as commodities. The board affairs committee considers recommendations from  shareholders and board directors to help ensure the selection  process is collaborative. At year-end 2019, 44 percent of the  board’s independent directors were female and/or a   racial/ethnic minority. As a whole, the board reviews litigation and other legal matters;  political contributions, budget and policy; lobbying costs;  developments in climate science and policy; the company’s work  to project future global energy supply and demand, including the  Outlook for Energy; the Energy & Carbon Summary; stewardship  of business performance; and long-term strategic plans. The board receives updates and reviews from internal and  external experts on issues of importance to the company. The  board oversees a broad spectrum of interrelated risks, with  assistance from its committees. This integrated risk management  approach facilitates recognition and oversight of important   risk interdependencies. Sustainability-related topics typically fall under the purview of  the Public Issues and Contributions Committee. The committee  oversees operational risks, such as those relating to employee  and community safety, health and environmental performance,  including actions taken to address climate change-related   risks; security matters; and reviews and provides advice on  objectives, policies and programs related to political and   other contributions. The board, including the Public Issues and Contributions  Committee, visits an ExxonMobil operations site each year. These visits enable directors to observe and provide input  on safety, operating practices, environmental performance,  technology, products, industry and corporate standards, and  community engagement. Recently, the independent lead director, along with the full board,  provided oversight as management guided the company’s  response to the COVID-19 pandemic through a series of actions  that helped protect our employees, the communities in which  we work and people around the world. To learn more about our  COVID-19 response, please see the case study on page 34. ExxonMobil recognizes the importance of disclosing relevant payments to governments to reduce corruption,  improve government accountability and promote greater economic stability worldwide. We consider the most  successful transparency initiatives are those that: 
•  Apply to all foreign, domestic and state-owned companies; •  Protect proprietary information to promote commercial competitiveness; •  Comply with international trade conventions and treaties; and •  Do not violate host government laws or contractual obligations. ExxonMobil is an original member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global organization  that promotes the accountable management of oil, natural gas and mineral resources. Companies and  governments participating in EITI report payments and revenues, which enables EITI to reconcile any differences  between the totals and publish validated total government revenues. We actively participate at the EITI secretariat and country levels. Every year, an ExxonMobil representative serves  on the EITI board as either a primary or alternate member. ExxonMobil believes sound public policy should include input from a variety of stakeholders. We recognize  public policy decisions made at all levels of government can have significant effects on our current and future  operations. We exercise our right to support policies that promote stable investment for long-term   business viability. ExxonMobil works in countries around the world and recognizes the importance  of transparency and accountability with each of them. •  Free-market policies: A level playing field within our energy  markets is vital if consumers and families are to continue  to have access to affordable, reliable and safe energy for  homes and businesses. Preferential treatment for certain  energy sources undermines the market and raises costs for  consumers, families and businesses. •  Energy infrastructure: In the United States alone, private  investments in oil and natural gas infrastructure could exceed  $1.3 trillion by 2035, adding 1 million U.S. jobs and increasing  gross domestic product by almost $2 trillion, according to a  study conducted by global consulting firm IFC, commissioned  by the American Petroleum Institute. These infrastructure  projects create jobs and deliver energy to market, safely   and efficiently. •  Trade: ExxonMobil relies on free and fair trade agreements and  policies, including, for example, strong investment protection  provisions in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement  (USMCA). Providing a level playing field to import and export  goods and services ultimately gives consumers greater choice. •  Climate: ExxonMobil believes sound policy should address  the dual challenge of reducing the risks of climate change at  the lowest societal cost, while balancing increased demand  for affordable energy and the need to address poverty,  education, health and energy security. We work to encourage  collaboration across governments, private companies,  consumers and other stakeholders to create meaningful  solutions to address climate change. For example, we engaged  with the EU Commission, both directly and through trade  associations, on the development and adoption of the EU  methane strategy. In 2019, ExxonMobil’s U.S. federal lobbying expenses totaled  $9.75 million, as publicly reported in our filings under the  Lobbying Disclosure Act. Further information on the federal  issues ExxonMobil lobbied in the United States in 2019 is  available on our website. We also recently disclosed on our website a list of trade associations to which we paid   $100,000 or more and for which a portion of our payment   was reported to be used for lobbying. The board of directors has authorized ExxonMobil to make  political contributions to candidate committees and other  political organizations, as permitted by applicable laws in  the United States and Canada. The board annually reviews  ExxonMobil’s political contributions, as well as contributions  from the company-sponsored Political Action Committee (PAC). Internal audits of the corporation’s public and government  affairs activities routinely verify contribution amounts. Eligible employees and shareholders may participate in the  U.S. political process by contributing to a voluntary, company  sponsored, federal PAC. ExxonMobil reports PAC contributions  to the U.S. Federal Election Commission every month. In 2019, we contributed more than $253,000 to state  candidates and caucuses in eight U.S. states. During 2019,  ExxonMobil’s PAC disbursed more than $719,000 to federal  and state candidates and committees.1 Corporate political  contributions are subject to an internal review process that  requires approval from the chairman. As a large, multinational corporation with operations in nearly 50 countries worldwide, ExxonMobil was well  positioned to offer assistance to communities around the world when the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly began  spreading in early 2020. At the same time, it was important for us to keep our employees and contractors safe, while  also continuing to ensure we were providing essential energy and chemical products. The men and women of ExxonMobil responded, playing an important role in the global effort to combat the virus. We leveraged our leadership in technology and manufacturing, coupled with our culture of ingenuity and care for our  people and the communities where we work. On our offshore platforms, in our refineries, at our lubricants and chemical plants, and throughout our facilities  worldwide, our employees and contractors safely maintained critical operations. In the earliest days of the pandemic, we activated emergency response teams and implemented business continuity  plans, building on lessons learned from previous pandemics such as SARS and Ebola. ExxonMobil has comprehensive  procedures and processes that we activate to respond to emergency events. Certain aspects of our operations function 24/7. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique and challenging  circumstances, since some operations entail working and living in close proximity to others. Many of our employees  and contractors spent months at work, quarantined and isolated from their families, in order to deliver the energy  and products that are essential to society. At our offshore facilities, we worked with local governments as needed to  manage rotational crew changes safely, including chartering flights while international airports remained closed. Our preventive and mitigation safeguards, combined with coordinated internal communications, helped protect the  health and safety of our workers and their dependents. Enhanced cleaning and distancing protocols were put in place  at offices and facilities, and additional personal protective equipment was provided to employees. We continued to  refine these measures in consultation with internal and external health experts as new information about the virus  became available. To address the personal needs of employees, we deployed our workplace flexibility programs, childcare and elder care  referral services, school-transition support and peer-to-peer connection networks. We also sought to help our customers at Exxon-, Mobil- and Esso-branded service stations. For example, in the United  States and Canada, we advised our wholesalers, retailers and their service station personnel on more frequent cleaning  and sanitizing of sites – from fuel nozzles to store countertops to door handles. Further, we encouraged consumers to  use mobile payment options through our Exxon Mobil Rewards+™ app to reduce contact with surfaces at the pumps. By mid-April 2020, the need for medical masks, hospital gowns and other medical equipment and packaging  had increased significantly. We answered this demand by increasing our manufacturing capability of specialized  polypropylene at facilities in Louisiana, Texas and Singapore to enable production of hundreds of millions of  masks and tens of millions of gowns each month. At the same time, we boosted production and supply of isopropyl alcohol – a key ingredient in many disinfectant  products – to enable production of millions of bottles of hand sanitizer. We provided thousands of gallons of  isopropyl alcohol to make urgently needed disinfectant for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to  protect its officers and passengers in airports across the United States. We also answered a request from New  York state officials who needed large quantities of isopropyl alcohol to make hand sanitizer for emergency  responders, primary care health professionals, senior health centers and others. We made similar donations of  isopropyl alcohol and specialty polypropylene and polyethylene in other countries. We did our best to meet growing demand from the private sector as well. For example, we provided isopropyl  alcohol to E.T. Browne, a small, family-owned business best known for its Palmer’s® personal care products,  when it decided to repurpose its Pennsylvania factory to make medical-grade hand sanitizer for the U.S. military  and medical first responders. In late April, we went beyond production by temporarily reconfiguring manufacturing operations at our  Louisiana facilities to enable us to produce, blend, package and distribute hand sanitizer. The Federal Emergency  Management Agency distributed these supplies amongst organizations supporting COVID-19 first responders  across the United States. Additionally, we deployed our technical and logistical expertise to help solve problems associated with shortages  of personal protective equipment, which typically can only be used for short periods before having to be replaced. We collaborated with the Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry and contributed technical and product  application expertise to help support the development of masks and face shields to protect first responders,  medical caregivers and the general public in their return to work. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees worked safely to help keep vital energy and  products flowing, including isopropyl alcohol, a key ingredient in many disinfectant products. In the greater Houston area – home to more than 10,000 ExxonMobil personnel – we supported food banks,  hospitals, police and firefighters. We also partnered with the Texas Restaurant Association to support hard-hit, local  restaurants preparing thousands of meals for donation to frontline workers. In the Permian region in West Texas and New Mexico, we provided assistance to local food banks, as well as to the  Carlsbad, New Mexico, Municipal School District to support technology improvements for online education. Similar  efforts were undertaken in communities across the United States where ExxonMobil employees live and work. Outside of the United States, many affiliates and employees around the world contributed money, technical  equipment, fuel, isopropyl alcohol, specialty products and logistics assistance to support local COVID-19   relief work. For example, in Canada, our affiliate Imperial Oil Limited offered 80,000 Esso and Mobil fuel vouchers worth   $2 million to frontline nurses, paramedics and doctors as part of its Heroes Campaign. Our India affiliate partnered  with United Way Mumbai to deliver protective gear to hospitals in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. In China, we  provided lubricants needed for ambulances and the construction of hospitals, along with tens of thousands of  masks and protective suits. In Belgium, we provided monetary support to major clinical trial efforts at University Hospital Antwerp and  University Hospital Leuven, which researched potential treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19. We also worked with authorities to help slow the spread of COVID-19. In Papua New Guinea, for instance,  we offered our network of more than 50 Village Liaison Officers to help government health officials provide  information in remote areas where the company operates. These Village Liaison Officers – typically clan leaders or  councilors who inform community members about our activities and hear local concerns – helped raise awareness  of COVID-19 prevention and safety measures, as well as how to implement proper social distancing. Our work to support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic was part of our long-standing commitment  to safeguarding the health and security of our employees and the public, and to supporting the needs of the  communities in which we live and work – a commitment we have embraced throughout our company’s history. The Sustainability Report Highlights summarizes ExxonMobil’s approach  to managing our operations and describes our environmental, social  and governance performance. This report focuses on 10 key topics for  our business. For further information on all topics that are important to  ExxonMobil, please visit our website. We developed this year’s report in accordance with the reporting guidelines and indicators of  IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social issues,  the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) and the American Petroleum  Institute (API). This report focuses primarily on ExxonMobil’s operations from January 1, 2019,  through December 31, 2019, unless otherwise indicated, since full-year 2020 data were not  available at the time of publication. This report uses qualitative descriptions and quantitative metrics to describe our policies,  programs, practices and performance. Many of the standards and metrics used in preparing this  report continue to evolve and are based on management assumptions believed to be reasonable  at the time of preparation, but should not be considered guarantees. Consistent with IPIECA’s Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting,  ExxonMobil began conducting annual “materiality assessments” in 2006 to identify  environmental, social and governance issues of particular interest to our stakeholders and to  ensure our analysis reflects events and changing business priorities. The results of our assessment  help inform the development of this report. Read more about our materiality assessment. We list the material issues for the full Sustainability Report below. For the purposes of this report,  the concept of “material issues” refers to IPIECA reporting guidance on potential disclosures and  does not correspond to the concept of materiality used in the securities laws and disclosures  required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Visit our content index for a detailed  mapping of the locations of information regarding these issues. We assess our performance to support continual improvements throughout the company. Since 2011, performance data include XTO Energy information. In 2014, we started reporting our data over a 10-year period to demonstrate trends over time as part of our commitment to transparency. The reporting  guidelines and indicators of IPIECA, the International Oil and Gas Producers Association and the American Petroleum Institute Oil and Gas Industry  Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting (2015) informed which data we included in the performance table. For additional information on our  sustainability reporting, please visit our content index. 2 ExxonMobil-operated emission estimates are based on a combination of measured and estimated emissions data using best available information. Our calculations are based on industry standards and best practices, including  
guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and IPIECA. The uncertainty associated with the emission estimates depends on variation in the processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, the quality of those  
data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Changes to the estimates may be reported as updated data and/or emission methodologies become available. We work with industry, including API and IPIECA, to  
improve emission factors and methodologies. Emission estimates from non-ExxonMobil-operated facilities are included in the equity data. The data include XTO Energy performance beginning in 2011. 3 The net equity greenhouse gas emissions metric was introduced in 2011 as a replacement for the direct equity greenhouse gas metric. Information has been restated back to 2010 according to the new metric. The net equity  
greenhouse gas metric includes direct and imported greenhouse gas emissions and excludes emissions from exports (including Hong Kong Power through mid-2014). ExxonMobil reports greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity  
4 The addition of direct emissions and emissions associated with exported power and heat is equivalent to World Resources Institute (WRI) Scope 1. 6 Flaring increased in 2019 due to start-up of growth projects in the Upstream and as a result of implementing measures to comply with new regulatory requirements in Downstream and Chemical manufacturing. We anticipate

We earn fixed fees,  a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or  some combination thereof, for our seller programs. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including  startups, government agencies, and academic institutions  through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of  on-demand technology services—including compute,  storage, database, and machine learning—and other  service offerings. AWS is the world’s most comprehensive  and broadly adopted cloud platform; we sell over 200  fully featured AWS services from data centers globally. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT AMAZON CAN BE   FOUND IN OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT   AND OUR LATEST PROXY STATEMENT It is said that “good things come in threes.” For this, our  third  Sustainability Report, we are happy to share  some good news, along with the challenges we face,  around our progress toward meeting our sustainability  commitments. Now in our third year, we are able to  observe more complete data than ever before, including  trend lines of our path to decarbonization. We know all progress is not linear, and if any year  demonstrated that forecasting is difficult, it was 2020. Over  the past 12 months, our world has endured unprecedented  challenges. Everything about how we work, learn, travel,  and live was examined, revalued, and, to some extent,  upended in 2020. As change can bring about critical  reflection and collective introspection, the last year has  forced us to rethink how infrastructure and the built  environment have set in motion environmental impacts  for years to come, and we need to continue to seek new  technologies, products, and services to access the things  we need. At the same time, we must also directly confront  how systemic racism is hurting people, including how  marginalized communities face disproportionate negative  environmental impacts—and we need to do better. This is the start of a defining and decisive decade. The COVID-19 pandemic took millions of lives and  dramatically impacted our families, our customers, our  employees, and our global value chain. But it has also  brought about a moment of pause and an opportunity  to reconsider the resiliency of both humankind and  our planet, making it clear how interconnected and  interdependent we all are. By keeping the past year’s  learnings in mind, we can successfully address societal  shifts, avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and  meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Our resolve is driven by science, and the science tells us  that we have a limited window to act and stay below a  predicted 1.5-degree Celsius global temperature rise. In  2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  
told us that the world needed to move faster. At ,  we realized we needed to move faster too. This was the  beginning of The Climate Pledge—a commitment that we  co-founded with Christiana Figueres, architect of the Paris  Agreement, to be net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years  ahead of the Paris Agreement. We know that addressing the global crisis of climate  change will take a combination of big, bold commitments  and everyday actions. We know that these commitments  and actions have the power to not only stave off crisis,  but to create a more beautiful, livable, and breathable  planet, with better jobs and increased economic  development for all. plans to be at the heart of  the change, starting with actions we are taking within our  own company, and extending those solutions out to our  customers, suppliers, vendors, and sellers. We are committed to building a sustainable business  for our customers and the planet, and we’ve taken  big steps in that direction: 
 We reached 65% renewable energy across our  business in 2020 and became the world’s largest  corporate purchaser of renewable energy. We are on an  accelerated path to power our global operations with  100% renewable energy by 2025. We are electrifying our delivery vehicles and  transportation network. To date, we have delivered  more than 20 million packages to customers in electric  delivery vehicles across North America and Europe. We offer an average starting pay of over $17 per hour  in our fulfillment and logistics network, along with  industry-leading benefits for full-time employees. We are also advocating for an increase in the federal  minimum wage to $15 per hour. We set, and met, goals in 2020 to double the  representation of Black directors and vice presidents,  and we set new diversity, equity, and inclusion goals for  2021 that will further diversify our company. We cannot go this alone, nor would we want to. To  create lasting and systemic change on our planet, we  are focused on—really, borderline obsessed with— driving change beyond , and in partnership with  others. We have seen over 100 other companies join  The Climate Pledge in the last year, a number that is an  incredible testament to what this type of collaboration  can yield. The list of signatories is growing each month,  and signatories in total generate more than $1.4 trillion  in global annual revenues and have more than 5 million  employees across 25 industries and 16 countries. We  stand together in our belief that accelerating action to  achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 is the right  thing to do for our planet and our businesses. At , we are also serving as a catalyst, sending  signals to the market to drive a faster transition to a  low-carbon economy: 
 We created The Climate Pledge Fund—a $2  billion investment to support the development  of technologies and services that reduce carbon  emissions and help preserve the natural world—and  already invested in seven visionary companies. We launched the AWS Clean Energy Accelerator to help  startups working in clean energy accelerate their impact,  access additional resources, and expand their reach. We served as a founding participant of the LEAF  Coalition, a global public-private initiative that aims to  raise at least $1 billion to protect the world’s tropical  rainforests. We launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020 to help  customers find products that preserve the natural  world, and we partnered with trusted third-party  certification organizations to highlight products that  meet sustainability standards. We are relentlessly optimistic about the future. We know  that crossing the finish line won’t be easy, and there’s still  lots of exploring and inventing that needs to happen. But  with passion and partnership, we believe we can build a  better future together. Join us to go further and faster, together. As part of ’s mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric  company, we are committed to building a sustainable business for our  employees, customers, and communities. We are driving toward a net- zero carbon future where the people that support our entire value chain  are treated with dignity and respect. ’s 2020 Sustainability Report builds on our sustainability progress  over the last decade—particularly since 2019 when we co-founded The  Climate Pledge and announced our commitment to achieve net-zero  carbon emissions across our business by 2040. This report also includes  our work on a wider range of  commitments and initiatives to  support our employees, our supply chain partners, and the communities  where we operate around the world. Launched The Climate Pledge  Fund, a $2 billion investment  program to support the  development of sustainable and  decarbonizing technologies and  services, and invested in several  visionary companies 
Became the world’s largest  corporate purchaser of  renewable energy and reached  65% renewable energy across  our business 
Delivered more than  20 million packages to  customers in electric  delivery vehicles across  North America and  Europe in 2020 
Secured the naming rights  to Climate Pledge Arena and  submitted registration to  become the world’s first net- zero carbon certified arena 
Like many companies and countries that invest in long- range goals, we know that the path to achieving net- zero carbon will be challenging, perhaps not following  a linear progression from year to year. A goal of this  scale requires bold commitments and innovation to  transform our entire business over a prolonged period  of time, along with perseverance and daily actions by  business leaders. Across our company, we are laying  the groundwork for the next 20 years of accelerated  progress, starting with real-time carbon reporting  structures to equip teams with actionable data and  
help them reduce carbon emissions in every part of our  business. At the same time, we are making significant  investments in both proven and emerging technologies  to address the largest contributors to our carbon  footprint—deploying new renewable energy projects,  electrifying our fleet of delivery vehicles, retrofitting  buildings, and more. We are also helping to build a  cross-sector community of companies, organizations,  and partners through The Climate Pledge to collectively  solve the challenges of decarbonizing our economy. Our commitment to a sustainable future depends upon  the people who support our value chain each and every  day—from the factory workers who make the products  we sell, to the associates in our fulfillment centers, to  the drivers who deliver packages to our customers. We  are committed to ensuring our employees, workers,  and communities are treated with dignity and respect. While these fundamental values have been long-held  at , in 2019, we codified them into a set of  Human Rights Principles, reaffirming our commitment  to human rights and outlining our approach across  
all aspects of our business. In 2020, we built upon  this commitment initiating a human rights saliency  assessment in accordance with the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The results of this assessment help us prioritize key  areas where we have the greatest opportunity to have  a positive impact on workers and communities. We  know we have more to do, and we are committed to  continuously widening our lens to better understand  the potential human rights impacts of our business.

Established a $25 million relief fund  for partners and seasonal associates  facing financial hardship or quarantine  during the COVID-19 pandemic 
We are proud of the progress we made toward our  sustainability goals and commitments in 2020, a  year of unprecedented challenges for our world. Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, we  worked nonstop to make hundreds of changes to  our operational processes to protect the health of  our employees and communities. We invested more  than $11.5 billion in COVID-related initiatives, with  safety measures, supplies, and special benefits for our  
front-line employees. When jobs were lost during the  pandemic,  helped get people back to work:  we hired 500,000 new employees, whose jobs in  hospitality, restaurants, travel, and other industries had  been lost or furloughed. To support the communities  that we are proud to call home, we donated millions of  dollars in cash grants and in-kind contributions to local  businesses and organizations fighting the COVID-19  outbreak across the globe. In 2019,  co-founded The Climate Pledge—  a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions  across our business by 2040 and to invite others to  sign on to this new level of ambition. While ’s 2020 carbon footprint reflects the growth  of our business to meet increasing customer demand during  the COVID-19 pandemic, we made significant progress in  reducing the carbon intensity of our business activities in  2020, following our investments in large-scale, long-term  decarbonization solutions. We also saw a decrease in the  absolute emissions from purchased electricity—a result of  our investments in global renewable energy projects that  came online in 2020—despite increasing our buildings  square footage to keep pace with our business growth. Our  renewable energy investments made  the world’s  largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in 2020, and  we achieved 65% renewable energy across our operations,  up from 42% in 2019. Like many companies and countries in high growth mode,  we consider both the absolute tons of carbon in our  footprint and the change in our carbon intensity. Our carbon  intensity metric quantifies total carbon emissions, in grams  of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e), per dollar of gross  merchandise sales (GMS). It is a metric commonly used to  benchmark performance year over year, as it provides a  relative comparison between annual metrics regardless of  other changes to our business. This metric is helpful to assess  our progress toward our Climate Pledge goal of reaching  net-zero carbon by 2040, even as our business grows. While ’s business grew significantly in 2020 and  our absolute carbon emissions increased 19% during the  same period, our overall carbon intensity decreased 16%,  from 122.8 grams of CO2e per dollar of GMS in 2019 to  102.7 grams of CO2e per dollar of GMS in 2020. This carbon  intensity value is in line with the targets we are developing  through the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), the  industry leader in helping companies set science-based  
Our corporate carbon footprint quantifies the total greenhouse  gas emissions attributed to ’s direct and indirect  operational activities. We use a comprehensive, hybrid carbon  footprint approach to transform physical and financial data  into emissions measurements for ’s specific business  activities. This allows us to calculate ’s total impact  on the climate, map the largest activities contributing to this  impact, and develop meaningful carbon reduction strategies to  reach net-zero carbon emissions across our business by 2040. emissions reduction targets. joined SBTi in May  2020 and will publish our science-based targets in 2022, in  accordance with SBTi’s target setting process. This year-over-year carbon intensity comparison reflects  our early progress to decarbonize our operations as we also  continue to grow as a company. Nearly half of our carbon  intensity improvement is a result of our investments  in renewable energy and operational efficiency  enhancements. A third of this improvement reflects a shift  in customer and employee behavior due to the COVID-19  pandemic. Customers made fewer trips to our Whole Foods  
Market stores and other  physical stores in 2020  and shifted to home delivery instead, which generates  lower carbon emissions. We also saw less business travel  and employee commuting as a result of many of our  employees working from home for most of the year. We also saw a reduction in our carbon intensity at the  package fulfillment level, which measures the emissions  from our business activities to deliver packages to our  customers’ doorsteps. This calculation—measured in grams  of CO2e per package delivered—includes the emissions  generated by our fulfillment operations where items are  picked off the shelf and packages are sorted, the well-to- wheel emissions across our transportation network, and  the lifecycle emissions of the packaging we use to protect  items during transit. Similar to our overall carbon intensity  improvement, this reduction was driven by a combination  of our investments in renewable energy to power our  fulfillment facilities, efficiencies in our transportation  network to deliver packages, and reductions in the  packaging materials we use for each package. It will take several years for the carbon reduction benefits of  our investments to be fully reflected in our footprint. While  we are still in the early phase of decarbonizing our business,  we are pleased to see meaningful progress in several areas. We will continue to rapidly scale our investments in carbon  reduction solutions that have large, long-term impacts that  will move us forward on our path to net-zero carbon by  2040. As these investments become embedded across our  business, our carbon emissions will continue to decouple  from our business growth, reflected in our carbon intensity  metric. Eventually, we will reach a point where the absolute  carbon emissions of our business will drop, even as our  business itself grows. This report covers the extensive investments and efforts  we are making across  to decarbonize our business  through our Climate Pledge commitment of achieving net- zero carbon emissions by 2040. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND   TECHNOLOGY BEHIND OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT   IN OUR CARBON METHODOLOGY 
’s sustainability scientists have spent years developing  the models, tools, and metrics to measure our carbon footprint. Their detailed analysis found that shopping online consistently  generates less carbon than driving to a store, since a single  delivery van trip can take approximately 100 roundtrip car  journeys off the road on average. Our scientists developed a  model to compare the carbon intensity of ordering Whole Foods  Market groceries online versus driving to the nearest Whole  Foods Market store. The study found that, averaged across  all basket sizes, online grocery deliveries generate 43% lower  carbon emissions per item compared to shopping in stores, and  smaller basket sizes generate even greater carbon savings. The Climate Pledge is a commitment to  achieve net-zero carbon by 2040—  10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. Signatories of the Pledge form a cross-  sector community of companies,  organizations, and partners working  together to address the climate crisis and  solve the challenges of decarbonizing our  economy. Joining The Climate Pledge is an  opportunity for companies to be part of a  community of leading businesses committed  to transformational action to protect the  global economy from the disruptive risks  associated with climate change. Carbon Elimination  Implement decarbonization strategies in  line with the Paris Agreement through real  business changes and innovations, including  efficiency improvements, renewable energy,  materials reductions, and other carbon  emission elimination strategies. Credible Offsets  Neutralize any remaining emissions with  additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and  socially-beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero  annual carbon emissions by 2040. Scientists tell us that we have a limited window to make  unprecedented headway in order to limit global warming  to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. No one company or  organization can do this on its own. Everyone must do  their part in this unprecedented effort—business does  not operate in a vacuum. To drive collective, cross-sector  action, in 2019,  co-founded The Climate Pledge  with Global Optimism, on the conviction that global  businesses are responsible, accountable, and able to act  on the climate crisis. Partnering to Drive Change 
The Climate Pledge and Global Optimism are partnering  with the We Mean Business coalition and several other  organizations in the largest effort to date to mobilize the  private sector to reach net-zero carbon by 2040. This  partnership will demonstrate that corporate leaders can go  further and faster on climate action. The Climate Pledge  and We Mean Business coalition also provide resources and  support to TED Countdown, Race to Zero, and the Science  Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), urging companies to respond  to the climate crisis by setting specific, measurable targets. We’ve decided to use  our size and scale to  make a difference. If a  company with as much  physical infrastructure as  —which delivers  more than 10 billion  items a year—can meet  the Paris Agreement 10  years early, then any  company can. The Climate Pledge Fund is a corporate venture capital  fund that invests in companies that can accelerate  ’s path to meeting The Climate Pledge. launched The Climate Pledge Fund in 2020 to support  the development of sustainable and decarbonizing  technologies and services. This dedicated investment  program—with an initial $2 billion in funding—invests in  visionary companies whose products and solutions will  facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Climate Pledge Fund invests in companies  across multiple industry sectors with an initial  focus on:  
BETA Technologies: BETA Technologies is an electric  Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) company that is  building electric aircraft that can be used in cargo and  logistics. Their first aircraft, the ALIA, is capable of flying  cargo and logistics missions. is investing in a  variety of companies that can advance our path to zero- emissions package delivery.

The Climate Pledge Fund  is another important  example of how the  collaborative effort of  The Climate Pledge can  accelerate the transition  to a net-zero world. Nature-based solutions are conservation, restoration, and  improved land management activities that increase carbon  storage in areas such as forests, wetlands, peatlands, and  grasslands. Nature-based solutions provide additional  benefits to preserve the natural world, such as conserving  wildlife habitats, protecting biodiversity, improving water  quality, and reducing flood risk. All of these benefits can  enhance well-being in communities around the world. uses nature-based solutions to mitigate carbon  emissions outside of our value chain, supplementing  the carbon-reduction efforts we are driving across our  business operations. We follow scientific research to fund  initiatives that are critical to hitting the targets of the  Paris Agreement and staving off the most catastrophic  effects of climate change. We also focus on large-scale  transformations which would be unlikely to occur without  significant new investment. Right Now Climate Fund 
In 2019,  created the Right Now Climate Fund,  a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests,  wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the  Right Now Climate Fund,  is taking immediate  action to avoid and remove carbon emissions by  supporting nature-based climate solutions. Global Projects  
 identifies initiatives that create real and lasting  carbon reductions, while also empowering communities,  enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife. In 2021,  joined the LEAF (Lowering Emissions by  Accelerating Forest finance) Coalition, a global initiative of  governments and leading companies that aims to raise at  least $1 billion to protect the world’s tropical rainforests. This ambitious public-private project is designed to  accelerate climate action by providing financing to help  countries protect their tropical rainforests. The LEAF  Coalition is expected to become one of the largest  initiatives ever to protect tropical forests and support  sustainable development, and will benefit billions of  people around the world who depend on rainforests. To mobilize financing, coalition participants pay for high- quality emissions reductions from tropical and subtropical  forest countries, supporting efforts to reduce and end  deforestation. Along with  and other leading  companies, the coalition’s initial participants include the  governments of Norway, the United Kingdom, and the  United States. In 2020,  committed $10 million to support two  programs in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy. These programs, the Family Forest Carbon Program and  the Forest Carbon Co-Op Project, help family forest owners  sequester carbon across the Blue Ridge to Boreal region  of the eastern United States. Scientists at The Nature  Conservancy have identified this network of land as  disproportionately important for conserving biodiversity  and mitigating climate change. Across the U.S., more than  10 million families and individuals own 38% of forest  lands, making family forest owners critical partners in  conservation and restoration efforts. The Family Forest Carbon Program opens up carbon  credit markets to owners of small forests for the first  time. ’s support expands this program in the  Appalachians and other U.S. regions, promoting the design  of new methods to measure and verify reforestation and  forest management practices. The Forest Carbon Co-Op helps owners of mid-sized  forests use sustainable forest management and  protection measures to earn income through the carbon  credit market. ’s grant supports efforts to expand  the program in climate resilient forests across the  
As the largest funder of these programs,  is  enabling an estimated net reduction of 18.5 million  metric tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 2031,  equivalent to a year of emissions from nearly 4 million  U.S. cars. Our investment supports conservation and  sustainable land management of 4 million acres of family  forests across a 2,000-mile span of the Appalachians and  beyond. ’s support also generates local economic  opportunities by creating a new source of income for  family forest owners and rural communities that taps into  the carbon storage potential of forests. Urban Greening in Germany 
In 2020,  committed €3.75 million to The Nature  Conservancy’s Urban Greening program to help cities  promote biodiversity, reduce urban heat islands, and  improve stormwater management in the face of climate  change. With ’s support, the program launched in  Berlin’s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district in 2020 and will  expand to two additional German cities over five years. The  goal is to share a guide to urban greening with municipalities  across Europe by the end of the five-year project. Bringing together  government and private- sector resources is a  necessary step in supporting  the large-scale efforts that  must be mobilized to halt  deforestation and begin  to restore tropical and  subtropical forests. Shipment Zero is our goal to deliver 50% of  shipments with  net-zero carbon by 2030. Achieving Shipment Zero means that the  fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver customer shipments are  net-zero carbon—from the fulfillment center where an item is picked  off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode  of transportation that gets the package to the customer’s door. Shipment Zero starts with our world-class fulfillment  facilities where we stock items, process orders, and prepare  shipments for delivery to customers. A Shipment Zero  order will travel through facilities powered by 100% clean  energy from wind and solar projects that are dedicated to  serving ’s electricity needs. As of June 2021, more  than 90 of our fulfillment facilities are powered by on-site  rooftop solar installations, which generate as much as  80% of a single facility’s annual energy needs. We are also  working to optimize energy use from building operations,  using innovative robotics and conveyance systems  to minimize the energy needed to move shipments  throughout our facilities. A Shipment Zero order will ship without added   packaging or in carbon neutral packaging. Thousands  of products already qualify for delivery without  additional  boxes or packing materials through  our Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) programs, which  incentivize manufacturers to develop more sustainable  packaging solutions for online fulfillment. We are  also developing new ways to deliver customer orders  packaging-free. In more than 100 cities across India, for  example,  orders ship in their original packaging  and are transported in protective containers that  delivery drivers can reuse. Learn more about our progress  on transportation on page 32. A Shipment Zero order will be transported in an electric  delivery vehicle, or by a delivery associate on foot or  on a bicycle. We are adopting electric and alternative  delivery solutions across our network, and have made  major investments in vehicle electrification, from  the delivery vehicles themselves, to the charging  infrastructure that powers the vehicles, to the renewable  energy projects that produce clean energy. In 2020, we  delivered more than 20 million packages using electric  vehicles to customers across North America and Europe. We also leverage innovative technology to maximize  efficiency on the road and reduce delivery distances  by placing delivery stations close to large   customer populations. As part of our goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2040,   is on a path to powering our operations with  100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our  original target of 2030. In 2020, we became the world’s  largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, reaching  65% renewable energy across our business. As of June 2021,  has 232 solar and wind projects  across the globe. These projects have a combined capacity  to generate 10,000 megawatts (MW) and deliver 27 million  megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually. These projects  helped power the 24 million MWh of electricity consumed  by  in 2020 and led to a 4% reduction in our carbon  emissions from purchased electricity from 2019 to 2020. Scaling up the use of renewable energy is central to  ’s strategy to decarbonize our operations. Clean  energy sources, such as wind and solar, lessen ’s  reliance on fossil fuels to power our operations and  the services we provide to customers. We procure new  renewable energy beyond the existing grid mix through  off-site contracts for wind and solar, on-site rooftop solar  installations, and green tariffs with local utilities that result  in new projects being added to the grid. In 2020,  announced an ambitious goal to procure  new renewable energy equal to the amount of energy  consumed by all  devices, starting with Echo  devices. To understand what this goal should encompass,  we model and measure the energy consumed by our  devices in different types of use, then project their total  average global annual electricity consumption. We have  contracted the first new wind and solar farms to support  this goal, which are currently under construction and are  expected to begin operating in 2022-2023. Until then, we  are investing in renewable energy certificates that match  the quantity of electricity used by every customer’s Echo  device, based on the amount of energy we expect those  new projects to generate. As of June 2021, ’s largest  renewable energy investment is a wind  project in the Netherlands. Scheduled  for operation by 2024, this offshore  wind farm will have an overall capacity  of 759 MW. is purchasing  more than half of that capacity—a  total of 380 MW—to power our  operations in Europe. A solar farm in Pittsylvania County,  Virginia, will power ’s new  headquarters in Arlington and other   operations in the region,  including Whole Foods Market stores  and  fulfillment centers. is sharing the project with  Arlington County through a public- private partnership. has  contracted 82 MW of the new 120- MW solar farm and Arlington County  will take the remainder of the energy  generated from this project, which is  planned for completion by the first  quarter of 2022. Our first operational off-site project  in Europe is the Alcalá de Guadaíra  solar park in Spain. This solar project  provides 149 MW of renewable energy  for  logistics facilities and AWS  data centers in Spain, equivalent to the  energy needed to supply more than  30,000 Spanish homes. Our first renewable energy project  in Singapore is a 62-MW system of  ground-mounted solar panels. This  system allows for the solar panels to  be optimally positioned to capture  sun exposure as weather conditions  change. Upon its completion in 2022,  the project is expected to generate  80,000 MWh of clean energy annually,  enough to power more than 10,000  homes in Singapore. In 2019, we installed the largest  rooftop solar array in the state of  Colorado at an  fulfillment  center in Thornton. The solar array  comprises more than 17,000 panels  spanning 19 acres, approximately  the size of 14 football fields. The  6-MW system generates enough  energy to provide up to 45% of the  855,000-square-foot facility’s annual  energy needs. In 2020, we unveiled ’s largest  solar rooftop installation in Europe at a  fulfillment center in the UK. The facility  is outfitted with more than 11,500  solar panels, which generate enough  electricity to power the equivalent of  700 homes in the UK for one year.  operates hundreds of world-class facilities in cities  across the globe that serve our customers and support our  local communities. We are designing buildings that help  lead the industry toward net-zero carbon, while improving  the resource efficiency of our facilities and prioritizing the  health and wellness of our building occupants. Decarbonizing Our Buildings 
 is working to reduce the carbon emissions  associated with our buildings, from the carbon embodied  in construction materials, to the operational emissions  from powering our activities. In 2020, we launched an  in-depth study of our operations facilities to examine the  energy intensity of our buildings and identify ways to  reduce carbon through energy efficiency enhancements,  new technologies, and sustainable building materials. We  have started applying these insights across building types  and are incorporating best practices into future building  development plans. The World’s First Net-Zero Carbon Arena 
In 2020,  secured the naming rights to   Climate Pledge Arena, slated to become the first net-zero  carbon certified arena in the world. In November, the  arena submitted its net-zero carbon registration to the  International Living Future Institute, an industry leader in  sustainable building practices. Construction plans for the  arena preserve the building’s existing roof and expand the  underground structure to reduce the embodied energy  use typical of new construction. The arena will feature all- electric operations systems powered by 100% renewable  electricity from on-site solar panels and off-site renewable  energy projects. Events at the arena will be made fully net- zero carbon by investing in forestry projects that sequester  any remaining carbon emissions from the arena’s operations  through nature-based solutions. Additional commitments  include eliminating single-use plastics, conserving water,  and producing zero waste from the arena’s operations. Plans for our second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia,  feature a range of carbon reduction solutions and energy  efficiency enhancements, including highly efficient  building systems, high-efficiency lighting with advanced  controls, and a high-performing building envelope that  facilitates climate control. All-electric central heating and  cooling systems will eliminate on-site combustion for  heating and domestic hot water, and a nearby solar farm  will power the campus with 100% renewable energy. The buildings will incorporate locally sourced materials,  to reduce the carbon impact of material transportation,  and low-carbon materials, including low-carbon concrete Buildings across our Arlington HQ are designed to  achieve LEEDv4 Platinum certification, the highest  green building certification by the U.S. Green Building  Council. Our plans support the local community with five  acres of landscaped public open space, new protected  bike lanes, and urban design features that promote  pedestrian connections and safety. Other human-centric  design features include enhanced ventilation, increased  access to daylight, and the Helix—an alternative work  environment to support human connection with  nature. The design of our Arlington HQ promotes  wellness, collaboration, and connections to nature for  the neighborhood and the 25,000 employees who will  occupy the Arlington headquarters by 2025. ’s global corporate offices are located in vibrant  communities and urban hubs. Many of our corporate  buildings offer plazas and open green spaces for  communal and public use. Even more feature green roofs  and other green infrastructure that provide outdoor  amenity space while supporting ecological functions  like green stormwater management. The interiors  integrate biophilic design concepts, such as green walls  and locally sourced woods, along with energy-efficient  lighting, composting and recycling, and amenity spaces  for employee wellness. Many of our buildings also offer  plug-in electric vehicle charging stations, bike parking,  
Our flagship Seattle campus features some of our most  innovative sustainable design practices. A district energy  system below ground heats many of our buildings in the  Denny Triangle neighborhood using waste heat generated  from a neighboring data center. Above ground, employees  and visitors can enjoy The Spheres, an alternative workplace  and indoor plant conservatory, with 40,000 plants from  the cloud forest regions of more than 30 countries, and a  4,000-square-foot green wall. Many of our Seattle office  towers are certified LEED Gold, incorporating holistic  sustainability measures for energy and water conservation,  improved indoor environmental quality, and healthy  material selection. On the other side of the world, our offices in Munich are  certified Gold for environmental design by the German  Sustainable Building Council based on their energy- efficient interiors and use of sustainable building materials. In Luxembourg, efficient chillers and an advanced building  management system cut energy costs, while rooftop  beehives supply honey, and food is served in compostable  and biodegradable containers. ’s operations facilities include a variety of building  types and sizes where we process orders for our customers. To minimize energy use, these facilities feature state-of- the-art technology and are designed with efficient building  systems. We are expanding our use of building control  system technology and real-time data analytics to optimize  our heating and cooling systems for occupant comfort  while operating as efficiently as possible. Through building  retrofits and energy studies, we are continuously improving  and optimizing the efficiency of our operations, uncovering  savings opportunities, and driving carbon out of our  fulfillment operations. Many of our operations facilities throughout the U.S.,  Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a  rooftop installation can power up to 80% of a facility’s  energy use. As of June 2021, we have more than 90  rooftop solar installations on operations facilities around  the world and we continue to scale this program globally. Physical Stores 
 Physical Stores provide a range of retail and  grocery shopping experiences for our customers. Our  physical stores use highly efficient LED lighting, with  energy-reducing lighting controls, and incorporate natural  
daylighting techniques, such as skylights and large windows. We also utilize energy-efficient heating and cooling systems  to reduce energy consumption. Across our grocery channels,  we are replacing conventional refrigerants with natural  alternatives that have a lower ozone depletion and global  warming potential. In many of our new physical stores,  we are increasing our use of doored cases for refrigerated  products, enhancing energy efficiency and maintaining  product quality for longer durations. More than 30 of our Whole Foods Market stores already use  refrigerants with low global warming potential and more  than 100 facilities are adopting an alternative refrigerant  from Honeywell. Among them is a flagship location in  Brooklyn, New York, where state-of-the-art refrigeration  and energy systems make the store approximately 60%  more efficient than the average grocery store. Locations  near San Francisco use advanced cloud computing,  predictive analytics, and thermal energy storage to  modulate their refrigeration systems during peak energy  use. Whole Foods Market is a founding member of the  North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council and a  founding partner of the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency’s GreenChill program, which helps food retailers  transition to alternative refrigerants, reduce refrigerant  charge sizes, eliminate leaks, and adopt green refrigeration  technologies. Data Centers 
AWS is continuously working to increase the efficiency of our  facilities, and our scale allows us to achieve higher resource  utilization and efficiency than typical on-premises data  centers. When possible, we incorporate direct evaporative  technology for cooling our data centers, reducing energy  
Our operations teams in India began installing solar panels on  buildings in 2017. As of June 2021, eight fulfillment centers  and five sortation centers together produce a total of 12 MW  of solar energy to power operations across facilities in Delhi,  Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Mumbai. In Ireland, AWS is collaborating with the City of Dublin, the  South Dublin County Council, and Fortum, a Finnish energy  supply company, to bring district heating to South Dublin. By  the end of 2021, recycled heat from an AWS data center will  provide a low-carbon, low-cost source of heat for public sector,  residential, and commercial customers in the Dublin suburb of  Tallaght. This custom-built district heating scheme—the first  of its kind in Ireland—helps support the country’s renewable  energy targets. This project will  meaningfully contribute  to helping Ireland achieve  its 2030 sustainability  targets, and we look  forward to future  collaborations with AWS  towards a low-carbon  future in South Dublin. and water consumption. During cooler months, outside air is  directly supplied to the data center without using any water. During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled  through an evaporative process using water before being  pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized our  cooling systems to minimize water usage. AWS has also  demonstrated our commitment to water stewardship by  using reclaimed or recycled water instead of potable water  in multiple regions, and we are working with local utilities to  expand the use of reclaimed water. We are also working to reduce the embodied carbon of  new data centers. Embodied carbon is the carbon emitted  during the extraction, manufacturing, and transportation  of materials to the data center construction site. It is  dispersed in the atmosphere before the data center  is operational. We are starting by reducing embodied  carbon in the primary structural materials used in our  data centers, concrete and steel. By reducing the cement  content in our concrete and sourcing steel from electric  arc furnace mills, we can reduce the embodied carbon in  the structure of our data centers by at least 20%. These  requirements are already included in projects in Dublin,  Singapore, and San Francisco, and will be standard in our  AWS-operated data centers by the end of 2021. Transportation is a major component of ’s  business operations and a key part of our plan to  reach net-zero carbon by 2040. We are optimizing  and transforming our transportation network through  technological innovations, efficiency enhancements, and  alternative solutions that allow us to deliver packages to  our customers more sustainably. Electrifying Our Delivery Fleets 
In 2019,  ordered 100,000 custom electric  delivery vehicles from Rivian—the largest order ever of  electric delivery vehicles. We rolled out the first of these  vehicles in Los Angeles in February 2021 and will expand  to neighborhoods in up to 15 additional U.S. cities by  the end of the year. We plan to have 10,000 vehicles  on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles  deployed by 2030. One of the fastest-growing modern  commercial electrification programs, this initiative is  projected to save millions of metric tons of carbon per  year once fully deployed. In addition to these custom electric delivery vehicles,   already operates thousands of electric vehicles  worldwide, delivering more than 20 million packages in  electric vehicles to customers across North America and  Europe in 2020. We expanded our European electric  delivery fleet with an order for 1,800 electric vans from  Mercedes-Benz, a signatory of The Climate Pledge. In  India, we are adding 10,000 electric vehicles to our existing  fleet by 2025, including two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and  four-wheeler vehicles designed and manufactured by local  manufacturers. Hundreds of these vehicles are now on  the road, operated by  India’s network of Delivery  Service Partners in more than 20 cities across the country. As we expand our electric delivery fleet worldwide, we  are building the infrastructure to support our vehicles and  drivers. We are retrofitting existing facilities with charging  
technology and adding thousands of charging stations  across hundreds of facilities for our partners to use in  North America and Europe. More than 50  delivery  stations across North America and Europe are equipped  for electric vehicle usage, and all new delivery stations are  designed with the physical layout and electrical capacity  to meet the needs of our current and future electric  delivery fleets. These facilities will be able to support  parking and charging at night and deliveries during the day,  including same-day deliveries and deliveries to lockers and  businesses. We are also partnering with publicly accessible  charging networks to allow drivers to top off with clean  electricity when traveling outside of our charging network. We use a range of alternative delivery methods to increase  efficiency and reduce emissions on last mile routes to  our customers’ doorsteps. In dense, urban centers like  New York City, Paris, and Tokyo, we deliver packages  by bicycle and on foot, using push walkers. Our bicycle  fleet includes traditional bicycles and pedal-assist electric  bikes connected to cargo trailers that can carry up to 45  packages. We operate more than 300 e-cargo bikes to  make deliveries from Whole Foods Market locations to  customers in Manhattan and Williamsburg, New York. In 2021, we are expanding our micro-mobility fleet across 20  European locations to comprise more than 500 vehicles,  including e-cargo bikes, electric scooters, and walkers. We are also developing fully autonomous delivery  innovations that can be powered by clean electricity. Scout and Prime Air drones are electrically- powered autonomous devices that can deliver packages to  customers without the need for a delivery vehicle. These  devices are currently being designed and tested to be able  to transport small packages quickly, safely, and sustainably. Testing New Solutions in Freight   and Air Transport 
Unlike last mile delivery, long-distance transport has few  low-carbon technologies available. We are exploring,  testing, and investing in sustainable innovations in freight  and air transport to reduce emissions on our longest  routes. We also use data and algorithms to consolidate  as many shipments as possible onto a single vehicle or  plane, and we analyze which items are ordered most  frequently by location to minimize long-distance deliveries. By boosting efficiency across our network, we can put  fewer vehicles and planes into service, reducing the carbon  intensity of each package. Freight Transport  
We are investing in a variety of solutions to decarbonize  our freight transportation network. In 2020, we ordered  battery electric trucks from Lion Electric, and in 2021, we  began testing hydrogen-powered trucks. We also launched  compressed natural gas (CNG) tractors, which are fueled  by renewable natural gas sourced from landfills and dairy  farms. We plan to operate more than 2,700 of these  tractors in North America, the UK, Germany, and France by  the end of 2021. These initial investments allow us to test  the performance of different sustainable technologies and  determine which solutions could be most effectively scaled  across our network. While we work to adopt the most efficient, cutting-edge  vehicle technologies, we are also maximizing efficiency in  our existing fleets. Across North America and Europe, our  fleet includes trailers in different sizes that are equipped  with aerodynamic skirts, mud flaps, and automatic tire  
inflation systems. These features save an average of 100  gallons of diesel fuel per vehicle annually. In the UK, we use  double-deck trailers that allow us to double the capacity  of a normal trailer and reduce the number of trucks on  the road. We are also expanding multimodal transport  to reduce the emissions from road travel. In Europe, we  predominantly use rail for inventory transfers between  fulfillment centers and have expanded to short trips by sea  and waterways. Air Transport 
To reduce the carbon emissions of air transport, we are  investing in sustainable aviation fuels, which are derived from  renewable resources and generate fewer carbon emissions  than standard aviation fuel. In 2020,  Air secured  6 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, signaling our  
The partnership between   India and  Mahindra Electric is  a welcome step which  reaffirms India’s  significant progress in  the e-mobility industry,  and highlights the  role of auto makers  and e-commerce  companies to achieve  our environmental  sustainability goals. demand for low-carbon aviation fuel alternatives. Since then,  this fuel has been used to power some flights on the   Air network in the U.S., reducing our carbon emissions in flight  up to 20% over standard aviation fuel when this alternative  is utilized. Most of our aircraft also feature design innovations  like winglets, which improve fuel efficiency by reducing drag. On the ground, we use cutting-edge electric equipment to  service our planes, and we are working to equip air cargo  facilities with rooftop solar panels, to generate on-site  renewable energy. We are also investing in emerging sustainable aviation  technologies through The Climate Pledge Fund. ZeroAvia, a  Climate Pledge Fund recipient, develops hydrogen-electric  aviation solutions that will progressively enable turbo- propeller aircraft to transport passenger or cargo payloads  with zero carbon emissions. The Climate Pledge Fund is also  investing in Infinium, a company that focuses on converting  carbon dioxide and hydrogen feedstock into net-zero carbon  fuels for use in today’s air transport, marine freight, and heavy  truck fleets. With support from The Climate Pledge Fund,  these solutions will help  transition away from fossil  fuels across our transportation network. Partnering with Experts and Industry 
Transforming the transportation industry from one that  uses fossil fuels to one based on clean energy requires  
cross-sector stakeholder engagement among vehicle  manufacturers, battery and component suppliers, state and  local policymakers, fleet operators, and utilities. is  working with industry experts and organizations to advance  sustainability through collaboration and innovation in the  transportation and logistics industries. In 2020,  partnered with Ceres and other fleet  operators to launch the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance,  bringing together companies that work to accelerate the  transition to electric vehicles. This alliance helps aggregate  corporate demand for transportation electrification, while also  providing a platform to coordinate support for policies that  enable fleet electrification. In 2021, members of the alliance  published a comprehensive report on ways that utilities,  regulators, and policymakers can enable fleet operators  to electrify commercial transportation and reduce carbon  emissions. In 2017,  signed the Sustainable Fuel Buyers’  Principles developed by the nonprofit Business for Social  Responsibility and its Future of Fuels working group. These  principles provide a framework to catalyze the transition to  a sustainable road freight transportation system. was one of 18 companies to sign the Buyer’s Principles,  demonstrating our commitment to accelerate the transition  to low-carbon commercial transportation solutions. More than 7,500 ians have joined together as  Sustainability Ambassadors—a grassroots organization  of sustainability-minded employees working to expand  the efforts of our global teams that manage ’s  environmental and social impacts. Since launching in 2017,  the Sustainability Ambassadors program has transformed  into a collaborative community of more than 450 chapters  across the world, and continues to grow. Ambassadors raise awareness of sustainability as a practice  for all ians by delivering environmental education  through on-site and virtual events. They lead projects  and develop initiatives on  campuses and across  communities to help fellow ians reduce their  environmental impact at home or at work. The program  also provides a community for sharing best practices  among teams in different settings and locations. Ambassadors in our operations organization focus on  sustainability projects that help sites reduce carbon  and operational waste. One example comes from an  Ambassador team in Poland, where members redesigned  the waste segregation process in their fulfillment center,  improving waste recycling rates by more than 90%. At  a fulfillment center in France, team members installed a  food waste composter for associates to use at the end of  their break times, generating compost that our associates  are able to take home for their gardens. This solution  is now being tested for adoption across our fulfillment  centers in Canada. An Ambassador team in Italy identified  the challenge of recycling personal protective equipment  used to keep employees safe during the COVID-19  pandemic. The team found a waste services provider and  set up a process to collect the used equipment, turning  hard hats, gloves, and safety shoes into materials used  for soundproofing walls and soft flooring for children’s  play areas. Ambassadors in our corporate offices also have a unique  opportunity to launch ideas with data-driven analysis  using  technology. After auditing waste at our  global headquarters in Seattle, Ambassadors developed  a proposal to improve waste sorting using DeepLens—a  deep learning-enabled video camera from AWS. A team of   employees built a dataset and model that used  DeepLens’ object detection capabilities to identify the  waste items being discarded and deploy built-in audio to  help people identify the correct bin to use for a given item. In 2020, Sustainability Ambassadors organized the first  Inside Sustainability Summit—a virtual educational event  available to all ians to learn more about ’s  sustainability programs and partnerships. The event drew  12,500 registrations across 25 virtual sessions, from  ians in 39 countries. The summit also featured a  crowdsourcing challenge for  employees to present  innovative ideas on sustainability. The winning submission  identified strategic partnerships to reduce emissions in  our supply chain and contribute to ’s goal of  achieving net-zero carbon by 2040. With the support of  senior management mentorship, this winning project is  being rolled out across Europe in 2021, demonstrating  how Sustainability Ambassadors contribute to ’s  broader sustainability goals. I have always believed in  great challenges, in life  and at work. I was  upset that safety  shoes were [being]  thrown away. At  , we found  a way to recycle  them, so that our  shoes became  floors for children’s  playgrounds. Alone we cannot  do anything, but  together we can  change the world. AWS is focused on efficiency and continuous innovation  across our global infrastructure, as we continue on our  path to powering our operations with 100% renewable  energy by 2025. In 2021, AWS joined the data center industry in Europe to  create the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, an industry  commitment to proactively lead the transition to a climate  neutral economy. The Pact establishes a Self-Regulatory  Initiative which was developed in co-operation with the  European Commission. It supports both the European Green  Deal, which aims to make Europe the world’s first climate  neutral continent by 2050, and the European Data Strategy by  making EU data centers climate neutral by 2030. Signatories  of the Pact commit to meeting ambitious goals to facilitate  Europe’s essential transition to a greener economy by agreeing  to prove energy efficiency with measurable targets, purchase  100% renewable energy, prioritize water conservation, reuse  and repair servers, and look for ways to recycle heat. AWS is  proud to join the Pact. We know that by working together, we  can raise the bar for data centers and help support the goals of  the European Green Deal. AWS has always been focused on improving efficiency in  every aspect of our infrastructure. From the highly available  infrastructure that powers our servers, to techniques we  use to cool our data centers, and the innovative server  designs that deliver AWS services to our customers—energy  efficiency is a primary goal of our global infrastructure. Through our scale and focus on innovation, we can achieve  higher resource utilization and energy efficiency than is  possible for the typical on-premises data center, and we are  continuously working on ways to do more. The results of a study by 451 Research show that AWS’s  infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the  median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed. More than  two-thirds of this advantage is attributable to the combination  of a more energy efficient server population and much higher  server utilization. AWS data centers are also more energy- efficient than enterprise sites due to comprehensive efficiency  programs that touch every facet of the facility. For example, we have improved power efficiency and  availability by removing the central Uninterruptible Power  Supply (UPS) from our data center design and integrating  small battery packs and custom power supplies into our  racks. These changes combined reduce energy conversion  loss by about 35%. AWS also continues to increase the efficiency of the  custom hardware and software we design to deliver AWS  services. Graviton2 is AWS’s most power-efficient processor,  providing better performance per watt than any other  processor we currently use. With the world’s increasing  need for compute and other IT infrastructure, continually  innovating at the chip level is critical to ensuring we can  sustainably power the workloads of the future. AWS also works closely with our customers to accelerate  mutually shared sustainability goals. Customers such as Addressing climate change requires innovation across the  world, across industries, and across startups and multi-national  corporations. From distributed energy and storage solutions,  to efficiency and optimization software—clean technology  investment and innovation is surging. To help foster the rapid  growth of clean tech innovations, AWS launched the   AWS Clean Energy Accelerator in 2021. The program seeks  to help clean energy startups accelerate their impact, access  additional resources, and expand their reach. The AWS Clean Energy Accelerator was developed in  collaboration with Freshwater Advisors, a U.S.-based innovation  consultancy and venture catalyst. Together with Freshwater  Advisors, AWS selected 10 startups to participate in the  five-week accelerator in 2021. The program offers technical,  business, and go-to-market mentorship from AWS clean energy  experts, as well as collaboration opportunities with AWS energy  customers and members of  Partner Network (APN)  looking for clean energy solutions. Acciona, BP, Engie, and Shell are leveraging AWS to drive  digital innovation, including data migration and application  modernization to cloud-native technologies, and to  collaborate on artificial intelligence and machine learning  use cases. These customers help accelerate ’s  journey to meet our Climate Pledge goal by providing  reliable, flexible solar and wind energy to power our  operations with 100% renewable energy. 3.6x AWS has multiple initiatives underway to use water more  efficiently and use less potable (drinking) water to cool  our data centers. AWS develops our water-use strategy  by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local  water management and availability, and the opportunity  to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic  approach, we assess both the water and energy usage  of each potential cooling solution to select the most  efficient method. Evaporative Cooling 
When possible, AWS incorporates direct evaporative  technology to cool our data centers, reducing energy and  water consumption. During cooler months, outside air is  supplied directly to the data center without using any water. During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled  through an evaporative process using water before being  pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized these  cooling systems to minimize water usage. AWS is constantly  innovating the design of our cooling systems to further  reduce water use, and we adapt to changing weather  conditions based on real-time sensor data. Recycled Water 
To help conserve local drinking water sources, AWS is  expanding our use of non-potable water for cooling  purposes. In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data  center operator to be approved to use recycled water with  direct evaporative cooling technology. We partnered with  Loudoun Water to demonstrate the benefits of recycled  water for industrial cooling applications and shared our  operational best practices for using recycled water in our  
data centers. In the AWS U.S. West (Oregon) Region, we  partnered with a local utility to use non-potable water for  multiple data centers, and in Northern California, we are  retrofitting AWS data centers to use recycled water. AWS is working with local utilities to expand distribution  infrastructure and drive faster implementation and  adoption of recycled water for data center cooling  applications, in order to reduce our usage of potable water. AWS is working with the Swedish municipality of Katrineholm  and local water supply company Sörmland Vatten to support  a vital upgrade of the town’s storm water infrastructure,  creating a new wetland just outside of Katrineholm in Stora  Djulö. The new wetland and storm water infrastructure  improvement project is supported by a $4 million contribution  from AWS as part of our long-term commitment to  sustainability. The project is due for completion in 2026  and will help reduce flooding, improve water quality and  biodiversity, and provide citizens with a new recreational space  for outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and birdwatching. The water conservation project will also form part of a long- term solution for sustainable surface water management for  the Katrineholm Logistics Center industrial park, north east of  Katrineholm. AWS is implementing on-site modular water treatment  systems in multiple regions. As water is cycled through  evaporative cooling units, minerals build up as water  evaporates, eventually reaching a level of concentration  that requires replacement with fresh water. On-site water  treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals  and reuse water for more cycles. Increasing our “cycles of  concentration” allows us to continue to reduce the water  intake needed to cool our data centers. Water Efficiency Metrics 
In each infrastructure region where we use water for  cooling, AWS has developed water efficiency metrics  to determine and monitor optimal water use for each  AWS Region, and we employ a data-driven approach to  select the most effective water reduction technologies. Water metrics from each AWS Region help us evaluate  technologies and understand their long-term impacts  on our water usage, in order to increase efficiency as our  infrastructure grows and we expand to new regions. We are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility  water meters, and we are also installing our own meters to  track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for  our operations and sustainability teams. By analyzing this  data, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage  and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting  for bills or usage reports. Along with reducing our water usage, AWS looks for  opportunities to return water to the community. In our  U.S. West (Oregon) Region, for example, we partnered  with the City of Umatilla and the West Extension Irrigation  District to deliver water to farmers. Since our cooling  water is not dirty, instead of sending it to a wastewater  treatment plant, we deliver it to the local community to  be repurposed for irrigation. In our U.S. West (Oregon)  Region, we reuse 96% of cooling water generated from  our data centers. AWS is also working on community water programs all  around the world. We are partnering with Water.org and  WaterAid in India and Indonesia, where water filtration  plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and groundwater  recharge projects will bring a combined 250 million  gallons of water per year to 165,000 people. We are also  funding watershed restoration efforts with The Nature  Conservancy in Cape Town and São Paulo that will  increase water supply availability by 41 million gallons   per year. Shifting to renewable energy has environmental benefits  beyond lowering carbon emissions. According to the  International Energy Agency, the energy sector is responsible for  10% of global water withdrawals, used for operating thermal  power plants and producing fuels. Unlike thermal power plants,  wind and solar plants do not require large amounts of water  to operate. In 2020, ’s renewable energy generation  helped to avoid the withdrawal of about 480 billion liters of  water—enough to supply 1 million American households or fill  up 190,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools each year. The  Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks  to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by  minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and  analyze large sustainability datasets. ASDI works with  scientific organizations to identify, host, and deploy key  datasets on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations,  weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery,  hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. Our approach allows sustainability researchers to analyze  massive amounts of data in mere minutes, regardless of  where they are in the world or how much local storage  space or computing capacity they can access. These  datasets are publicly available to anyone. In addition, ASDI  provides cloud grants to those interested in exploring the  use of AWS’ technology and scalable infrastructure to solve  big, long-term sustainability challenges with this data. Innovating for Sustainability in the Cloud 
From university researchers to local governments, federal  agencies to private startups, organizations leverage ASDI  to better understand the long-term opportunities to  address major challenges like climate change. Below are  some examples of how AWS customers are innovating for  sustainability. Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) is helping data users across the  African continent gain fast access to petabytes of decision- ready satellite data. The project enables African nations to  track changes across the continent in unprecedented detail  
by making Earth observation data more easily accessible. This will provide valuable insights for better decision-making  around prevention and planning for flooding, droughts, soil  and coastal erosion, agriculture, forest-cover, land use and  land cover change, water availability and quality, and changes  to human settlements. AWS and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) jointly  awarded $1.5 million worth of cloud services to 21 projects  from 17 developing countries through the Earth Observation AWS and the Group on Earth Observations  (GEO) jointly awarded $1.5 million worth  of cloud services to 21 projects from 17  developing countries through the Earth  Observation Cloud Credits Programme. Cloud Credits Programme. These grants encourage the use  of Earth observations to support sustainable environmental  development, including the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk  Reduction, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. OpenAQ is empowering communities around the globe to  clean their air by harmonizing, sharing, and using open air- quality data. Hosted on AWS, the OpenAQ platform is playing  a key role in helping understand how air quality is being  impacted by COVID-19. After extreme weather events—such as hurricanes, tornadoes,  and floods—NOAA’s Emergency Response Imagery, hosted  on AWS, provides timely access to baseline and post-event  remote sensing imagery over those affected areas. This  capability is critical to guiding action and ensuring that lives  and property are protected. Such imagery provides a cost- effective way to better understand the damage sustained to  both property and the environment. Building upon modern modeling techniques validated through  peer-review science, the First Street Foundation is defining  America’s flood risk by calculating the past, present, and future  flood risk of every home and property in the contiguous  United States. The data is available free of charge to anyone.  is minimizing waste, increasing recycling, and  providing options for our customers to reuse, repair,  and recycle their products. We are working to send less  material to the landfill and more back into the circular  economy loop.  customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging  that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable  packaging options using a science-based approach that  combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science,  and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable  change across the packaging supply chain. Driving Toward Zero Additional Packaging 
At , designing packaging starts with the customer  and works backwards. Unlike traditional retail stores,  products bought online don’t need the excess packaging  and plastic materials used for displaying products on  store shelves, such as twist-ties, bindings, and clamshell  casings. In 2008,  introduced Frustration-Free  Packaging (FFP) to help manufacturers reduce packaging  waste and develop sustainable alternatives for online  fulfillment. Our FFP programs incentivize manufacturers to  package their products in easy-to-open packaging that is  100% recyclable and ready to ship to customers without  additional  boxes. To certify products under our FFP certification tiers,   identifies specific steps that manufacturers can take to  
improve their packaging and ensure products are protected  all the way to the customer’s doorstep. We partnered with the  International Safe Transit Association to craft the standards  behind our FFP programs and have developed a network  of structural packaging designers, testing services, and  materials suppliers to support manufacturers throughout the  certification process. As of June 2021, more than 2 million  products qualify under our FFP programs. also collaborates directly with top brands and selling  partners to transform their packaging for FFP certification. We teamed up with Procter & Gamble to invent the Tide  Eco-Box, a concentrated version of Tide’s traditional laundry  detergent compressed into a fully recyclable, shipping-safe  package. The Eco-Box is produced using 60% less plastic and  30% less water than a conventional plastic jug, and requires  no additional packing materials to ship. Thousands of other  brands have made similar packaging improvements by  participating in ’s FFP programs. Specific case studies  are available on our Packaging Website. Improving Our Packaging Materials 
As we continue to expand our FFP programs to reduce the  need for additional packaging, we are improving the design  and materials used for our packaging assortment. We are  reducing the weight of packaging materials, while making our  packaging more robust to avoid damage in the e-commerce  supply chain. We’ve also added on-package messaging to  inform customers about these improvements and provide  guidance on how to recycle their packaging materials. One example is our innovative paper padded mailer, which  offers the same recyclability as our corrugated boxes, while  taking up less space in transit and in the recycling bin. The  paper padded mailer is made of four layers of paper and a  water-based cushioning material, which was designed to  easily separate in the same way that print inks and other  paper coatings are removed during the paper recycling  
As of June 2021, we have reduced the  weight of outbound packaging by over 36%  and eliminated more than 1 million tons of  packaging material since 2015—the equivalent  of 2 billion shipping boxes. process. We are expanding our use of paper padded  mailers across North America to replace the use of mixed  paper and plastic mailers by the end of 2022. We are also increasing our use of flexible paper-based  mailers across Europe, allowing us to significantly reduce  the use of plastic in packaging materials by the end of  2021. In India,  eliminated single-use, thin film  plastics in packaging in 2020 by replacing plastic materials  like bubble wrap and air pillows with paper cushions and  introducing plastic-free, biodegradable tape. To reduce  the need for packaging at all, we have developed a model  for packaging-free shipping across more than 100 Indian  cities, delivering orders in their original packaging using  protective containers that delivery drivers can reuse. Meanwhile, we are improving the composition of our plastic  packaging solutions to use less material and incorporate  more recycled content. We are increasing the recycled  content of our plastic film bags from 25% to 50% in 2021,  and from 15% to over 40% for our plastic padded bags. Together, these improvements are expected to eliminate  more than 25,000 metric tons of new plastic each year. At our Whole Foods Market stores, we switched to smaller  plastic produce bags and replaced all plastic rotisserie chicken  containers with bags that use approximately 70% less plastic. Combined, these changes are estimated to save nearly 2  million pounds of plastic annually. We also eliminated all  polystyrene meat trays across Whole Foods Market stores in  the U.S. and Canada. In 2019, Whole Foods Market became  the first national retailer to remove all plastic straws from its  cafes and coffee bars—avoiding 21 million straws annually. At  Fresh and Whole Foods Market in the U.S., we  are rolling out a curbside recyclable solution to keep grocery  
items frozen or chilled during delivery. This new packaging  is produced with recycled paper and eliminates the need for  plastic liners or bubble bag insulation. Optimizing Through Machine Learning 
How big of a box is needed for a given product? Is an   box needed at all? To optimize packaging  selections at ’s scale, we use machine learning  algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices  for deliveries. That means identifying which products don’t  need additional packaging, and which smaller products are  suitable for flexible packaging, such as padded mailers and  bags, which are up to 75% lighter than similar-sized boxes. Flexible packaging conforms around products, reducing the  need for additional packing materials, and takes up 40%  less space than a box during shipping. In cases where the  protection of a box is needed, machine learning helps us  continuously optimize box choices to fit our ever-changing  catalog of products and redesign boxes to use less material. When packaging weighs less and is the right size to protect  customer orders, we can pack more orders into each  delivery, resulting in fewer trips and less fuel burned. We also use machine learning to identify products where  even small packaging improvements can have significant  impacts on reducing waste. For example, we developed a  machine learning model to identify liquid products with the  highest average rates of customer-reported damages. We  subject those products to extensive testing at our   Packaging Lab, where we simulate a package’s journey  from the manufacturer to the customer, providing data and  insights we can share with manufacturers to improve their  packaging design. In 2020, we committed to make  device packaging  100% curbside recyclable by 2023. We are also working  to source 100% of the wood fiber in our packaging from  responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We made  significant progress toward these goals in 2020, eliminating  more than 27 million plastic bags from our device packaging  and sourcing more than 97% of the wood fiber packaging  for all new Echo and Fire TV devices launched in 2020 from  responsibly managed forests or recycled sources.  is committed to reducing our environmental  footprint through recycling initiatives in our own  operations and partnerships that support the development  of recycling infrastructure across the industry. Recycling in Our Operations 
 is reducing the operational waste associated with  customer fulfillment in facilities across the globe. Corrugated  board is the most common material that flows through  our operations, and we work with third-party recycling  haulers to remove corrugated board from our facilities  for off-site recycling. Many of these recycling haulers also  supply  with the packaging materials that we use for  customer shipments, converting waste material recovered  from  operations into new, recycled packaging. Not all of the materials we use can be easily recycled using  current available systems. Plastic film, for example, is a  difficult material to process, and most municipal recycling  programs do not accept it. In order to innovate and solve  for this gap,  has developed a process for on-site  plastic film recycling for our operations. In 2020, we began  converting plastic film into poly bags made of 100%  recycled material, which are used for package-free returns  at  drop-off locations in the U.S. After use, the  bags are collected and returned to  facilities where  we again convert them into new poly bags, repeating the  recycling process. As of June 2021, on-site plastic film  recycling is available at more than 168  sites across  North America and Europe. We are also exploring alternative solutions for less common  materials that cannot be recycled. In several European  locations, we work with our shipping label suppliers to  recycle the silicone backing paper from used shipping  labels into new label components. In the UK, we partner  with a local manufacturer to collect hundreds of rolls of  label backing paper each year, converting the material into  filling for animal bedding products. We are looking across  our entire operations network to create new uses for waste  materials in products, packaging, and operational processes. Partnering to Improve Recycling  Infrastructure  
To improve curbside recycling in the U.S., we partner with  The Recycling Partnership, which supports communities  and local governments with education, infrastructure, and  measurement related to curbside recycling. Along with  other members of The Recycling Partnership,   is funding an initiative to improve recycling activities  in the western United States called The West Coast  Contamination Initiative, which aims to increase the  quality and value of recyclables collected in these areas by  reducing the amount of non-recyclable material collected  through local recycling systems. We also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop  Infrastructure Fund to finance recycling and circular  economy infrastructure in North America. Through  this investment,  aims to increase product and  packaging recycling, ensuring that material gets back into  the manufacturing supply chain. Over the next decade,  our investment in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund  will improve curbside recycling for 3 million homes in  communities across the U.S., diverting 1 million tons of  recyclable material from landfills and eliminating the  equivalent of 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. recyclable material from landfill and eliminating the  equivalent of 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. When we have surplus inventory in our fulfillment network,   donates the eligible items to charity organizations,  giving products a new life, reducing waste, and helping to  build stronger communities 
Surplus inventory includes usable items that are overstocked,  returned, cosmetically damaged, or near expiration. Through software built by our teams, our logistics network  automatically identifies inventory that can be donated,  instead of sending these items to be recycled or to landfills. We identify partner organizations in our communities,  including nonprofits and charities, and enable them to collect  surplus inventory from  facilities and distribute these  products to people in need. contributed more than 25 million products to  our global charity partners in 2020. Together with Whole  Foods Market, we donated an additional 70 million  meals and 30 million ounces of hand sanitizer to Feeding  America, a U.S. network of food banks, pantries, soup  kitchens, shelters, and other community-based agencies. Together with Whole Foods Market,   donated 70 million meals and 30 million  ounces of hand sanitizer to Feeding America 
 product  donations are crucial  in our ability to serve  and support vulnerable  communities in the  U.S. These donations  have been even more  important in the face  of the economic crisis  brought on by COVID-19. In 2020, Whole Foods Market launched a food redistribution  program called Nourishing Our Neighborhoods that provided 21  refrigerated vans to community-based food rescue organizations. Each of these vans provides recipient organizations with  20,000 pounds of rescued food from Whole Foods Market and  surrounding grocers and retailers every week. This effort will  provide more than 180 million meals over the next 10 years to  families in need across the U.S. and Canada. We distribute the majority of our surplus inventory in the  U.S. through Good360, which partners with a network of  local nonprofits to reach people in need. is one of  the biggest suppliers of donations to Good360, helping to  provide items to low-income households, foster families,  individuals with special needs or disabilities, seniors,  veterans, immigrants, and more. In Europe, we partner with more than 100 charities and local  organizations to distribute product donations. is a  long-term partner of In-Kind Direct International, a charity  working across the UK, France, and Germany to broker  product giving among the members of its network. Through  this partnership, we donated more than 200,000 products,  including toys, shoes, clothing, and household items, to  1,800 charities in 2020. Many of our product donations are collected through  Fulfillment by  (FBA) Donations, a service we  launched in 2019 to automate the process for selling  
partners using FBA to donate their overstocked or returned  items. The service requires no additional action from selling  partners, allowing  to easily scale product donations  through our existing logistics. FBA Donations is currently  available in the U.S., the UK, France, and Japan, and we are  working to expand the program to more locations in 2021. At , we are committed to reducing food loss and waste  within our U.S. operations by 50% by 2030. We joined the  Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions group, an effort jointly  administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and  the Department of Agriculture. As part of our commitment,  we will be developing food waste reporting, generating source  reduction metrics, sharing food waste reduction programs and  progress on our website, building new food disposition paths, and  expanding existing donation programs.  Second Chance is a central hub that helps  customers eliminate waste and give products and  packaging a second life. It is available across the globe with  offerings in the U.S., Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy,  and Spain, and we recently expanded into Sweden and  Japan as well.

Pre-Owned  Devices provides  customers with access to fully functional pre-owned products  that have been screened and tested by . All of these  programs reduce waste and encourage reuse by ensuring that  valuable products can go back into the hands of customers  rather than being sent to landfills. Disposing of  Packaging 
 Second Chance helps customers responsibly  dispose of the packaging used to deliver  orders,  including  device packaging and  Grocery  deliveries. Customers can view recycling instructions by  package type on the  Second Chance site, or look  for instructions in their ship confirmation emails on how to  properly dispose of packaging included in each shipment. As part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer- centric company, we are working to give our customers  access to more sustainable products, from thousands  of -branded products we develop and  manufacture, to millions of retail and third-party   items sold in ’s store. ’s sustainable shopping initiatives give our  customers the chance to buy more sustainable products. We are committed to helping customers find products  that exceed the social and environmental benefits of  comparable options when they shop in our stores. Helping Customers Discover   More Sustainable Products 
In 2020,  launched Climate Pledge Friendly, a new  program that uses sustainability certifications to highlight  products that support our commitment to help preserve  the natural world. Customers in the U.S., the UK, France,  Germany, Italy, and Spain will see the Climate Pledge  Friendly label when shopping in ’s online store,  signifying that one or more sustainability certifications  support these products. Climate Pledge Friendly products  are clearly labeled in shopping results and have additional  sustainability information on their product pages. As of June  2021, customers can shop for more than 75,000 Climate  Pledge Friendly products in categories ranging from health  and household items, to office products and electronics. partners with a wide range of external certifications,  including governmental agencies, nonprofits, and  independent laboratories to help us distinguish more  sustainable products. We focus on certifications that are  reputable, transparent, and help preserve the natural world. also developed Compact by Design, our own  certification to identify products that have a more efficient  design. With the removal of excess air and water, products  require less packaging and become more efficient to ship. At scale, these small differences in product size and weight  lead to significant carbon emission reductions. To qualify  for Compact by Design, products must have best-in-class  “unit efficiency,” a metric that allows us to calculate the  volume and weight utilization for the number of units a  product delivers. Inviting Brands to Participate 
To expand our sustainable shopping selection, we are  inviting brands to participate in Climate Pledge Friendly  by securing certifications for products sold in ’s  store that improve at least one aspect of sustainability. For example, Seventh Generation’s Easy Dose laundry  detergent offers a Compact by Design certified super- concentrated detergent that uses 60% less plastic and  50% less water than the standard 100-ounce laundry  bottle, enabling significant energy and material savings. If every household in the U.S. were to buy one bottle of  Seventh Generation’s Easy Dose detergent instead of its  conventional 100-ounce bottle, this would save 220,000  tons of carbon dioxide equivalent every year, equivalent   to not driving 540 million miles. 75K  Climate Pledge Friendly   products as of June 2021 As part of our commitment to develop more sustainable  products, we are certifying many of our -branded  products to qualify for Climate Pledge Friendly. In the  category of household goods, Presto! by  offers  a refillable cleaning starter kit certified as Compact by  Design. One canister of dissolvable refills is 98% smaller  and 99% lighter than traditional cleaners—saving plastic,  space, and money while delivering a powerful clean. Echo,  Fire TV, and Fire Tablet devices are the first  devices  to qualify for Climate Pledge Friendly, which are certified  by the Carbon Trust and carry its Reducing CO2 label—a  certification that demonstrates a reduction in the carbon  footprint of products year over year.

We love that  is  making it simple for cus- tomers to find sustain- able products. ’s  new program will expand  our reach and enable us  to empower more brands  to design safer and more  sustainable products for  the circular economy. – William McDonough, Co-Founder of the     Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute  works with the suppliers of our branded products  to drive sustainability improvements across the stages of  material sourcing, design, manufacturing, and customer  use. Our global teams also work closely with our suppliers  to communicate our human rights standards and help  suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful  working environments. Setting a High Bar for   -Branded Products 
Customers want to be sure that the products they buy  align with their values and needs. We are committed to  embedding sustainability into -branded products  as a fundamental standard across our supply chain. While  there is no industry-wide definition of a sustainable  product, one of the ways  sets a high bar for our  branded products is through certifications. We partner  with reputable external certifiers and use our own internal  Compact by Design certification to certify products that  qualify as Climate Pledge Friendly. We also engage with  leading organizations and industry collaboratives to drive  sustainability improvements, and incorporate new insights  into our approach as we continue to learn. Our Product Categories 
When it comes to household goods like cleaning supplies  and personal care products,  customers want  options that are safe for their families and for the planet,  without compromising on quality or price. As part of our  Chemicals Policy, our Restricted Substance List provides  an extensive list of chemicals we seek to avoid in - 
owned Private Brands baby, household cleaning, personal  care, and beauty products, and applies to all suppliers of  these product categories in the U.S. and Europe. offers a range of sustainable food and grocery  options and uses many sustainably sourced, third-party  certified ingredients across our -branded selection. This includes our commitments to sustainable palm  oil and animal welfare in  Private Brands food  products. We also avoid chemicals of concern and prohibit  non-recyclable materials in  Kitchen food contact  packaging, as outlined in our Food Contact Materials  Restricted Substance List. Every food product sold at our Whole Foods Market stores must  meet rigorous Quality Standards. These standards prohibit more than  100 preservatives, flavors, colors, sweeteners, and other ingredients  commonly found in food. All meat in our meat department is traceable  back to the farm or ranch, and is sourced from animals raised without  antibiotics or added growth hormones. The fresh beef, pork, chicken,  turkey, and lamb in our meat department is certified to meet more  than 100 animal welfare standards by the Global Animal Partnership,  a nonprofit alliance of producers, retailers, animal advocates, and  scientists. All wild-caught seafood in our seafood department is  sourced from fisheries that are certified sustainable by the Marine  Stewardship Council Standard, or rated either “Green” or “Yellow” by  the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. Fresh or frozen, all of our  farm-raised seafood is responsibly farmed and traceable to the source,  and requires third-party verification of water quality and dozens of  other quality standards. We are making it easier for customers to manage their home  energy use with the Alexa energy dashboard, available in  the U.S. The dashboard works with compatible smart lights,  plugs, switches, water heaters, thermostats, televisions, and  Echo devices, allowing customers to easily track the energy  these devices use. Customers can also enable Alexa to help  them conserve energy through a new Hunches feature. For  example, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer is away and  forgot to turn off a light, Alexa can automatically turn it off,  helping customers save energy and reduce carbon emissions. We are committed to making it easier for our  customers to choose high-quality, sustainable  apparel products. We are working to  lower the environmental impact of our  -owned Private Brands apparel  products, and we partner directly with our  suppliers to find solutions that promote the  use of sustainably produced fabrics and recycled  materials, including cotton, leather, and manmade  cellulosic fibers. We collaborate with leading  apparel organizations to incorporate industry   best practices and support collective action. We are making  devices more sustainable, from  how we build them to how our customers use them. We  incorporate recycled materials into many new   devices, giving new life to materials that could otherwise  end up in waste streams. We have also developed features  like Low Power Mode to reduce the energy devices  consume during periods of inactivity over their lifetime. In  2020, we added Low Power Mode to the latest models of  Echo and Fire TV devices and are rolling out free over-the- air updates to bring Low Power Mode to older models of  devices already in customers’ homes. As of 2021, we use sustainably certified palm oil in all   Private Brands food products in North America  and Europe. In a small number of cases, palm oil credits  may be used to cover very small volumes and complex  derivatives. We revisit these cases annually with applicable  suppliers and agree on plans to transition to physically  certified sustainable palm oil where possible. We are working to ensure that all -owned  Private Brands apparel products are made using cotton  from more sustainable sources by the end of 2022. This  includes using cotton sourced from recycled materials,  from farms certified as producing organic cotton, or  through the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a global  nonprofit that aims to transform the cotton supply  chain by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable  mainstream commodity. After joining BCI in 2019, we sourced 48% of the cotton  used for our -owned Private Brands apparel  products as Better Cotton in 2020. While Better Cotton  is not physically traceable to end products, BCI farmers  benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent  volumes to those we source. is also a member of  BCI’s Retailer and Brand Advisory Panel on Traceability. In 2019,  signed the Responsible Sourcing Network’s  public Cotton Pledges, committing to not source cotton from  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan for -owned Private  Brands products until the pervasive use of government- mandated forced labor is stopped. In 2021, we began  participating in a Responsible Sourcing Network initiative  called YESS: Yarn Ethically & Sustainably Sourced, which  works to address forced labor in the cotton value chain. Cellulosic Fibers  
By 2022, we will ensure that none of the manmade  cellulosic fibers (including rayon, viscose, lyocell, and  modal) sourced for -owned Private Brands apparel  products are derived from ancient or endangered forests, endangered species’ habitats, or other controversial  sources, as defined by the nonprofit organization Canopy’s  tools and reports. Our approach to cellulosics includes  using fabrics that provide assurance on traceability and use  best-available processing technology, as well as supporting  the use of innovative lower-impact alternative fiber  sources, such as recycled fiber from used clothing. Recycled Fabrics 
We will increase the use of recycled fabrics in - owned Private Brands apparel products, including moving  from conventional to recycled polyester, and launching  products made from innovative recycled fibers. In 2020,  we joined the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit that  works with its members to drive industry transformation in  preferred fibers, including recycled materials. Leather 
In 2020, we joined the Leather Working Group, a  nonprofit membership organization that works to improve  environmental stewardship within the global leather  industry. By the end of 2023, we will source all leather  used in -owned Private Brands apparel and shoe  products from tanneries that meet the Leather Working  Group’s bronze level award or higher. Product Labels  
As of 2020, all new woven labels in -owned Private  Brands apparel products are made from recycled fabric and  all new swing tags are made from paper certified by the  Forest Stewardship Council. Recycled Materials 
In 2020, we launched Echo and Fire TV devices that include  100% post-consumer recycled fabric, 100% recycled  die-cast aluminum, and 30-50% post-consumer recycled  plastic, depending on the product. We also incorporated  50% post-consumer recycled plastic into certain power  adapters that ship with our devices. is committed to ensuring the people and  communities that support our entire value chain are  treated with fundamental dignity and respect, and we  strive to ensure the products and services we provide are  produced in a way that respects internationally recognized  human rights. As retailers of animal-derived products, we recognize  our responsibility to uphold animal welfare within our  supply chain. We expect our suppliers to uphold the Five  Freedoms framework for animal welfare, which mandates  freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort;  freedom from pain, injury, or disease; freedom to express  normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress. We  expect our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and  to take a zero-tolerance approach to animal cruelty, abuse,  and neglect. We encourage suppliers to continuously  improve their animal welfare standards and practices, and  to work toward recognized animal welfare certifications or  industry guidelines that include welfare provisions. Chemicals and Restricted Substances 
Part of our commitment to quality is avoiding chemicals of  concern in our products that can affect human health and/ or the environment. We define chemicals of concern as  those chemicals that: (1) meet the criteria for classification  as a carcinogen, mutagen, or reproductive or other  systemic toxicant; or (2) are persistent, bioaccumulative,  and toxic. We use leading science and customer feedback  to prioritize which chemicals of concern to focus on based  on product type, customer concerns, and the availability  of safer alternatives. Learn more about the chemicals we  seek to avoid in our Restricted Substance List and our Food  Contact Materials Restricted Substance List.  is committed to ensuring the people and  communities that support our entire value chain are  treated with fundamental dignity and respect, and we  strive to ensure the products and services we provide  are produced in a way that respects internationally  recognized human rights. Our commitment and approach are informed by leading  international standards and frameworks developed by  the United Nations (UN) and the International Labour  Organization (ILO). is committed to respecting  and supporting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, the Core Conventions of the ILO, and the ILO  Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our strategy to deliver on these commitments to human  rights has four pillars: developing strong policies, embedding  human rights into our business, addressing risk through  mechanisms, and transparency and stakeholder engagement. Strong Policies 
Our efforts are anchored in policies that apply across all  aspects of our business—from our own operations, to our  supply chain, to the communities in which we operate. In  a commitment to continuously raising the bar, in 2019, we  codified our long-standing commitment to human rights in  the form of ’s Global Human Rights Principles, which  reflect the foundation of how we embed respect for human  rights throughout our business. We are committed to consistently evolving and improving  our approach. We regularly review our policies to identify  areas for update and improvement. We conduct in- depth benchmarking against international standards and  evolving industry norms at least every three years in line  with industry best practices. Human Rights Principles 
From the employees in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers  delivering packages to our customers, to the workers in  factories making the products we sell—people enable our  mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. These values have been long-held at  and codifying  them into a set of Human Rights Principles demonstrates  our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity  of workers everywhere we operate around the world. Supply Chain Standards 
We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our  Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and  expectations for our suppliers, their supply chains, and  selling partners who list products in our stores, and  they are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous  improvement, and supply chain accountability. We  engage with suppliers that are committed to these same  principles; suppliers are subject to these standards as a  condition of doing business with us.  does not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor,  or human trafficking in any form in our operations or value  chain. We have detailed the components of this commitment  to combating human trafficking (also referred to as modern  slavery) in our annual Modern Slavery Statement, our Supply  Chain Standards, and our Global Human Rights Principles. We’re raising awareness through employee training and  partnerships. Our human trafficking awareness program  provides ongoing training to employees around the world to  recognize indicators of human trafficking and report concerns  to appropriate authorities in a way that puts the interests of  victims first. To develop the training, we incorporated videos and  materials from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority  (GLAA), a UK public agency focused on investigating labor  exploitation. Our global security operations team has immediate  response protocols in the event of a suspected human  trafficking-related issue, regardless of where the issue arises. We are also an official corporate sponsor of Truckers Against  Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to combating  human trafficking in the trucking industry, and began using  TAT training modules to train our internal fleet of drivers,  teaching them how to identify and respond to potential  victims of human trafficking. As of January 2021, we trained  100% of  employees who are behind the wheels of  trucks in our middle-mile business. We are committed to embedding human rights considerations  into decision-making across the company and into our policy  and governance framework. This governance starts with  ’s Board of Directors, which appoints committees  for oversight on specific issues. Among other duties, the  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees  ’s global environmental sustainability, corporate  social responsibility, and corporate governance policies,  practices, and initiatives. The Leadership Development and  Compensation Committee oversees ’s global human  capital management strategies and policies. As a global company, we recognize the responsibility  and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our  employees on human rights issues. In 2020, we enhanced our  training on human trafficking and forced labor for employees  in our logistics network. We are committed to identifying, preventing, and mitigating  adverse human rights impacts, and are continuously working  to improve our approach. At , every business  deploys a variety of mechanisms to help us inspect our  business and make decisions at various points of product  and process development and in the execution of our day- to-day operations. Social Responsibility teams review the  performance and impact of our own programs and inspect  activity in our global supply chains. In our supply chain, we assess and respond to risk by  leveraging internal and external data and guidance from  external stakeholders, including industry experts, civil society  groups, and non-governmental organizations. One way we  do this is through independent audits to verify compliance  with our Supply Chain Standards though regular on-site  inspections and confidential worker interviews. We recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive  long-term change across industries. We, like many  companies in similar industries, are exploring new ways to  encourage improvement in worker protections, including  supplier capacity building programs, worker trainings,  and collaborations with other brands and civil society. We  currently invest in capacity building programs across five  key commitment areas: Safe Workplaces, Freely Chosen  Employment, Gender Equity, Fair Wages, and Environmental  Protection. Within our own operations, we have teams dedicated to  assessing and addressing risk to our employees. Those  teams focus on establishing open communication with  our employees around the world and providing them  with meaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for  dialogue with leadership. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive  workplace, where every employee feels comfortable  sharing their unique perspectives and is supported in  growing their career. And, we are obsessed with keeping our employees safe  while on the job. We work relentlessly to innovate and  create new industry benchmarks for health and safety. Learn more about our investments   in workplace safety on page 69. We know we have more to do, and we are committed  to widening our lens to better understand the potential  human rights impacts of our business. The guidance provided by the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights recommends that companies  identify their most salient human rights risks as the first step  in a comprehensive human rights due diligence strategy. Since 2020, we have worked with sustainability and human  rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to identify salient  human rights risks across our business. In conducting this  assessment, we consulted a diverse group of external human  rights experts and incorporated their feedback into the  results. We benchmarked the results against internationally  recognized human rights standards. This assessment  identified a set of priority human rights values and key salient  human rights risks for . Our existing policies and programs currently address many  of these risks, however, we will use the assessment results  to build on current practice and prioritize our human rights  due diligence efforts. One important due diligence tool is  a human rights impact assessment (HRIA). HRIAs are an  effective mechanism to identify and address adverse impacts  business activities might have on individuals such as workers,  local community members, or consumers. The process  involves meaningful engagement with external stakeholders  to gain a full understanding of potential impacts. Meaningful Consultation with Stakeholders  Opportunity for Concerns to be Heard and Issues Resolved  Focus on Vulnerable Groups In 2020, we conducted our first HRIA to assess the raw  and recovered materials supply chain for -branded  digital devices (Kindle, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Ring, and Echo),  including the manufacture, assembly, and return of those  products. The raw and recovered materials supply chain  is a complex system of sellers, buyers, traders, producers,  processors, and manufacturers across multiple tiers and  sourcing regions around the world. This supply chain is, in  many places, highly opaque, adding to the challenge of  identifying and prioritizing salient human rights risks and  impacts. For this assessment, we focused on four supply  chain categories: Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing, reverse  logistics, minerals and metals, and plastics and synthetics. We engaged an independent third-party expert, Article One,  to research key human rights risks across these categories,  conduct a gap analysis of ’s current approach to  managing human rights risks, and identify opportunities  to have a positive impact. The process included internal  interviews, reviews of media and third-party reporting, and  external stakeholder engagement. We selected external  stakeholders based on their representation of impacted  groups, geographic scope, and expertise in human rights. They included experts on a wide array of issues, including  human rights and sustainable development in technology,  
Using the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human  Rights as a framework to guide the assessment, the HRIA  conducted this past year resulted in the following findings  and areas of opportunity for the supply chains of - branded digital devices, which was the focus of this HRIA. These findings and areas of opportunity could also be  applied across : 
Tier 1 and 2 Manufacturing: These are the facilities  and suppliers involved in the final assembly of   devices (Tier 1) and component manufacturing (Tier 2). The assessment found that  suppliers in this  category had moderate to high levels of awareness of  ’s social compliance requirements. However,  challenges remain throughout the electronics industry  as a whole, including: difficulties enforcing working hour  and rest requirements; low or unequal wages, even when  compliant with national minimum wages standards; and  absence of effective grievance mechanisms for workers. Raw and Recovered Materials Supply Chain  This map is a simplified visual of supply chain categories   assessed for this report. Reverse Logistics: Reverse logistics encompasses  what a company does with returned products and how  a returned product re-enters the supply chain. The  assessment found risks in this sector were similar to those  identified for Tier 1 and 2 Manufacturing. Minerals and Metals:  conducts robust due  diligence on our suppliers annually to ensure the absence  of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) in  our supply chain. Human rights issues are also associated  with other minerals, metals, and rare earth supply chains. Read more about our approach to conflict minerals on  page 89. Plastics and Synthetics: The electronics industry as a  whole has limited visibility over the sourcing locations of  the plastics and synthetics supply chain or the chemicals  used in plastic production. These commodities are sold to  countless purchasers across multiple tiers of production,  making traceability extremely difficult. This HRIA was a key milestone in our human rights strategy  and deepened our understanding of salient human rights  risks in the  devices supply chain and the electronics  industry as a whole. We will incorporate the results of this  assessment into our overall business approach, continuing  to improve our reporting and transparency and build on our  progress. The assessment results pointed to several areas  of opportunity. These include increased access to effective  grievance mechanisms and remedy through strategic  partnerships. We will further our efforts to incorporate  social responsibility performance evaluation tools into our  assessment of reverse logistics suppliers and work with  our suppliers to increase their use of recycled or renewable  materials in place of virgin materials. We are also scoping  expansion of our human rights due diligence beyond conflict  minerals to other minerals with human rights risk. Another  critical opportunity includes deepening our engagement  with external stakeholders to improve management of  our salient human rights risks and identify opportunities  for long-term partnerships to address systemic issues. As  we implement the HRIA results based on priority, we will  continue to identify opportunities to promote human rights  across the  devices supply chain. We are committed to driving industry-wide best practices  in human rights due diligence through increased  disclosures about our approach and by expanding our  stakeholder engagement. Each year, we publicly share  the most up-to-date information about our programs,  including external partnerships with organizations that  share our core human rights values. Transparency 
We publish an interactive supply chain map that provides  details on suppliers of -branded apparel, consumer  electronics, food and beverage, and home goods products. We expanded the map in 2020 to include suppliers’ factory  locations, additional suppliers and product categories, more  information on capacity building programs completed by  individual suppliers, and gender data, where available. In 2020, we disclosed additional information about  our supplier assessment process and audit results, our  approach to worker engagement, and the goals we have  set for ourselves on such topics as forced labor training and  gender equity. In this report, we provide an update on our  goals, the results of our mapping to understand our salient  human rights risks, the results of our devices human rights  impact assessment, and year-over-year supplier audit  results. We report annually in line with the UN Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting  Framework and we annually update our Modern Slavery  Statement. Engagement with external stakeholders is key to our  human rights due diligence approach. We rely on experts  and affected rights-holders to inform our approach and  ensure that our efforts have the intended impact. Through  these partnerships, we access invaluable expert input to  our work, helping us achieve greater impact on working  conditions around the world. In the last year, we have built a number of new relationships, including:    Joining the Better Cotton Initiative’s Retailer and Brand  Advisory Panel on Traceability. Becoming a pilot sponsor of the Responsible Sourcing  Network initiative, YESS: Yarn Ethically & Sustainably  Sourced. YESS works to address forced labor in the  cotton value chain by providing training to—and  managing the assessment of—spinners and fabric mills  to identify, prevent, mitigate, and avoid sourcing cotton  produced with forced labor. Joining the Centre for Child Rights and Business  working group to engage with peer brands and identify  common challenges, share resources, and implement  best practices to make supply chains safer for children,  young persons, and working migrant parents. Adding our apparel suppliers to the Open Apparel  Registry to foster brand collaboration and action in the  apparel industry. Joining the Brand Ethical Working Group, an informal  group of more than 40 brand members operating  in India that work to find solutions to industry-level  challenges. Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s  most customer-centric company. Our ranks are full of  passionate people who are building new products and  services every day on behalf of our customers.  is building a strong culture and investing in our  people to attract the diverse, innovative workforce we  need to exceed our customers’ expectations today and into  the future. We are committed to providing the support,  benefits, and opportunities our employees need to be  successful, whether they are building their careers at   or developing skills with us to help them on their  professional journey. Comprehensive Benefits and   Competitive Pay 
In the U.S., ’s starting wage is $15 per hour for  all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired  by agencies), and seasonal employees. We also offer  competitive starting wages around the world. Our starting  hourly wage is 9.70 GBP in the UK, 16 CAD in Canada, 12  EUR in Germany, and 10.67 EUR in France. Offering leading  starting wages has a positive impact on other wages in  local labor markets where  operates in the U.S. A  recent study by economists at the University of California- Berkeley and Brandeis University found that ’s  decision to increase its starting wage to $15 per hour  resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage  among other employers in the same labor market based  on commuting zone. In addition to competitive pay, regular full-time employees  in the U.S. have opportunities to participate in a 401(k) plan  with 50% company matching up to 4% of compensation;  open Flexible Spending Accounts for health and dependent  care; and receive paid time off and holiday overtime pay. Healthcare and Family Support 
In the U.S., we offer comprehensive, transgender-inclusive  health benefits that start the first day on the job for  regular, full-time employees. More than 90% of our  regular full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. are  eligible for healthcare benefits. These benefits include  medical, prescription drug, dental, and vision coverage. To  increase access to quality and affordable healthcare for our  employees, we are building a network of Neighborhood  Health Centers on-site or close to our facilities in five U.S.  states, offering clinics exclusively dedicated to serving our  employees and their families. We offer U.S. employees  and their families access to telehealth and on-demand  healthcare services through  Care, which allows  them to connect with a doctor in 60 seconds or less. We  also launched a new mental health benefit in 2021 called  Resources for Living, offering free confidential mental  health services to U.S. employees, their families, and  members of their household. offers generous, flexible paid leave for parents,  from our hourly employees to our most senior executives. We offer up to 20 weeks of paid leave to birth mothers  and six weeks to non-birth parents or parents who adopt. In the U.S., we offer adoption reimbursement, access to  comprehensive infertility coverage, and parental leave  benefits like Leave Share and Ramp Back. Leave Share  allows employees to share any amount of their parental leave with their partner. Ramp Back enables employees  to return to work after birth or adoption on a flexible,  reduced schedule for up to eight weeks. Where possible,  we provide unlimited gender transition benefits, including  gender affirmation, and we have internal resources to help  managers and team members support employees who are  going through gender transition. Outside of the U.S., we offer our employees access to  benefits to support physical and financial well-being,  including access to healthcare coverage and long-term  savings plans. We are working to evolve our benefits  programs in different countries to support the needs of our  diverse workforce. For example, in India, we cover infertility  treatment and gender reassignment surgery through a  select network of high-quality service providers. employees in 26 countries have access to telehealth  services, providing fast and safe access to care, and in  21 countries, ReThink helps families with children who  have autism and other disabilities build the skills they  need to reach their fuller potential. Additionally,   employees around the world and their eligible dependents  have access to an Employee Assistance Program that  provides mental health support 24 hours a day. Education and Career Advancement  
In 2019,  committed $700 million to pilot, launch,  and scale free or low-cost upskilling opportunities to 100,000  employees by 2025. Since making this commitment,   has scaled and expanded our skills training programs, with  15,000 employees participating in the first 12 months. Through this pledge,  is helping our workforce gain  education to transition into high demand and technical roles  in areas that will continue growing in years to come, such as  medicine, cloud computing, and machine learning. Among our skills training programs is Career Choice, which  pre-pays 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields  for employees in the U.S., Europe, Australia, South Africa,  Canada, and Costa Rica. Through Career Choice, more than  40,000 employees in 14 countries have pursued degrees  across the fields of information technology, healthcare,  mechanical and skilled trades, administration and business  services, and transportation. Additional programs include   Apprenticeship,  Technical Academy,  Associate2Tech, Machine Learning University, and AWS  Training and Certification, all of which help   employees gain critical skills to move into higher skill, better- paying, technical and non-technical roles, either within   or elsewhere. Protecting Our Employees   During COVID-19 
Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of our  employees, which is why  made over 150 process  improvements and invested more than $11.5 billion on  COVID-related initiatives to keep employees safe and get  products to customers throughout 2020. This includes investments related to COVID-19 safety measures such as  personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of our  facilities, processes that allow for effective social distancing,  higher wages for hourly teams, and developing our own  COVID-19 testing capabilities. We added more than 5,700 janitorial staffers to our teams and  2,200 handwashing stations to our global facilities in 2020. We provided supplies to our fulfillment centers and office sites,  including more than 283 million masks, 287 million gloves,  513 million ounces of hand sanitizer, 450 million ounces of  sanitizing spray, 1.5 trillion wipes, 351,000 thermometers,  and 16,500 thermal cameras. As part of our effort to keep  our front-line employees safe, we built our own COVID-19  testing capabilities and have the capacity to conduct tens of  thousands of tests per day across hundreds of sites. We are  also advocating for COVID-19 vaccinations for our front-line  employees, including team members working in fulfillment  and data centers and at our Whole Foods Market stores. To support our global front-line employees who continue  to deliver critical supplies to customers, we provided more  than $2.5 billion in bonuses and incentives in 2020. We  offer company-subsidized child and adult backup care to  full-time and part-time  and Whole Foods Market  employees in the U.S.  An employee diagnosed with  COVID-19 receives up to two weeks of paid time off, in  addition to their other paid and unpaid time off options. We also established a $25 million relief fund to support  
As part of ’s commitment to help India fight the  second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, we provided  oxygen concentrators, oximeters, and other critical supplies  to employees in need. worked with partners to  deliver more than 8,000 oxygen concentrators and 500  BiPAP machines from Singapore to hospitals and public  institutions supporting patients infected with COVID-19  across India. also procured 100 ventilators for  hospitals with the most urgent needs and worked with  the equipment manufacturer to install, maintain, and train  personnel to use the machines. We provided additional  leave for associates who tested positive for the virus  and expanded India’s sick leave policy to cover leave for  caregivers. Safety of our customers and teams in India  continues to be our top priority. Having dropped out of high school to help support his  family, Andre Grass was an  packer who enrolled in  the Associate2Tech (A2Tech) program in 2017. A2Tech is  a 90-day program, paid for by , that is designed to  give fulfillment center associates a way to move into a more  highly skilled career by providing the training and industry  certification needed to make it happen. The program  includes opportunities to shadow another technician and  gain hands-on experience in IT as a support technician. During the program associates have about eight hours a  week to take online courses while at work. Andre completed  his A2Tech training and certifications in three months and  became an IT support engineer. “Since graduating from the  program, I’ve had the opportunity to launch new sites and  work on projects that improved overall customer experience,  and have been promoted to the next level within IT.” 
As of June 2021,  employed more than 40,000  veterans and military spouses across the U.S., surpassing  the Joining Forces Pledge we made in 2016 to hire 25,000  veterans and military spouses over the next five years, and  to train 10,000 active duty service members, veterans,  and military spouses. provides a Military Leave  of Absence to all eligible serving employees, including  differential pay, continued healthcare coverage, and job  protection. military employees across the U.S.  have served more than 20,000 days in the Reserves and  National Guard in 2020, from serving as aircraft technicians  transporting COVID-19 patients, to assembling essential  COVID-19 test kits. LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW WE ARE SUPPORTING   OUR EMPLOYEES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON  OUR COVID-19 VACCINATION AND TESTING BLOG We aim to be Earth’s safest place to work. We are committed  to ensuring the safety and well-being of all   employees every day. Our work environment allows  almost anyone—regardless of background, skill level, or  experience—to work with confidence. Everyone at  shares ownership in creating a safe  workplace, and we invest in resources to help our employees  thrive. We are constantly evaluating new technologies and  learning opportunities to optimize how employees and  leaders build capabilities, receive critical safety information,  and prepare to meet future challenges. Investing in Safety 
Our safety performance is possible because of the drive and  commitment of our operations employees and our 6,200  safety professionals, who are dedicated to using the science  of safety to solve complex problems and establish new  industry best practices. Beyond building a strong safety team, we invested more  than $11.5 billion in COVID-19-related measures to  help keep employees safe in 2020. We also committed  an additional $125 million to non-COVID-19-related  safety capital projects, such as vehicle safety controls and  engineered ergonomic solutions. In 2021, we will invest over  $300 million in new and continuing safety projects, including  an initial $66.5 million investment to create technology  that helps avoid powered industrial truck collisions and  significantly improve forklift safety. Safety Design and Technologies 
We design and create new solutions to continuously  reinforce and improve safety in our operations. This includes  
integrating new and advanced technologies that increase  safety at every step of ’s process, from receiving  vendor shipments to sorting multiple packages into  shipments ready for delivery. Six to 18 months before opening a new site, we scrutinize  every safety and engineering detail to limit potential hazards  and lower risk. When opening new facilities, we only launch  sites after they have successfully passed 2,500 safety  checkpoints. We have strict equipment and machine design,  installation, testing, and compliance standards. We regularly  review those standards with manufacturers and vendors. fulfillment facilities are equipped with a variety of  technologies to reduce physical demands on our employees. For example, we use custom-designed tables that lift items  electronically, keeping employees from having to bend over  to pick up objects to place on conveyors. We also developed  wearable technologies to protect our employees on the job. We provide intelligent safety vests for employees who  work alongside robotic pods, which use short-range radio  frequencies to send signals to the robots to slow down,  alter their work, or stop when they detect employees  nearby. We developed a similar wearable vest for grocery  delivery fulfillment facilities in North America that tracks  how long employees spend inside freezers in order to  limit their cold exposure. Beyond our facilities, our delivery network is powered  by thousands of small businesses and drivers who rely  on ’s technology and safety initiatives every day. Our vehicles are fitted with camera safety technology,  use artificial intelligence to capture real-time road  conditions, and identify at-risk driving events. These  technologies are used to help keep drivers and the  communities where we deliver safe. When we piloted  this technology from April to October 2020 on more  than 2 million miles of delivery routes, we found that  crashes decreased 48%, stop sign violations decreased  20%, driving without a seatbelt decreased 60%, and  distracted driving decreased 45%. Musculoskeletal Disorders 
Nearly 40% of work-related injuries at  are  classified as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), such as  sprains or strains due to repetitive motion. This type of  injury is common with the type of work that we do and is  most likely to occur during an employee’s first six months  at . This insight has inspired some of our most  significant safety, health, and wellness initiatives and  technologies to date. Among these initiatives is our WorkingWell program,  where we educate new employees about their bodies,  health, and wellness to help them successfully adapt to  working at . This program is available at 350 sites,  reaching more than 850,000 associates and contributing  to reducing ’s overall MSD recordable incident  rates in 2020. WorkingWell has received positive feedback  from 88% of associates, and we are expanding the  program in 2021, with the aim of cutting our recordable  incident rates by 50% by 2025. We are committed to utilizing our distinctive  technological capabilities, embracing our expertise in  health and wellness, and collaborating with proven  thought leaders and scientists to lead the way for  workplaces around the world to proactively manage and  prevent work-related injuries. At , we value diversity, equity, and inclusion. We  believe these values are good for business and, more  fundamentally, are simply right. customers have  many intersecting identities, and we serve them better with  a diverse and inclusive workforce. Our diverse perspectives  help us push each other to think bigger, and differently,  about the products and services we build for our customers  and the day-to-day nature of our workplace. Our Approach to Diversity,   Equity, and Inclusion 
We take very seriously our commitment to respect and  value people from all backgrounds, including gender, race,  ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and disability. We  serve diverse customers, operate in diverse communities,  and rely on a diverse workforce. Diversity, equity, and  inclusion are cornerstones of our continued success and  critical components of our culture. Our ability to innovate  on behalf of our customers relies on the perspectives  and knowledge of people from all backgrounds, and the  policies and procedures we have in place for our employees,  selling partners, suppliers, and customers highlight our  commitment and approach. Like many companies and institutions, we have more work  to do on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but we believe we  are on the right path. We have initiated numerous near-term  and long-term programs and strategies across key aspects  of our business to increase diversity and representation  in our workforce, expand our efforts to build an inclusive  culture, and address racial justice. We are committed to increasing representation of employees  from diverse backgrounds at every level of our organization. We know that diverse leaders attract and retain diverse  teams, so we focus our efforts on hiring, retention, growth,  and development, including promotion of our employees. In 2020, we set and met goals to double the representation  of Black directors and vice presidents, launch inclusion  training for all ians, and remove racially insensitive  language in our tech documentation. We work with strategic  partners focused on representation, including Management  Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a nonprofit organization  that works to strengthen recruitment and retention of Black,  Latinx, and Native American employees. We are joining other  employers in the MLT Black Equity at Work Certification, a  new standard that requires employers to assess and make  meaningful progress toward achieving Black equity internally  while supporting Black equity in society. Building on last year’s work, in 2021, we set company-wide  goals for diversity, equity, and inclusion. We set goals for our  vice president team to inspect any statistically significant  demographic differences in 2021 first-quarter performance  ratings and, on a monthly basis, any statistically significant  demographic differences in attrition and low performance  actions to identify root causes and, as necessary, implement  action plans. We also set a goal to retain employees at  statistically similar rates across all demographics. We will  build a scalable mechanism in Connections, an employee  feedback mechanism, to inspect inclusion sentiment by  demographic for all employees and we will ensure that  100% of ians take company-wide, required inclusion  training. We will build scalable mechanisms that address  new instances of non-inclusive terms in our code. For the second year in a row, we set a goal to double the  number of U.S. Black employees in Level 8 (director) and  Level 10 (vice president) positions year over year from  2020 numbers. We also set a goal to increase hiring of  U.S. Black employees in Level 4 through Level 7 positions  by at least 30% year over year from 2020 hiring. Our  goal is to increase the number of women at Level 8 and  Level 10 positions—including senior principals, directors,  vice presidents, and distinguished engineers—in tech and  science roles by 30% year over year. We also set a goal to  increase the number of U.S. Black software development  engineer interns by at least 40%. These goals represent the next step in ’s diversity,  equity, and inclusion journey, not the final destination. It is  going to take time and consistent focus to get where we  want to be. Additionally, these goals represent only a slice  of ’s ongoing work in this area. Owners from across  the company are focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion,  from the way we select vendors and financial partners,  to the way we use our online store to support our selling  partners, to the way we roll out products and media to the  world. We are using the same mechanisms that we use  for our most important business initiatives to build a truly  inclusive and equitable workplace, setting goals and holding  regular reviews to ensure our progress. Since June 2020, the  majority of the S-Team, ’s top executives, has met  biweekly to scrutinize our progress toward reaching these  goals and removing barriers to delivery. At , we are  working to shape a more equitable and inclusive future. To better understand what inclusion means for our  employees, we conducted a global internal survey which led  to ’s definition of inclusion: “Being valued, trusted,  connected, and informed so that we can deliver the best  results for our customers.” We use this definition to guide  us as we create educational initiatives, continually improve  our mentorship program, and deliver benefits for all of our  employees. has 13 employee-led affinity groups, comprised  of more than 90,000 employees in hundreds of chapters  globally who passionately and positively impact our  company. Each affinity group has executive sponsors who  support them in engaging at every level of the company. Groups include  People with Disabilities;   Women in Engineering; Asians@; Black Employee  Network; Body Positive Peers; Families@; Glamazon  (for LGBTQIA+ employees and allies); Indigenous@ ; Latinos@; Mental Health and Well-Being;  Warriors@; Women@; and Women in  Finance Initiative. We engage and consult their leaders  and seek their ideas to improve our inclusion efforts  internally and externally. We are proud that our efforts have  received recognition from the Human Rights Campaign’s  Corporate Equality Index; the NAACP Equity, Inclusion, and  Empowerment Index; and the Disability Equality Index. Indigenous@ is an inclusive employee affinity group  dedicated to making an impact that celebrates and elevates  diverse Indigenous cultures. The group fosters a community of  Indigenous employees and allies through networking and shared  experiences with the goal to make  the premier employer  for Indigenous people by increasing recruitment, representation,  and retention of Indigenous people at . In 2020, the  group participated in ’s Represent the Future Summit, a  career enrichment summit designed to uplift Native American,  Black, and Latinx professionals through participation in sessions on  building the future through innovation and on why representation  and authenticity matter. Indigenous@ also works with  a variety of nonprofit organizations to support the growth and  development of Indigenous Peoples and communities. This  support ranges from donations to tribal communities impacted by  current events to offering coding camps for Native Americans. The inequitable and brutal treatment of Black people  is unacceptable. We stand in solidarity with our Black  employees, customers, and partners. We are committed to  helping build a country and a world where everyone can live  with dignity and free from fear. We will continue to support  regulation that eliminates the unjust targeting of people  based on race, including the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act, policies that protect and expand voting rights and  provide better health and educational outcomes for Black  and Brown communities around the world. donated $10 million to organizations working to  bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and  African Americans. Recipients—selected with the help of  ’s Black Employee Network (BEN)—include groups  focused on combating systemic racism through the legal  system as well as those dedicated to expanding educational  and economic opportunity for Black communities. This initial  donation was followed by a successful employee donation  matching program that resulted in an additional $17 million  going to these organizations in 2020. While it will take years  of thoughtful focus and partnership to make the progress  needed,  is committed to being part of the solution. is proud to sign on to the Asian American and Pacific  Islander (AAPI) Giving Challenge, joining leaders in business  as a corporate partner for the launch of The Asian American  Foundation (TAAF), a new nonprofit organization committed  to accelerating opportunity and prosperity for Asian American  and Pacific Islander communities. TAAF focuses on anti-hate  efforts, data and research, and education. proudly  supports the foundation’s stated mission of serving the  community in the pursuit of belonging and prosperity, free  from discrimination, slander, and violence. Enhancing Opportunity 
We are invested in building out the next generation of  diverse leaders. As part of our $50 million investment in  computer science and STEM education, our  Future  Engineer program inspires, educates, and prepares children  and young adults from underrepresented and underserved  communities to pursue computer science. In 2021, we set a  goal to reach 1.6 million underrepresented students globally  through  Future Engineer with real world-inspired  virtual and hands-on computer science project learning. We  actively partner with organizations and academic institutions  that reach underrepresented communities like Historically  Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving  Institutions (HSIs), women’s colleges, and tribal colleges. This includes hosting hiring fairs in underrepresented  communities around the world and committing to the HBCU  Partnership Challenge to support greater engagement  between private companies and HBCUs. Asians@ provides a support structure and network for  Pan-Asian communities. The group helps recruit, onboard, and  connect employees of Asian descent across geographies by  sharing experiences and providing access to career development,  networking, and community building opportunities. They also  host local community and recruiting events. For example, in  2021 the group hosted an inclusion town hall to address the  increased blame, racism, and xenophobia faced by Asian and  Pacific Islanders after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The  event focused on healing and allyship, providing resources, and  advocating for inclusion through anti-racist art and spoken word  performances. We are also empowering women to lead in the  technology industry. AWS has partnered with Girls in Tech,  a global nonprofit committed to eliminating the gender  gap in an industry where only 26% of computer scientists  are women. Girls in Tech is among the organizations  pushing hardest to provide women with access to jobs in  technology through education, professional development,  and community-building experiences. To enhance these  efforts, AWS supports the Girls in Tech annual conference,  its Digital Career Fair, a virtual hackathon focused on  creating real-world technical solutions powered by  women, and AMPLIFY, a startup pitch competition that  helps entrepreneurs with funding and mentorship. ’s focus on accessibility has made shopping and  other daily experiences simpler for people with disabilities. We believe technology should be inclusive, accessible, and  useful to everyone. By inventing new experiences that support  all of our customers, we help create a more accessible world. While there’s much more to do, we continue to build accessibility  features across our devices and services around the world and  have been recognized for our efforts with the 2019 American  Foundation for the Blind Helen Keller Achievement Award. Empowering Diverse Entrepreneurs 
Through the  business credentialing program,  minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, and  LGBTQIA+-owned small businesses can promote their  products. Customers can shop at storefronts that support  women-owned businesses and Black-owned businesses, as  well as at the  Saheli store, which displays products  from women entrepreneurs in India. LGBTQIA+ Rights  
The rights of LGBTQIA+ people must be protected. We  were early and strong supporters of marriage equality  and will continue to advocate for protections and equal  rights for transgender people. We stand together with  the LGBTQIA+ community and are working at the  U.S. federal and state levels on legislation, including  supporting passage of the Equality Act. provides  gender transition benefits based on the Standards of  Care published by the World Professional Association  for Transgender Health. holds a gender identity  conference to build community, educate those outside  of the LGBTQIA+ community, and provide professional  development opportunities for those at   while transitioning openly in the workplace. We have  a Transgender Toolkit for transgender and non-binary  identifying employees, and we provide transgender- inclusive health benefits for  employees. We are  proud to have our efforts recognized, scoring 100% on  the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index  for LGBTQ rights for the last three years. ” 
This is just one small step  I am taking to help end  systemic racism. I feel honored and  grateful to work for an  employer that shares  these same values. ’s leadership and BEN  have worked hand-in-hand to  identify organizations in the Black  community that make a difference  and will contribute to them in a  meaningful way. In addition to  the organizations chosen, we will  work with our chapters to identify  local groups to support. We will  continue conversations about how   can support employees  and the Black community. Building on our Leadership Principle of Learn and Be Curious,  we organize conferences every year where employees can  learn and exchange their ideas and experiences. Several of  these conferences focused specifically on diversity issues. Represent the Future is a career enrichment summit  centered around uplifting Black, Latinx, and Native Amer- ican communities. This event is open to participants from  any organization around the world to learn more about  ’s customer-obsessed culture of diversity and  inclusion that inspires everything we do. Recruiters and  hiring managers from across  share insights about  ’s 14 Leadership Principles, current job opportuni- ties, and our application and interview process. Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE+) is a  global brand of internal experiences that focuses on  deepening  employees’ understanding of sys- temic barriers through conversations on topics related  to intersectional identities, including race, ethnicity, and  gender, with additional focus on nationality, ability, sexual  orientation, military status, religion, age, and language. Global Diversity Summit is a professional  development experience for ’s diversity, equity,  and inclusion global practitioners. This event focuses on  industry-leading research, ideas, and mechanisms related  to race, ethnicity, and social justice and highlights best  practices pioneered by various business units. Global Accessibility Awareness Month is recognized  each May at . Around the world, the month is full  of events, technical talks, experiential trainings, podcasts,  and workshops that showcase accessibility best practices. Employees take time throughout the month to learn about  accessibility, even if it is not a part of their day-to-day work. AmazeWIT is a conference we host in India, bringing  together women technologists, including ’s tech- nical leaders and external guests. The day-long event fo- cuses on technology deep dives (including voice technol- ogy, machine learning, Fire OS, and others) and leadership  discussions with senior ians and peer companies. We track the  representation of women  and underrepresented  communities because  we know that diversity  helps us build better  teams that obsess over  and better represent our  global customer base. We have made year-over- year progress, and we  will continue to strive  for better representation  across our company. Pay Equity   prioritizes pay equity. A review of the compensation  awarded in 2020 at , including base pay, cash bonuses,  and stock, shows that women employees in the U.S. were on  par in pay equity with men, earning a dollar for every dollar  that men earned performing the same jobs, and minorities  earned 99.2 cents for every dollar that white employees earned  performing these same jobs. The data included here is a three-year trend of our global   gender and U.S. race and ethnicity data as of December 31, 2020. Consistent, honest, and open communication with our  employees allows us to continuously improve our workplace  experience, empowering individuals to raise concerns and  have them directly addressed by leadership. Our goal is to  hear from and listen to everyone. Below are some of the many ways an  employee  can choose to communicate with management. Open Door Philosophy 
We believe candid and constructive communication in an  environment of mutual respect is essential to our collective  success. We have an open-door policy, which means  we welcome and encourage any employee to discuss  suggestions, concerns, or feedback with their manager,  a Human Resources team member, or any member of  ’s leadership team. Voice of the Associate Boards 
Voice of the Associate boards are in  fulfillment  centers around the globe—physically and virtually— providing employees a forum for expressing their concerns,  offering suggestions, and asking questions on a daily basis  to leadership. Leadership teams reply directly to questions,  promoting dialogue and efficient remediation of issues. In  2020, our managers received and responded to more than  245,000 comments, questions, and issues raised on the  Voice of the Associate boards. Connections 
Connections is a real-time, company-wide employee  feedback mechanism designed to listen to and learn from  employees at scale to improve the employee experience. Each day, Connections questions are delivered to every  
 employee on a computer, a workstation device, or  hand scanner generating more than 1.2 million responses  from employees daily. Employees may choose to answer  or not answer any question, and individual responses are  aggregated and shared with managers at the team level to  maintain confidentiality. Connections analyzes response data  and provides insights to managers and leaders to review  and take actions as they uncover issues or see opportunities  to improve. Employees respond to Connections questions  at more than 3,000 unique locations in 53 countries, and  questions are delivered in 26 languages. Managers receive Connections data on a dashboard that  looks like this, which shows aggregated responses for a  specific set of questions:    
In the U.S. and Canada, ’s appeals process is a dispute  resolution mechanism for employees in certain stages of our  fulfillment network to challenge certain disciplinary actions  involving final written warnings and terminations. A second  level manager or general manager may review the issues  raised in an appeal, including management decisions, to  determine if a policy or practice was applied properly and  consistently. If not, we will remediate the issue consistent with our policies and practices. In June 2020, we introduced an  online paperless appeal process, providing a more accessible  experience for employees. Ethics Hotline 
In performing their job duties,  employees should  always act lawfully, ethically, and in the best interests of  . The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of  Conduct) sets out basic guiding principles for all employees. Employees may raise questions or report suspected violations  of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics through  ’s Ethics Line globally, by phone or online. The Ethics  Line is the second most utilized method for employees to  raise concerns, and employees have used 30 of the 165  languages available to do so. Reports to the Ethics Line are  answered by an independent third party and may be made  
anonymously on request. Our Business Conduct and Ethics  team records, reviews, and directs for investigation calls for  potential violations of the Code and tracks cases through  to remediation when necessary. Certain allegations of  violations of the Code are also reported up to either the  Audit Committee or the Leadership Development and  Compensation Committee. Executive Escalations 
Suggestions or complaints emailed to a member of the  senior leadership team are considered Executive Escalations. Any employee can utilize this method of providing a  suggestion or raising a concern to leadership. All escalations  are independently reviewed by Human Resources, used as a  learning opportunity, and may be used to update our  processes to prevent gaps in the future. Annual surveys ask employees to anonymously express  opinions about issues in the workplace, and managers  respond by remediating issues or making improvements. Regular In-Person Meetings While  Maintaining Social Distancing 
Through all-hands meetings with general managers,  stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and one-on- one meetings, employees have daily opportunities to  engage with leaders, raise issues, and make suggestions  to continually improve our workplace. Associate Roundtables  
The purpose of Associate Roundtable meetings is to provide  leaders and associates with a meaningful opportunity to  discuss issues. Leaders hear directly from hourly associates,  who can ask questions about any topic and get immediate  feedback. Associates are able to share their thoughts of  their job, their work environment, and any challenges they  face. The leadership team uses the information to improve  the workplace and the associate experience. Associate Forums 
In Associate Forums—active in a number of countries,  including the UK, Poland, and Slovakia—associates, elected  by their peers, meet regularly with management to discuss  associate ideas, issues, and concerns, and engage in  projects and activities to build employee engagement. Freedom of Association 
We respect freedom of association and our employees’  right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other  lawful organization of their own selection, without fear  of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights  should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful  manner. has a variety of elected associate  forums and work councils around the world, and  
 has associates represented by some form of  collective bargaining in many countries. In the first  quarter of 2021, the National Labor Relations Board  oversaw a union vote at our fulfillment center in  Bessemer, Alabama. In the end, employees made the  choice to vote against joining a union; less than 16% of  employees voted to support joining the union. We value worker feedback, and are committed to  providing our employees with grievance mechanisms  and remedial action, regardless of collective bargaining  presence. We firmly believe it is in the best interests of  our employees and our company to continue our direct  communications, and the best way to effect positive  change is for our employees and managers to continue  working together directly. We work hard to listen to our  employees, make continuous improvements, and invest  heavily to offer competitive pay and benefits in a safe  and inclusive workplace.  is strongly committed to conducting our business  in a lawful and ethical manner, including engaging with  suppliers who respect human rights, provide safe and  inclusive workplaces, and promote a sustainable future. Selling partners are third-party sellers and retail vendors  who offer products for sale in ’s stores. Our Supply  Chain Standards apply to every product sold in our stores  and we expect selling partners to do their own due diligence,  ensuring every product is produced in safe, healthy, and  inclusive work environments. We evaluate credible allegations  or reports of selling partner violations of our Supply Chain  Standards, including but not limited to those published by  governments, reputable investigators, journalists, or human  rights defenders. If we have reason to suspect certain  products do not meet our Supply Chain Standards, we may  request that the selling partner demonstrate the products  it sells in our store were manufactured in accordance with  ’s Supply Chain Standards, such as providing evidence  of auditing protocols, showing processes for assessing  factory working conditions, engaging in unannounced audits,  participating in an approved industry association that includes  factory monitoring, or verifying where the products are made. Our goal is for our products and services to be provided in a  way that respects human rights and the environment. Our  global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate  our standards and help suppliers build their capacity to  provide working environments that are safe and respectful  of human rights. Our Approach  
Our standards reflect that we are committed to respecting  and supporting the UN Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of  Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the ILO, and the  ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at  Work. To ensure our policies and programs incorporate  these internationally recognized human rights standards,  we conduct formal benchmarking with industry peers and  multi-stakeholder organizations to continually improve our  program. At least every three years in line with industry best  practices, we review our Supply Chain Standards against  policies developed by industry associations (such as the  Responsible Business Alliance and the Consumer Goods  Forum) and in consultation with external stakeholders,  including Nest, Business for Social Responsibility, Impactt  Limited, and Verité. We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements  and expectations for our suppliers, their supply chains,  and selling partners who list products in our stores. They are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous  improvement, and supply chain accountability. We  engage with suppliers that are committed to these  same principles; suppliers are subject to these standards  as a condition of doing business with us. We believe supply chain transparency is essential to our  approach to human rights due diligence and to ensuring  worker protections. The suppliers that produce - branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage,  and home goods products are shown on our supply chain  map, which is updated annually and is available for download. We publish a supplier list to provide customers and external  stakeholders visibility into where we source and to contribute  to transparency efforts across industries. When we receive  information about potential issues in our supply chain, we  investigate and take appropriate action to remediate. Risk Assessments 
We routinely evaluate our supply chain to understand the  highest risks to workers and prioritize our efforts. To do this,  we engage key internal and external stakeholders, analyze  our risks using international risk indices such as the World  Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, run worker surveys,  and conduct assessments that include worker interviews,  management interviews, document review, and on-site visits. We regularly consult industry experts to review our approach  to risk assessment against globally recognized international  standards and industry best practices. Supplier Assessments  
Our Responsible Sourcing Program focuses on suppliers of  -branded products, consisting of  Private  Brands,  devices, and a curated selection of brands  exclusively sold in ’s store. Through this program,  we engage in robust supplier due diligence, prioritizing  mechanisms that drive continuous improvement. We are  committed to working with our suppliers to remedy issues  and establish systems to prevent future issues. We expect  our suppliers to consistently monitor and enforce our  standards in their own operations and supply chain as well  as make improvements to meet or exceed our expectations. We use independent auditors to verify supplier compliance  with our Supply Chain Standards though regular on-site  inspections and confidential worker interviews. Our approach is based on a commitment to workers and to  continuous improvement; we put the safety and interests  of workers first. Suppliers are required to meaningfully  
participate in any investigation and take immediate action  in the event that issues are found. An acceptable corrective  action plan details the root cause of the issue and the steps,  both short-term and long-term, supplier management will  take to fix it. In most situations, we will support suppliers  through the remediation process, but where a supplier  refuses to remediate, we may choose to terminate the  relationship. Failure to meet our standards has been a factor  in our decision to terminate hundreds of suppliers. Learn more about our process in our Supplier Manual,  which provides guidance and resources to suppliers of  -branded products on how to meet and exceed the  expectations outlined in our Supply Chain Standards. We assess our suppliers of -branded products  across four main categories: 1) Labor, 2) Health and Safety,  3) Environment, and 4) Ethics. These categories are divided  into subcategories, such as non-discrimination, emergency  preparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. Findings within each subcategory are flagged as High,  Medium, or Low depending on the level of severity. focuses on setting a high bar for new suppliers and  refusing to go to production until suppliers remediate High  level findings identified in our assessments. We recognize  that some issues may take time to effectively remediate. For  Medium level issues, we expect suppliers to show they are  making meaningful progress toward remediation within a  defined timeline. For Low level issues, we monitor   
suppliers for continuous improvement. We have dedicated  teams based in key sourcing countries around the globe  that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to  challenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek  to create long-term relationships with suppliers who align  with our values and are committed to constantly improving  conditions for workers. Where we see trends in issues  beyond individual suppliers, such as widespread health  and safety deficits or industry-wide failures to responsibly  protect migrant workers, we work to define regional or  global strategies to address underlying systemic challenges. In 2020, we restructured our program to respond to the  social and economic crises our suppliers and their workers  faced because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting Workers, Suppliers,   and Communities During COVID-19 
 is committed to supporting our suppliers, their  workers, and their communities as they are impacted by  COVID-19. Of course, the global COVID-19 pandemic made  2020 a particularly challenging year, as suppliers faced  massive supply chain disruption, workers were displaced,  and communities experienced unimaginable loss. We  immediately went to work to address these challenges. We adapted our due diligence. In 2020, we had to  change how we assessed suppliers. With COVID-19  restrictions, it was much harder to conduct on-site  assessments. We continued to utilize traditional audits  when it was safe to do so, but when on-site audits became  challenging or impossible due to safety restrictions, we  adopted new mechanisms to assess risk, including self- assessment questionnaires and remote document review. We engaged suppliers. We developed guidance and  trainings for suppliers on how to support and protect  workers during the pandemic. We educated managers on  workplace hygiene and proper use of personal protective  equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We  also encouraged suppliers to continue pay for workers  during shutdowns, recognizing the extraordinary toll layoffs  are taking on the workforce. We invested in workers. In 2020, we created a $1.3  million fund to invest in organizations providing critical  frontline support to workers impacted by COVID-19. For example, we provided support to organizations like  the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in  Bangladesh to distribute medical supplies and COVID- 19-related resources for frontline doctors, nurses, and  medical workers operating in the largest refugee camp in  the world. The contribution supported the procurement  of lifesaving PPE—approximately 322,000 gloves,  16,000 gowns and coveralls, 18,300 N95 respirators,  and 119,000 face shields—for 23 IOM-managed health  facilities, serving to benefit both refugee and host  community populations in the region. We listened to workers. We increased our investment in  Amader Kotha, meaning ‘Our Voice’ in Bengali, a helpline  that provides workers in the Bangladesh ready-made  garment sector a safe and effective way to report and  resolve workplace issues. In 2020, we enrolled 23   suppliers in Amader Kotha’s program. For every worker  call, the helpline follows a defined protocol to address the  reported issue until it is resolved with their employer. For example, in December 2020, Amader Kotha received a  call from a worker employed with one of our Bangladesh  suppliers. The worker reported verbal and physical abuse  and retaliatory firing when they refused to complete  overtime after regular work hours. Amader Kotha  immediately connected with the supplier’s compliance team  to investigate the issue. As a result, the supplier rehired  the aggrieved worker and dismissed the two employees  who had harassed them. In 2021, we will enroll additional   suppliers with Amader Kotha and launch training  for workers on how to make use of this resource. We engaged in responsible purchasing practices   and learned about impact to workers. Since the  beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,  has  honored all orders to our global suppliers from our  U.S. and European private-label apparel businesses. We  also worked with Better Buying, an initiative working to  improve purchasing practices in global supply chains, to  conduct a survey of our suppliers in Vietnam and their  workers on the impacts of our practices during COVID-19. We received more than 1,300 worker responses,  indicating that their primary concerns were unstable  personal finances related to business uncertainty during  COVID-19, changes to forecasted orders, and factory  safety concerns linked to shipment date pressures. Suppliers gave positive feedback on several aspects of our  practices, including our increased communication during  COVID-19, decisions to honor orders, and flexibility on  delivery times. Commodity Traceability 
In 2020, we continued to map deeper tiers of our  -branded product supply chains in order to  identify the most salient and material risks. Commodity  supply chains are complicated and fragmented, and  improved visibility into raw material supply chains enables  businesses to identify human rights and labor rights  violations and hold suppliers accountable. We focused on cotton. In 2020, we strengthened  our efforts on cotton. has joined other brands  as a member of Better Cotton Initiative’s Retailer and  Brand Advisory Panel on Traceability. In 2021,  is  sponsoring and participating in the RSN initiative YESS: Yarn  Ethically & Sustainably Sourced. YESS works to address forced  labor in the cotton value chain by providing training to, and  managing the assessment of, spinners and fabric mills to  identify and address forced labor in cotton production. We focused on minerals. In 2020, we became a  member of the Public-Private Alliance for the Responsible  Minerals Trade (PPA), and expanded our participation in  the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We committed  to supporting the PPA’s on-the-ground efforts to promote  responsible trade, and became active members of RMI’s  working groups on Smelter Engagement and Cobalt due  diligence. Health and safety issues have always been a key focus  of our Responsible Sourcing Program, and COVID-19  demonstrated the importance of health and safety  standards in protecting worker well-being. At the onset of COVID-19,  partnered with Swasti,  a global nonprofit committed to ensuring access to quality  healthcare for workers in marginalized communities. Swasti  adjusted its worker well-being program to provide support  to workers in factories impacted by COVID-19. With our  support, Swasti set up a worker helpline, developed health  protocols for workers to return to work safely, and provided  critical mental health, healthcare, and social entitlement  support to workers, their families and their communities. Swasti trained worker-led response teams on COVID-19  
prevention and management; the teams educated other  workers by showing videos on the factory floor and posting  critical health information. Swasti also provided remote  healthcare to workers and reached out to workers and their  family members to identify COVID-19 risks and provide  medical support. When Swasti identified a pandemic- related food shortage at a program site, it distributed food  to employees who were in need. Aside from COVID-19 specific work, Swasti also provides  workers with primary healthcare and programs on gender  equity, financial inclusion, and strengthening workers  committees at sites to promote better communication  channels between management and workers. In 2020,  partnered with Nest, a nonprofit  supporting the growth and development of the global  artisan sector to build a world of greater gender equity  and economic inclusion. We supported Nest’s PPE  Purchasing Initiative—a program that purchased over  200,000 protective masks from artisan and maker  businesses for delivery to front-line workers. In 2020, this  program provided over $500,000 in economic relief to 57  businesses, employing 10,510 skilled artisans. We also partnered with Nest to provide more than 100  COVID-19 economic relief grants to artisan businesses  around the globe. For example, Nest provided a grant  to Indego Africa, an organization that provides artisans  with a global market for their handmade products and  educational opportunities for women-owned businesses  in Africa. Sapna Shah, Indego Africa’s Director of Brand  and Operating Strategy, shared that because of this  funding, Indego Africa was able to provide consistent  purchase orders to the company’s artisan partners for  their handmade products, protecting them from economic  disruption due to COVID-19. As part of its grant program, Nest also supported a Digital  Marketing Fellowship for Kay Kay’s Fashion, a Black-owned,  woman-owned hair accessories company in Southfield,  Michigan. When applying to the program, business owner  Kelechi Uchendu outlined her need as: “strengthen[ing] my  brand DNA and also working on increasing my business  to consumer sales.” Nest matched Uchendu with an  integrated marketer and brand strategist with 10 years  of experience in e-commerce. Together, they developed a  project plan, resulting in updated language for Uchendu’s  business website, a brand presentation she could use for  marketing, and tools to help Kay Kay’s Fashion deepen its  online presence. Nest distributed another Digital Marketing Fellowship grant  to a woman-owned small business Espacio Handmade,  an Austin, Texas, company specializing in leather goods  sourced from and crafted in the U.S. Nest matched the  
company’s owner, Katrina Marhefka with a professional  digital marketing agency that helped her launch a  successful e-mail marketing campaign. Marhefka is a  business leader and a maker who is proud to hire women. “Leatherworking is seen as such a male-dominated skill. Not anymore!” she says. Marhefka’s participation in the  fellowship helped her develop systems and identify  business opportunities. Handmade, a destination in our online store that  specializes in handcrafted goods, has launched a program  to highlight the work of Nest artisan businesses, including  Indego Africa, Kay Kay’s Fashion, and Espacio Handmade,  providing access to selling and growth opportunities. One of the major things  that I learned was how  to brand my company  properly and how to clean  up my website so that   it really showcases   my brand. We evaluate our supply chain to identify the industries,  countries, and issues where we have the greatest  opportunities to identify and address risks and have a  positive impact on workers. In the event that we identify  an issue in our supply chain, we act fast and prioritize  solutions from the workers’ point of view. We work with  industry partners to tackle systemic issues and implement  programs that support continuous improvement for our  suppliers and workers. As a part of our due diligence  efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse impacts,  we leverage internal and external data and guidance from  external stakeholders, including industry experts, civil  society groups, and non-governmental organizations. We are committed to assessing our impact and focusing  our efforts in the following key commitment areas:    Safe Workplaces  
Safe and healthy workplaces are a top priority for . We have global teams who partner with suppliers to  increase worker awareness of safety issues, promote  worker participation in their facility’s safety culture, and  promote initiatives focused on the well-being of workers  on issues that matter most to them. Our suppliers must provide workers with a safe and  healthy work environment; suppliers must, at a minimum,  comply with applicable laws regarding working conditions. Additionally, we are committed to driving improvement in  these key priority areas: (1) occupational safety, including  adequate machine safeguarding, and ensuring suppliers  continually identify, evaluate, and control physically  demanding tasks to ensure that worker health and safety is  not jeopardized; (2) emergency preparedness and response  
planning; and (3) sanitation and housing; if suppliers  provide residential facilities for their workers, they must  provide clean and safe accommodations. We conduct on-site assessments of -branded  suppliers to determine safety conditions throughout  our business relationship. This includes assessments  of protections such as adequate fire safety systems,  sanitary dormitories and facilities, and adequate machine  safeguarding. We require that these suppliers address  material safety issues prior to beginning production with  . Assessment results are reviewed regularly by the  leadership of our -branded businesses, and corrective  action plans are implemented with suppliers as needed. In 2020, we expanded our work with the ILO’s Sustaining  Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) program,  a lean manufacturing program focused on improving  productivity and working conditions in small- and medium- sized manufacturers. At the onset of the pandemic, SCORE training helped factories plan their production schedule,  reorganize production lines, and implement guidelines for  more social distance and increased safety. We worked with  suppliers in India and China to provide them training and  assistance in implementing improvement plans across five  areas: workplace cooperation, health and safety, quality  management, clean production, and human resources. Through SCORE, we have provided training on workplace  health and safety to 4,398 workers in our supply chain. To date,  suppliers enrolled in SCORE training  have completed 1,517 projects to improve workplace  health and safety, drawing from the 1,219 improvement  recommendations submitted by workers. So far, eight sites  have achieved SCORE participation certificates from SCORE  Academy, demonstrating they have integrated SCORE  methodology into their policies and operations. Freely Chosen Employment  
We will not tolerate the use of forced labor in our supply  chain. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of  forced labor and human trafficking; this includes charging  workers recruitment fees, holding passports or personal  documentation, and coercion to work through threats of  deportation or contacting immigration authorities. During  assessments of -branded suppliers, we track  where workers migrated from and how much they paid  in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, we require the  supplier to reimburse workers in full. Forced labor is a hidden  crime that is hard to combat. We recognize real progress  in this space will only be achieved through collaborative  action—by companies, governments, and civil society—to  spur system-wide change. Learn more about our approach  to forced labor in our annual Modern Slavery Statement. is currently working with these organizations to  devise holistic approaches to combating forced labor. Polaris:  supports Polaris, a non-profit that  assists trafficking victims and survivors. Through the U.S.  National Human Trafficking Hotline, Polaris has have  identified and responded to more than 63,000 cases of  human trafficking and labor exploitation since 2007. AWS  works with Polaris to infuse cutting-edge technology into  its infrastructure to accelerate the development of the  largest known U.S. data set on trafficking. Polaris uses  that data to understand and improve the way trafficking  is identified, how victims and survivors are assisted, and  how to prevent this abuse. Responsible Labor Initiative: The Responsible Labor  Initiative is a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder initiative  focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable  to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently  respected and promoted. StolenYouth:  partners with StolenYouth, a  Seattle-based organization with the mission to end  child sex trafficking in the state of Washington through  prevention, connecting trafficked youth to resources  and services, and empowering survivors along their  path to recovery and a promising future. We support  StolenYouth by providing both financial support and  goods donations. Tech Against Trafficking: Tech Against Trafficking (TAT) is  a coalition of companies collaborating with global experts  to help eradicate human trafficking using technology. sits on the TAT steering committee and has  leveraged the expertise and resources of AWS to help scale  tech solutions in the anti-trafficking field. Truckers Against Trafficking: We are an official  corporate sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), an  organization dedicated to combating human trafficking in  the trucking industry, and began incorporating TAT training  modules into trainings for our internal fleet of drivers  to teach them how to identify and respond to potential  victims of human trafficking. As of January 2021, we have  trained 100% of  employees who drive trucks. Thorn: Thorn, an organization that builds technology to  defend children from sexual abuse, leverages AWS machine  learning tools in their product Spotlight. Spotlight’s  sophisticated machine learning capabilities save time  for investigators by automatically flagging ads likely to  represent at-risk children. Investigators can set customized  alerts and search Spotlight’s constantly growing database  of ads to aid in their investigations. Spotlight has helped  identify more than 17,000 child sex trafficking victims. Unseen: We support the UK modern slavery helpline  Unseen, investing in their efforts to provide immediate and  long-term assistance to potential victims of modern slavery  and to ensure the helpline’s continued growth. The helpline  provides direct response and services to potential victims  of modern slavery, as well as trainings and programming to  support victims. Gender equity is a fundamental human right and a  necessary foundation to a truly sustainable supply chain. Quality jobs for women translate to positive impacts for  communities, and we are actively working to empower  women to make their own decisions on health, finances,  and career development. partners with BSR’s  HERproject, an initiative that brings together global brands,  their suppliers, and local partners to create and implement  workplace-based interventions on health, financial  inclusion, and gender equality. Through our partnership  with HERproject, we engage suppliers in China, Bangladesh,  Vietnam, and India. As of 2021, we have reached nearly  12,000 women with HERproject programming, including  training on health and financial skills, and building the  capacity of workers and factory management to combat  gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Fair Wages  
We are committed to working closely with suppliers,  business partners, and multi-stakeholder associations to  monitor and promote continuous improvement in working  conditions, including fair and on-time payment of wages. We have dedicated teams across the globe that work  directly with suppliers to track and report performance  against these standards. Our suppliers are required to pay legally required  compensation (including overtime and benefits) and we  encourage them to continuously evaluate whether their  workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and the  needs of their families. We require -branded suppliers in a number of  regions to enroll in Better Work—a partnership between  the International Labor Organization and the International  Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group,  focused on improving working conditions, respect for  labor rights, and making the global garment sector more  competitive. By working with factories and training workers  on their rights, Better Work supports greater compliance  with national labor laws and international labor standards. We are launching in-depth research into fair wages within  our -branded products supply chains, with a 2021  goal of identifying opportunities for future programming. Our aim is to ensure that the manufacturing of our products  does not cause unnecessary environmental harm. We are a  member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (Coalition), an  industry-wide group of leading apparel and footwear brands,  retailers, manufacturers, non-governmental organizations,  academic experts, and government organizations working  to reduce the environmental and social impacts of apparel  products around the world. We encourage our - branded suppliers to evaluate their practices using the  Coalition’s Higg Index, a tool to help manufacturers measure  the social and environmental performance of their facilities. We are committed to driving adoption of this assessment  and helping our suppliers understand their environmental  impacts. In 2021,  established a goal to collect  environmental performance data from 200 suppliers by the  end of the year. At , we are focused on leveraging our scale and  assets for good to strengthen communities where our  employees and customers live and work.

In January 2021,   launched the Housing Equity Fund, a commitment of  more than $2 billion to preserve and create more than  20,000 affordable homes in three communities where we  have a high concentration of employees: Washington’s  Puget Sound region; Washington, D.C., and Arlington,  Virginia, metropolitan areas; and Nashville, Tennessee. The Housing Equity Fund helps create inclusive housing  developments and preserve existing housing through  below-market loans and grants to non-traditional  and traditional housing partners, public agencies, and  minority-led organizations. Our first commitment  included more than $380 million in below-market loans  and grants to the Washington Housing Conservancy to  preserve and create up to 1,300 affordable homes in  Arlington, Virginia. has also committed more  than $185 million in below-market loans and grants to  King County Housing Authority to preserve up to 1,000  affordable homes in the Puget Sound area. made additional donations in support of  affordable housing in 2020. We donated $3 million to  four legal service providers to help support families  in need of pro-bono legal housing support in the  Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia, metropolitan  areas. We also helped preserve home ownership for  hundreds of residents in Nashville, Tennessee, with a  $2.25 million donation to The Housing Fund. With this  donation, The Housing Fund will make financial grants  available to help ensure that families can keep their  homes and maintain critical, long-term financial stability. has also committed more than $130 million  to our nonprofit partners who are working to fight  homelessness. In 2020, we opened the doors to a  
permanent eight-floor shelter inside an  office  building at our Puget Sound headquarters in partnership  with Mary’s Place, a Seattle-based provider serving  families experiencing homelessness. The shelter is the  largest family shelter in the state of Washington, with  space for 200 guests each night. The facility features  an on-site health clinic, an industrial kitchen with the  capacity to produce approximately 600,000 meals  annually, recreation areas for children of all ages to play,  and dedicated space for in-person and virtual pro bono  legal support, resume reviews, and online learning. ’s donation will  help us keep more families  in their homes, which is  always our ultimate goal,  because home ownership  is the key to long-term  wealth building. For these  families, these grants will  be game-changing.  believes that no family should go without a way  to address their basic needs. In 2020,  made  in-kind and cash donations equivalent to more than 20  million meals and 13 million essential items to nonprofits,  food banks, and strategic partners. We also committed  a total of $6.2 million through our Right Now Needs  Fund, a flexible fund designed to meet the basic needs  of schoolchildren and help eliminate barriers to learning. These funds have already provided support to more  than 28,000 students with food, shelter, clothing, school  supplies, and hygiene items in the states of Washington  and Virginia. In 2020, more than 26,000  operations employees and  delivery partners identified needs in communities where they  live and work, and  donated $7.9 million to meet these  community needs, benefiting 260 nonprofit organizations and 1.6  million community members globally in Central Eastern Europe,  Italy, France, and the UK. Employees of our operations centers  and delivery stations also delivered meals and essential supplies;  hosted food, clothing, and school-supply drives; and organized  more than 1,000 events to support local community needs. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,  has  helped customers, provided community relief, and invested  in cutting-edge research.

To support food banks and  community organizations, we donated delivery services  of groceries and pre-packaged meals using our network  of  Flex Delivery and Delivery Service Partners. We delivered more than 12 million meals to seniors,  underserved families, and school children in communities  across the U.S., the UK, Australia, Singapore, and Spain. also delivered thousands of laptops and wireless  devices on behalf of school districts to low-income  students in order to support distance learning. Expanding Access for Vaccines  
 is leveraging our scale to get vaccines to people  in need. We lent our support to the Biden administration  in its effort to vaccinate 100 million people in the first 100  days of Biden’s presidency, vaccinating thousands of people  through pop-up clinics at  facilities in Washington,  Virginia, and Florida. We also developed a Pop-Up Vaccine  Clinic Playbook to help other companies and organizations  execute similar vaccination clinics. In 2020,  launched the Neighborhood Small  Business Relief Fund to provide cash grants and free rent to  Seattle small businesses that needed assistance. Through  this fund,  disbursed $11 million in relief to more  than 900 small businesses, supporting local jobs and  helping small businesses confront the economic challenges  of the COVID-19 pandemic. AWS is providing highly scalable and reliable  infrastructure capacity, technical support, and services  to help customers with their research, remote work and  learning, and other solutions to address their needs and  the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on  communities and businesses. AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative 
In 2020, we launched the AWS Diagnostic Development  Initiative to accelerate COVID-19 research. The initiative  supports AWS customers working on diagnostic solutions  and improving collaboration across organizations solving  similar problems. As part of this,  committed an  initial investment of $20 million to accelerate diagnostic  research, innovation, and development to speed our  collective understanding and detection of COVID-19. COVID-19 “Infodemic” Knowledge Platform 
A new project led by Imperial College London and enabled  by AWS is responding to the COVID-19 “infodemic” with  
the creation of a global knowledge platform. The platform,  known as Realtime Data Analysis and Synthesis (REDASA),  pools global data on COVID-19 from over half a million  sources and combines human curation with AWS machine  learning services to perform deep data analysis. This helps  the healthcare community find important insights in real  time, make sense of the vast amounts of information  pouring in, and develop plans to accelerate research and  development. Helping Migrants Stay Safe During the Pandemic 
AWS is supplying the International Organization for  Migration (IOM) with advanced cloud technologies and  technical expertise to accelerate its efforts to help migrants  around the world stay safe during the COVID-19 crisis. We  are developing a machine learning tool to help the IOM  collect and analyze high volumes of COVID-19-related  content from around the globe and to provide up-to-date  information on border and travel restrictions. We are also  helping the IOM proactively respond to the increasing  volume of requests from migrants for information and  help, enhancing a new website by integrating it with a  multi-lingual cloud call center and chatbot. The AWS InCommunities team develops innovative, long- term initiatives to foster lasting impact around the world,  specifically in communities where we build and operate  our global infrastructure. In 2020, AWS InCommunities  leveraged its global reach to better serve local  communities tackling the spread of COVID-19, including in  Umatilla, Oregon, where we worked to make sure residents  had access to basic needs. We collaborated with the  Umatilla Electric Cooperative (UEC) and Hermiston Energy  Services (HES) to support electricity relief for local residents  who had applied to a payment assistance program. We  
donated over half a million dollars to the communities  that UEC and HES serve and helped pay utility bills for  more than 1,000 families. “The effectiveness and reach  of the payment assistance program will be amplified by  our collaboration with AWS,” said Lisa McMeen, UEC’s VP  of Administration. “With such uncertainty and hardship  caused by the pandemic, it is great to work with trusted  partners like AWS to keep our community operating at  this time.” We also worked with our partners in the region  to provide meals, distance learning kits, laptops, and Wi-Fi  connectivity for school children and senior citizens. ’s disaster relief and response teams leverage our  vast operational excellence, cloud computing technologies,  and worldwide logistics network to provide fast and  effective support to worldwide operations addressing  large-scale natural disasters. These strengths enable  us to ship -donated items and items donated  by partners to communities as soon as possible after  hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, and earthquakes. Over the years,  has enabled customers to easily  donate products and cash through our online store, and  helped governments and nonprofits expedite response  efforts at scale through our AWS cloud services. We  recognize the immense need to support communities  during and after natural disasters. We work with  organizations based on need and where we believe we can  have the greatest impact, with the goal of strengthening  communities. In 2020, we supported the response to 16  natural disasters in 12 countries and partnered with 53  nonprofit service providers to enable critical support for  front-line responders and survivors. Together with   customers, we donated more than $22 million in products  and cash to support people impacted by natural disasters  around the world and first responders fighting those  disasters. Donations included more than 12 million relief  items, such as masks, bottled water, hygiene products,  baby supplies, food, and other essential items. ” 
’s... willingness to  donate and pre-position  personal protective  equipment and relief  supplies means that  our team will have the  resources it needs to  respond and support  families and communities  when they need it most. At , we believe in the power of computer science  to unleash creativity and unlock human potential. We  also know that while talent and passion are spread across  all young people, opportunity is not.

AWS Cloud Computing Training 
In December 2020,  announced a pledge to help  29 million people around the world grow their tech skills  with free cloud computing skills training by 2025. To get  to 29 million, we are expanding existing AWS-designed  programs and piloting new ones to meet emerging training  needs. These programs emphasize cloud computing  training as the need for people with the right skills to take  on cloud computing and other technical roles continues to  grow. That need has become more apparent over the last  year as schools, businesses, and governments have relied  on the cloud to keep their organizations running. Whole Foods Market was founded with a purpose: to  nourish people and the planet. Whole Foods Market  community giving programs provide a wide range of  resources to help address existing and emerging needs in  our neighborhoods and industry. We work with individuals  and organizations that share our values, and proudly  support hundreds of partnerships and initiatives each year. Whole Foods Market Foundations 
Whole Foods Market has established three foundations to  support strategic programs that make an impact across the  globe. Whole Planet Foundation is committed to alleviating  global poverty for people living in communities in the U.S.  and around the world that supply our stores with products. Whole Kids Foundation supports schools and inspires families  to improve children’s nutrition and wellness. Whole Cities  Foundation expands healthy food access and nutrition  education by partnering with community-led organizations  to build thriving local food systems. Through these three  foundations, Whole Foods Market has committed more than  $50 million to local and global communities since 2005. Sourced for Good 
Whole Foods Market is committed to strengthening the  communities where products are sourced. Our Sourced  for Good program supports workers, communities, and  the environment by enabling tangible improvements in  farmworkers’ lives through improved wages, access to  healthcare, student scholarships, and more. Through the  Sourced for Good program, Whole Foods Market has  generated $40 million in development funds for farmworkers  and their communities from the sale of fair-trade-certified  produce and floral products, benefiting more than 67,000  workers and small producers in 12 countries around the world. Whole Foods Market provides loans to small, local,  independent producers to help them expand their  businesses through the Local Producer Loan Program. Loan recipients have included organic vegetable farmers,  a heritage turkey grower, a nutritional protein bar maker,  a maker of body care products, and many others. The  Local Producer Loan Program has provided more than 350  loans, representing $25 million in capital, to our suppliers  in support of the development of specific products that we  want to carry in our Whole Foods Market stores. At , we take a science-based, customer-centric  approach to sustainability. We use a structured life-cycle  assessment model to measure and map climate-related  risks across our value chain. We also conduct regular  materiality assessments to understand the most significant  environmental, social, and governance topics across our  business over the short, medium, and long term. We  monitor risks and prioritize opportunities by taking into  account customer and stakeholder expectations, voluntary  practices and regulations, industry best practices, trends in  financial and sustainability reporting, and emerging topics  in news and social media. Some of our current highest priority sustainability issues are: 
Responsible employment and supply chain  practices, including human rights and the safety  and well-being of workers in our supply chain 
  While our positions are carefully considered and deeply  held, there is much room for healthy debate and differing  opinions. We hope being clear about our positions is helpful. ’s Board of Directors oversee executives’  management of ’s relevant risks and regularly  reviews reports from management on various aspects  of our business, including related risks and tactics and  strategies for addressing them. While the full Board has  overall responsibility for risk oversight, the Board has  delegated responsibility related to certain risks to the  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the  Leadership Development and Compensation Committee,  and the Audit Committee. Risk Oversight 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  is responsible for overseeing management of risks  related to our environmental, sustainability, and  corporate social responsibility practices, including risks  related to our operations and our supply chain. The  Leadership Development and Compensation Committee  is responsible for overseeing management of risks  related to succession planning and compensation for  our executive officers and our overall compensation  program, including our equity-based compensation  plans, as well as risks related to other human capital  management matters, including workplace safety,  culture, diversity, discrimination, and harassment. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing  management of risks related to our financial statements  and financial reporting process, data privacy and  security, business continuity, and operational risks, the  qualifications, independence, and performance of our  independent auditors, the performance of our internal  audit function, legal and regulatory matters, and our  compliance policies and procedures. During the past year, the Nominating and Corporate  Governance Committee met with management and reviewed  matters that included the Board’s composition, diversity, and  skills in the context of identifying and evaluating new director  candidates to join the Board, the Board’s recruitment and  self-evaluation processes, consideration of ’s policies  and initiatives regarding the environment and sustainability,  corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance, and  feedback from ’s shareholder engagement on the  foregoing matters. During the past year, the Leadership Development and  Compensation Committee met with management and  reviewed matters that included the design, amounts,  and effectiveness of ’s compensation of  senior executives, management succession planning,  our benefit and compensation programs, our human  resources programs, including review of certain workplace  discrimination and harassment reports, worker safety and  workplace conditions, and feedback from shareholder  engagement. Workplace safety and our response to  the COVID-19 pandemic have been significant topics  of discussion and oversight at those meetings since the  onset of the pandemic. In addition, the Committee, as  well as the full Board, reviewed ’s response to  the COVID-19 pandemic and our actions to address and  mitigate the pandemic’s impact on employees in regularly  scheduled calls throughout 2020, reflecting the fact  that the COVID-19 pandemic was significant to so many  aspects of our operations that the updates should be  provided to the entire Board. During the past year, the Audit Committee met with  management and reviewed matters that included  ’s risk assessment and compliance functions, data  privacy and security, public policy expenditures, treasury  and investment matters, accounting industry issues, the  reappointment of our independent auditor, and pending  litigation. The Audit Committee annually reviews ’s  U.S. Political Engagement Policy and Statement and  a report on our public policy expenditures. The Audit  Committee also met with the auditors to review the scope  and results of the auditor’s annual audit and quarterly  reviews of ’s financial statements. We believe that effective corporate governance includes  year-round engagement with our shareholders and other  stakeholders. We meet regularly with our shareholders,  including both large and small investors, to discuss  business strategy, performance, compensation philosophy,  
corporate governance, and environmental and social  topics. In a typical year, we will engage with dozens of  shareholders, including our largest shareholders, two to  three times per year. This outreach is complementary to  the hundreds of touchpoints our Investor Relations team  has with shareholders each year. We find it beneficial to  have ongoing dialogue with our shareholders throughout  the year on a full range of investor priorities (instead  of engaging with shareholders only prior to our annual  meeting on issues to be voted on in the proxy statement). Depending on the circumstance, our lead director or  another independent director may engage in these  conversations with shareholders as well. In 2020, as part of our corporate governance engagement,  we met with corporate governance representatives at  shareholders owning over 35% of our stock (excluding the  approximately 14% voted by our founder and  Executive  Chair) and responded to numerous letters from our  investors. Our direct engagement with shareholders helps  us better understand our shareholders’ priorities,  perspectives, and issues of concern, while giving us an  opportunity to elaborate on our many initiatives and  practices and to address the extent to which various  aspects of these matters are (or are not) significant given  the scope and nature of our operations and our existing  practices. We take insights from this feedback into  consideration and regularly share them with our Board as  we review and evolve our practices and disclosures. Increasing the deployment of renewable energy  resources, clean transportation options, and other low- carbon technologies is valuable for the planet, good for  business, and important for our customers.

We share our supplier assessment data to demonstrate  our commitment to transparency and contribute to  industry-wide knowledge on complex and changing  supply chain conditions. In 2020, we conducted 4,708  assessments to help us determine which suppliers to work  with and, for those we do engage, to help us continually  understand and improve those suppliers’ practices. We  utilize three types of assessments: 
 Pre-Production Assessments: Suppliers must submit  an -approved assessment of their facilities  before beginning production of -branded  products (44% of assessments conducted in 2020  were Pre-Production Assessments). Ongoing Assessments: Suppliers must submit  -approved assessments on an ongoing  basis while producing  products (36% of  assessments conducted in 2020 were Ongoing  Assessments). Verification Assessments: Where issues are  identified, suppliers must develop a corrective action  plan detailing actions to address identified issues, a  long-term plan to prevent reoccurrence, and where  necessary, undergo a follow-up assessment to ensure  issues are properly remediated (20% of assessments  conducted in 2020 were Verification Assessments). Our assessment data reflects findings for suppliers  evaluated in 2019 and 2020 and includes assessments of  suppliers we no longer work with or with which we never  began a business relationship. Assessments may have  found more than one issue listed. We accept assessments  completed by qualified independent audit firms based  on our own assessment standards and those of industry  associations, including Sedex (SMETA), amfori (amfori  BSCI), and the Responsible Business Alliance; certification  standard Social Accountability International (SA8000); and  the Better Work program. Our assessment data helps us determine where to focus  our efforts and resources, and provides insight into  industry-wide challenges and systemic issues. For example,  in 2020, we saw increased rates of findings in some  categories primarily driven by pre-production audits (e.g.,  Freely Chosen Employment). We worked with suppliers  to remediate these issues before going into production  and did not see similarly high rates in verification audits. Increased findings with other issues (e.g., Industrial  Hygiene) were driven by a need for supplier education  where our standards exceed local law and industry practice. In other cases, the increased rate of findings in specific  categories (e.g., Wages and Benefits) represents industry- wide challenges which require industry-level, long-term  solutions. We recognize that we cannot address many  of these systemic issues alone and we are committed to  engaging in industry-level interventions in order to drive  improvement in working conditions. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 global goals the United Nations  General Assembly (UN) set to provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the  planet, now and into the future. At , there are multiple ways our sustainability work aligns  with these global goals. The following shows how our programs correspond to the UN SDGs: The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board is an independent standards board that is accountable for the due process, outcomes, and ratification of the SASB standards,  
which seek to identify financially material sustainability information. The table below lists topics classified as applicable to the E-Commerce Industry.

We rolled out the first of these vehicles in Los Angeles in February 2021 and will  expand to neighborhoods in up to 15 additional U.S. cities by the end of the year. We also expanded  our European electric delivery fleet with an order for 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz, a  signatory of The Climate Pledge. In India, we are adding 10,000 electric vehicles to our existing  fleet by 2025, including two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler vehicles designed and  manufactured by local manufacturers. In addition to our investments in vehicle electrification, we  are maximizing efficiency on current vehicles, optimizing our delivery logistics, and using alternative  delivery methods. See Transportation on pages 32-34. As of June 2021, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by over 36% and eliminated  more than 1 million tons of packaging material since 2015—the equivalent of 2 billion shipping boxes. In 2019, we launched a fully recyclable paper padded mailer that protects products during shipping  while taking up less space in transit. We are also increasing our use of flexible paper-based mailers  across Europe, allowing us to significantly reduce the use of plastic in packaging materials by the end  of 2021. See Packaging on pages 45-46. We are making these significant investments to drive our carbon footprint to zero despite the fact  that shopping online is already inherently more carbon efficient than going to the store. ’s  sustainability scientists have found that, averaged across all basket sizes, online grocery deliveries  generate 43% lower carbon emissions per item compared to shopping in stores. Smaller basket sizes  generate even greater carbon savings. See 2019 Letter to Shareholders.

In India, we are adding 10,000 electric vehicles to our existing fleet  by 2025, including two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler vehicles designed and manufactured by local manufacturers. is working to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our buildings, from the carbon embodied in construction materials, to the  operational emissions from powering our activities. In 2020, we launched an in-depth study of our operations facilities to examine the energy  intensity of our buildings and identify ways to reduce carbon through energy efficiency enhancements, new technologies, and sustainable building  materials. We have started applying these insights across building types and are incorporating best practices into future building development plans. AWS has multiple initiatives underway to use water more efficiently and use less potable (drinking) water to cool our data centers. AWS develops  our water-use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local water management and availability, and the opportunity to  conserve drinking water sources. In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data center operator to be approved to use recycled water with direct  evaporative cooling technology.  customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. We work to reinvent and  simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science,  and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of  outbound packaging by 36% and eliminated more than 1 million tons of packaging material, the equivalent of about 2 billion shipping boxes. As part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, we are working to give our customers access to more sustainable products,  from thousands of -branded products we develop and manufacture, to millions of retail and third-party items sold in ’s store. We are committed to helping customers find products that exceed the social and environmental benefits of comparable options when they  shop in our stores, through programs such as Climate Pledge Friendly. We work with the suppliers of our branded products to drive sustainability  improvements across the stages of material sourcing, design, manufacturing, and customer use. is committed to reducing our environmental footprint through recycling initiatives in our own operations and partnerships that support  the development of recycling infrastructure across the industry. has on-site plastic film recycling at more than 168 fulfillment centers  across our network. We also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund to finance recycling and circular economy infrastructure  in North America. We also incorporate recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new  devices, giving new life to materials that  could have otherwise ended up in waste streams. The Climate Pledge Fund is a corporate venture capital fund that invests in companies that can accelerate ’s path to meeting The  Climate Pledge. launched The Climate Pledge Fund in 2020 to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies  and services. This dedicated investment program—with an initial $2 billion in funding—invests in visionary companies whose products and  solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The  Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time  required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets. ASDI works with scientific organizations like NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office, and  The Queensland Government to identify, host, and deploy key datasets on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations, weather forecasts,  climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. In 2020,  became a founding  member of the LF Climate Finance Foundation, a new initiative with the goal of empowering investors, banks, insurers, companies, governments,  NGOs, and academia with AI-enhanced open source analytics and open data to address climate risk and opportunity. Through this collaboration,  we are leveraging the AWS Cloud to make climate-relevant data available to the public. Our team of researchers and scientists has combined cutting-edge life cycle assessment (LCA) science and AWS technology to develop a robust software solution that processes  billions of operational and financial records from ’s operations across the world to calculate our carbon footprint. The software estimates carbon emissions for all activities  within our system boundary using a dollar-based environmental assessment model, then enhances the accuracy of carbon-intensive activities with detailed, process-based LCA  models. We have a comprehensive understanding of the carbon emissions across our business and have done extensive analysis to develop science-based targets, strategies, and  metrics to reduce them. Teams across  are taking a broad, science-based approach to measuring, reducing, and eliminating carbon emissions in our operations. As part of our commitment to  The Climate Pledge, we are proud to have joined the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), reaffirming our commitment to reduce carbon emissions in line with our ongoing  science-based approach to tackle climate change.
