Economic and Technological Development,"economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all  Roughly half the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of about US$2 a day. And in too many places, having a job doesn’t guarantee the ability to escape from poverty.  Substandard working conditions are often related to poverty, inequality and discrimination. In many contexts, certain groups – such as workers with disabilities, women workers, youth, and migrants, among others – face particular obstacles in accessing decent work and may be especially vulnerable to abuses.  Employment growth since 2008 has averaged only 0.1% annually, compared with 0.9% between 2000 and 2007  Over 60 per cent of all workers lack any kind of employment contract  Fewer than 45 per cent of wage and salaried workers are employed on a full-time, permanent basis, and even that share is declining.  By 2019, more than 212 million people will be out of work, up from the current 201 million  600 million new jobs need to be created by 2030, just to keep pace with the growth of the working age population  Businesses are engines for job creation and economic growth and foster economic activity through their value chain. Decent work opportunities are good for business and society. Companies that uphold labor standards across their own operations and value chains face lower risk of reputational damage and legal liability. Instituting non-discriminatory practices and embracing diversity and inclusion will also lead to greater access to skilled, productive talent.  Employment  Economic inclusion  Non-discrimination  Capacity Building  Availability of a skilled workforce  Elimination of forced or compulsory labor  Offer apprenticeship opportunities.   Foster entrepreneurial culture and invest in or mentor young entrepreneurs.  Initiate skills development programs moving down company supply chains.

By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the ILO Global Jobs Pact Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Aging, degraded or non-existent infrastructure makes conducting good business challenging. Business relies on materials, resources, labor and service support from all corners of the world and the ability to access them efficiently is key to establishing new markets. Computing and technology-based skills are of significant value to most businesses today, and consumers of common goods and services live on every continent. However, basic infrastructure supporting technologies, communications, transportation, and sanitation that business relies on is not universally available, hindering economic growth and societal progress.   This presents an opportunity for business. By committing to sustainable industrialization and promoting innovation across company operations, businesses can contribute to development efforts in the regions in which they operate through upgrading local infrastructure, investing in resilient energy and communications technologies, and making these technologies available to all people, including marginalized groups, who might not have access otherwise. Global companies can also promote inclusive infrastructure development by bringing valuable financial services and employment opportunities to smaller and/or minority-owned businesses.    Infrastructure investments  Access to financial services   Environmental investments  Research and development Technological legacies  Invest in new, resilient infrastructure in developing countries or retrofit existing infrastructure to make it more sustainable.   Expand the geographic reach of research and development facilities, bringing R&D capabilities to developing countries.  Promote innovation by giving all stakeholders the opportunity to offer creative solutions to sustainability challenges. Further scope out the good ideas and offer awards to the best.  Consult and engage a wide range of stakeholders, including minority groups, to ensure that infrastructure development benefits and creates opportunities for all.

Environments,"Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Climate change is caused by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. Climate change impacts natural and human systems globally through the increase globally averaged surface temperature, extreme weather events, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels and ocean acidification. These risks will ultimately impact people’s livelihoods, particularly marginalized groups such as women, children, and the elderly, as resources, food and water become more scarce. Those effects impact the other SDGs and often make it more difficult to achieve them. To achieve the UNFCCC goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world must transform its energy, industry, transport, food, agriculture and forestry systems to ensure that cumulative net emissions do not exceed one trillion tonnes of cumulative carbon, which implies global net zero emissions by the second half of the century.  Simultaneously the world needs to anticipate, adapt and become resilient to the current and expected future impacts of climate change.  Companies can contribute to this SDG by decarbonizing their operations and supply chains through continuously improving energy efficiency, reducing the carbon footprint of their products, services and processes, and setting ambitious emissions reductions targets in line with climate science, as well as scaling up investment in the development of innovative low-carbon products and services. In addition, companies should build resilience in their operations, supply chains and the communities in which they operate.  Energy efficiency   Environmental investments  GHG emissions   Risks and opportunities due to climate change  Source all electricity the company consumes at its facilities from renewable sources – such as wind, solar or hydro – or install renewable energy generation capacity on-site.  Retrofit the lighting systems of the company’s facilities to energy efficient LED lighting.  Increase investment in innovation to improve the efficiency of the company’s product portfolio, thereby enabling customers to reduce their GHG emissions.   Invest in CCS (carbon capture & storage) technology to capture emissions produced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and industrial processes, preventing the carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.  Reduce GHG emission from transport operations with abatement levers such as reducing the carbon footprint through greater fuel efficiency, local sourcing, modal shift to lower carbon modalities (e.g. air to sea freight), modular transport, improving container utilization, warehouse optimization, etc.    Understand climate risk and build resilience into the company’s assets and supply chain.   Expand sustainable forest management through responsible sourcing practices and product substitution.  Director greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1)  Energy indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 2)  Other indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 3)   Engagement in initiatives that promote resilient practices and/or upgrade value chain procedures in order to address climate change   The Greenhouse Gas Protocol   Impact Reporting & Investment Standards (IRIS) Building a Resilient in Power Sector   13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters in all countries  13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning  13.3 Improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning  13.a Implement the commitment undertaken by developed country Parties to the UNFCCC to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible 13.b Promote mechanisms for raising capacities for effective climate change-related planning and management, in LDCs, including focusing on women, youth, local and marginalized communities  Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss  Business and ecosystems are linked. Companies affect ecosystems because they rely on the provisioning services (e.g. freshwater, fiber, food) and regulatory services (e.g. climate regulation, flood control, water purification) ecosystems provide.  60% of the world’s ecosystem services have been degraded over the past 50 years and we continue devaluing our natural resources at an alarming rate. Estimates indicate that 2-5 trillion USD of ecosystem services are lost each year from deforestation alone. While many of the effects are felt locally first, the long-term consequences are global and the scale is highly relevant to business, presenting risks and opportunities.  To retain the integrity and vitality of natural resources today and for future generations and to ensure long-term socio-economic growth and prosperity, sustainable management of land is key. Business can directly contribute to this SDG by measuring, managing and mitigating its impact and dependence on land and ecosystems. Companies can implement strategies to incentivize sustainable land use, responsible forest management and environmental stewardship. To secure supply of natural resources and raw material in the future, companies will also have to increase efforts to restore degraded land. By scaling up research and development in innovation, investing in natural infrastructure and implementing responsible sourcing policies, companies play an integral part in preserving and restoring vital ecosystems, promoting the sustainable use of land and forests, while retaining consumer confidence in their product offerings.   Deforestation and forest degradation  Genetic diversity of farms and domesticated animals   Land remediation   Landscapes forest management and fiber sourcing   Mountain ecosystems   Natural habit degradation   Terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems   Measure, manage and mitigate impacts on ecosystems and natural resources.   Scale up best practices for land use planning and management.  Invest in natural infrastructure as a cost-competitive alternative to grey infrastructure.   Finance the restoration of degraded land for production and/or conservation purposes.  Support and apply landscape approaches, based on multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaborative action, to overcome social and environmental fracture lines in landscapes facing deforestation, land and ecosystem degradation.  Commit to and implement responsible sourcing practices beyond compliance - applying environmental and social safeguards - for all raw materials and commodities.   Expand markets for responsible forest products and thereby support sustainable forest management.   Foster product and technology innovation to optimize resource efficiency, reduce impacts on ecosystems and lower carbon emissions.  Scale up industrial reuse of water and support watershed protection programs.  Habitats protected or restored  Commitment to reduce or remove deforestation and forest degradation from direct operations and/or supply chain  % of total volume of wood/fiber/products intake certified    Description of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas  •  Eco4Biz  Sustainable Procurement Guide for Wood and Paper-based Products  WBCSD Global Water Tool  Guide to Investing in Locally Controlled Forestry  15.1 By 2020, ensure conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements  15.2 By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and increase afforestation and reforestation by x% globally  15.3 By 2020, combat desertification, and restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world  15.4 By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, to enhance their capacity to provide benefits which are essential for sustainable development  15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce degradation of natural habitat, halt the loss of biodiversity, and by 2020 protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species  15.6 Ensure fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, and promote appropriate access to genetic resources  15.7 Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna, and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products  15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems, and control or eradicate the priority species  15.9 By 2020, integrate ecosystems and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes and poverty reduction strategies, and accounts  15.a Mobilize and significantly increase from all sources financial resources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems 15.b Mobilize significantly resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management, and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance sustainable forest management, including for conservation and reforestation  15.c Enhance global support to efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities "
Equity,"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all  Education is a fundamental human right and is indispensable for the achievement of sustainable development. We are only able to empower girls, combat climate change, fight inequality and end extreme poverty if all stakeholders, including business, commit themselves to advancing the education goal. While education needs globally are immense, companies can leverage their resources and core competencies to support governments in delivering on their promise of education for all. Strong leadership by business can help unlock the necessary investments to ensure quality learning opportunities for all children and adults.   The business case to invest in education can range from improving brand leadership to developing the capacity of future employees and building a more diverse employee pipeline. Education can help address the mismatch between skills of the available workforce and job vacancies, which is a key problem in many markets. Business can make long-term strategic investments in education that will lead to a larger, more talented pool of future employees. Investing in education can be a source of innovation and facilitate access to new markets.   Education is often a local issue, which will require businesses to work within local education systems and in communities to determine the best utilization of resources. Business should apply best practices to engage responsibly in education, including promoting sustainable development topics in higher education, and support the public sector’s ability to provide inclusive and equitable quality learning opportunities for all.    Education for sustainable development  Availability of a skilled workforce  Capacity Building  Indirect Impact on Job Creation   Youth Employment  Establish relationships with government entities and higher education institutions to improve education curricula to better align with business needs including responsible management.   Create programs (e.g., internships, work-study programs, traineeships, etc.) that give students earlier access to the corporate environment.  Provide employees with continuous opportunities to improve their (job) skills for their current and future employment.  Develop cost-effective education products and services that eliminate barriers to access and improve the quality of learning (e.g., ICT solutions to improve the delivery of education, innovative measurement tools, etc.).  Ensure learning environments are clean and safe for children by mitigating business-related environmental hazards, like pollution and limited water access.  The Women’s Empowerment Principles: What is the business’ policy and provision of childcare facilities and how many employees, if any, use this facility?  Type and number of sustainability certification, rating and labeling schemes for new construction, management, occupation and redevelopment  i) Approximate proportion of workers (m/w) along the value chain who receive training per year. ii) Average number of hours (or days) of training(s) provided to workers (m/w). iii) Provide details on the type(s) of training(s) provided  Average hours of training per year per employee by gender, and by employee category  Report the measures taken to develop and enhance the highest  vernance body’s collective knowledge of economic, environmental and social topics  Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB)  Impact Reporting & Investment Standards (IRIS)  UN Global Compact- Oxfam Poverty Footprint   4.1 By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes  4.2 By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education  4.3 By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university  4.4 By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship  4.5 By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, and children in vulnerable situations  4.6 By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and men, achieve literacy and numeracy  4.7 By 2030, ensure all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultures contribution to sustainable development  4.a Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all  4.b By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships for developing countries in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training, and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programs in developed countries and other developing countries 4.c By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries, small island developing States  Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Gender equality is a fundamental and inviolable human right and women’s and girls’ empowerment is essential to expand economic growth, promote social development and enhance business performance. The full incorporation of women’s capacities into labor forces would add percentage points to most national growth rates – double digits in many cases. Further, investing in women’s empowerment produces the double dividend of benefiting women and children, and is pivotal to the health and social development of families, communities and nations.  Empowering women and girls and achieving gender equality requires the concerted efforts of all stakeholders, including business. All companies have baseline responsibilities to respect human rights, including the rights of women and girls. Beyond these baseline responsibilities, companies also have the opportunity to support the empowerment of women and girls through core business, social investment, public policy engagement and partnerships. As the engine for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, technological innovation, capital creation and investment, responsible business is critical to the advancement of women’s and girls’ empowerment around the world. With a growing business case, private sector leaders are increasingly developing and adapting policies and practices, and implementing cutting edge initiatives, to advance women’s empowerment within their workplaces, marketplaces and communities. The launch of the SDGs in September provides a tremendous opportunity for companies to further align their strategies and operations with global priorities by mainstreaming gender equality into all areas of corporate sustainability and systematically and strategically scaling up actions which support the development and livelihoods of women and girls.   Equal remuneration for women and men  Diversity and equal opportunity  Access to sexual and reproductive health-care services  Workplace violence and harassment  Women in leadership  Childcare services and benefits  Assure sufficient participation of women – 30% or greater – in decision-making and governance at all levels and across all business areas.  Pay equal remuneration, including benefits, for work of equal value and strive to pay a living wage to all women and men.  Support access to child and dependent care by providing services, resources and information to both women and men.  Establish a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of violence at work, including verbal/ and/ or physical abuse and prevent sexual harassment.   Expand business relationships with women-owned enterprises, including small businesses and women entrepreneurs.  What is the business’ policy on maternity, paternity and family leave length and entitlements and to what extent does this go above the statutory provisions in the regulatory regime where the business is operating? Do these policies apply throughout the operations in each country? Are sex-disaggregated statistics kept and tracked?  Does the business have an explicit, well-publicized policy of zero tolerance towards gender-based violence and harassment? Is there a confidential complaint procedure?   Total number and rates of new employee hires and employee turnover by age group, gender, and region  Composition of governance bodies and breakdown of employees per employee category according to gender, age group, minority group membership, and other indicators of diversity  Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men by employee category, by significant locations of operation  Describe policies and practices used to promote economic inclusion when selecting suppliers. Forms of economic inclusion may include: suppliers owned by women; suppliers owned or staffed by members of vulnerable, marginalized or underrepresented social groups; and small and medium sized suppliers  Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB)  Gender Equality Principles self-assessment  Impact Reporting & Investment Standards (IRIS)  Social Hotspots Database/ Portal (SHDB)  UN Global Compact- Oxfam Poverty Footprint  Understand and Measuring Women’s Economic Empowerment   5.1 End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere   5.2 Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation   5.3 Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilations   5.4 Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies, and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate   5.5 Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life   5.6 Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Program of  Action of the ICPD and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences   5.a. Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance, and natural resources in accordance with national laws  5.b. Enhance the use of enabling technologies, in particular ICT, to promote women’s empowerment  5.c. Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels  Reduce inequality within and among countries Inequalities in income and wealth are severe and have been widening globally. The richest 1% of the world’s population now control up to 40% of global assets, while the poorest half owns just one per cent. Income equality between countries is higher than that within a large majority of countries, such that individual incomes are still largely associated with a person’s citizenship and location. Wide and often mutually reinforcing disparities are also evident within countries, including disparity in terms of: rural/urban disparities, household wealth, gender, ethnic minorities and indigenous people, migrant status, and disability.    Businesses are engines for economic growth, having the potential to create jobs, foster economic activity through their value chain, and contribute tax revenues for public services and infrastructure. However, business can also exacerbate inequality, and its structural drivers, including by being complicit in perpetuating biases and discrimination. All businesses have the responsibility to respect human rights. This includes adopting and implementing policies on respect for human rights including worker’s rights (collective bargaining, decent work conditions, etc.). In supply chains, one area to pay particular attention to is when third parties, such as recruitment agencies, are used to source labor. Such activity may place migrant workers at risk of exploitation such as forced labor and human trafficking, including where recruitment fees are charged to workers and where identity documents are retained. Thus, in addition to addressing their own impacts, businesses should use leverage to try to address adverse impacts with which they may be involved through third parties such as suppliers. Such leverage can also be used to encourage changes in policies and practices that may exclude workers based on factors such as age, gender, religious beliefs, national origin, or ethnicity.   Companies should engage governments in a transparent and accountable way, and disclose payments to governments. Whether through public policy dialogue or tax revenue, relationships between companies and governments are increasingly recognized as having a significant impact on human rights, which may exacerbate or improve inequality outcomes.    In addition to avoiding contributing to inequality, companies can also have a positive impact on addressing inequality through inclusive business models that provide empowerment for marginalized groups in the workplace, marketplace and community.  Availability of products and services for those on low incomes  Access to financial services  Equal remuneration for women and men  Capacity Building  Diversity and equal opportunity  Economic inclusion  Develop products and services tailored for poor customers (e.g. mobile based money transfer services for unbanked consumers).   Improve access to basic goods and services for people living in poverty (e.g. through core business, policy dialogue, social investment).  Recruit, train and employ local community members, including those living in poverty, and integrate them in your value chain (as producers, suppliers, distributors, vendors).  Invest in business-driven poverty eradication activities (e.g. develop living wage policy).  Partner with civil society networks to provide education and entrepreneurial skills training.  Does the Company system have policies/programs promoting equal opportunities (regardless of gender and other diversities) that explicitly extends to the entire value chain?  Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men by employee category, by significant locations of operation  Significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of impacts   Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men by employee category, by significant locations of operation   Percent of women clients accessing two or more distinct types of voluntary financial products  UN Global Compact-Oxfam Poverty Footprint Tool  Progress out of Poverty Index  Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB)   10.1 By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average  10.2 By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status  10.3 Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including through eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and actions in this regard  10.4 Adopt policies especially fiscal, wage, and social protection policies and progressively achieve greater equality  10.5 Improve regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and strengthen implementation of such regulations 10.6 Ensure enhanced representation and voice of developing countries in decision making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions  10.7 Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies  10.a. Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with WTO agreements  10.b. Encourage ODA and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to states where the need is greatest, in particular LDCs,  African countries, SIDS, and LLDCs, in accordance with their national plans and programs  10.c. By 2030, reduce to less than 3% the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5%"
Life,"End poverty in all its forms everywhere Despite progress under the MDGs, approximately 17% of the world’s population – more than 1 billion people – still lives at or below $1.25 per day. Over the past decade, markets in developing countries have expanded dramatically, and the volume of funds flowing from the private sector to these countries now dwarfs that of foreign aid, making the private sector one of the most significant influencers of global poverty.   Certain groups are disproportionately represented among the poor, and face additional constraints – such as limited access to productive resources and markets – in escaping poverty. These include women, persons with disabilities, children, and indigenous peoples.  Businesses should ensure that they meet their responsibility to respect human rights, including the rights of these groups. Businesses also have the opportunity to proactively take measures to address constraints faced by these groups, such as through inclusive business models, innovative products and/or services that better meet the needs of such groups, and by leveraging the unique perspectives of these groups as consumers, employees, suppliers and distributors in the value-chain, and community-members.  Beyond income, business can influence other dimensions of poverty, such as limited opportunities and capabilities. These inter-linked dimensions include food/nutrition insecurity, lack of access to basic, quality services such as health care, education and sanitation, and low empowerment and personal security. Several of these dimensions, especially for the poor, are closely related to the environment – for example health is directly affected by declining environmental quality in ways that the poor may find harder to address individually. These multiple dimensions of poverty – when suitably measured – convey a more complete picture than provided by the income indicator alone. Business’ role in poverty eradication also should address framework conditions of poverty, for example, by engaging in policy dialogue for the provision of basic goods and services where they operate.  Availability of products and services for those on low incomes  Earning, wages and benefits  Economic development in areas of high priority  Access to quality essential health care services  Access to WASH  Electricity availability and reliability  Non-discrimination  The below examples are non-exhaustive and some may be more relevant to certain industries than to others.  Develop products and services tailored for poor customers (e.g. mobile based money transfer services for unbanked consumers).   Improve access to basic goods and services for people living in poverty (e.g. through core business, policy dialogue, social investment).  Recruit, train and employ local community members, including those living in poverty, and integrate them in your value chain (as producers, suppliers, distributors, vendors).  Invest in business-driven poverty eradication activities (e.g. develop living wage policy).  Partner with civil society networks to provide education and entrepreneurial skills training.  Average wage of workers (disaggregate data by gender, type of contract, e.g., permanent, contractual or piece-rate, and report difference between low and high season for temporary workers)  Do major employers along the value chain and the wider company system negotiate wage and benefits standards through collective agreement?   Report the measures taken to develop and enhance the highest governance body’s collective knowledge of economic, environmental and social topics  Describe policies and practices used to promote economic inclusion when selecting suppliers  Does the company take into consideration needs-based affordability when making pricing decisions for relevant products targeted at the poorest population segments in relevant countries?  UN Global Compact-Oxfam Poverty Footprint Tool   UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework  Women’s Empowerment Principles  Inclusive business primer  1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day  1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions  1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable  1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance   1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climaterelated extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters  1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions  1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Food and agriculture are at the heart of civilization and prosperity. Yet, agriculture faces multiple challenges: a world population expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, smaller rural labor force, soil quality degradation, climate change, food wastage, water scarcity, biofuel production and changing lifestyles leading to urbanization and more protein-intensive diets. Furthermore, agricultural productivity increases would ensure food security for everyone only if access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food is secured. The growing pressure on global food systems constitutes a critical development challenge and creates an increasing risk for businesses, governments, communities and the environment. In this context, business has become a critical partner for governments and other stakeholders to design and deliver effective, scalable and practical solutions for secure and sustainable food and agriculture system.   Business can contribute to solving these challenges, eradicating hunger and improving food and agriculture systems. Implementing sustainable practices and working in partnership with other actors throughout the agricultural value chain (including input, production, distribution and retail) will be key to the implementation of SDG2. In particular, empowering small farmers, increasing agricultural productivity and farmers’ livelihoods, rising  consumers’ awareness and increasing agricultural investment as well as knowledge sharing will be necessary elements of better functioning food and agriculture systems.    Healthy and affordable food  Food labeling, safety and prices  Sustainable sourcing  Genetic diversity of farmed and domesticated animals Labor practices in the supply chain  Supporting, encouraging and demonstrating the continued viability of small scale farming, sustaining grower communities by developing partnerships with cooperatives and producer organizations supporting many small farmers.

Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives, and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility  Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Health is a fundamental human right and a key indicator of sustainable development. Poor health threatens the rights of children to education, limits economic opportunities for men and women and increases poverty within communities and countries around the world. In addition to being a cause of poverty, health is impacted by poverty and strongly connected to other aspects of sustainable development, including water and sanitation, gender equality, climate change and peace and stability.  In recent years, notable progress has been made, but significant challenges remain. Women around the world continue to lack access to sexual and reproductive health care; thousands of new cases of HIV/AIDS continue to occur each day, billions of people are left without access to essential medicines, millions of adults and children will suffer from undernourishment this year, and the global amount of waste is estimated to triple in the coming year, with severe effects on health  Further, with an increase in economic integration, mobility and political instability new health challenges and risks are emerging, threatening livelihoods in both the global North and South.    In order to accelerate progress and address new health challenges, all actors, including the private sector need to partner to develop health care solutions that work for people, families, communities and nations. At minimum business has a responsibility to respect all human rights, including the right to health. Small, medium and large companies can both benefit from and contribute to achieving healthy societies. The SDGs provide a new opportunity for the private sector to support the delivery of health needs around the world through their products, services and business activities including value chains and distribution networks, communication activities, occupational health and safety practices and provision of employee benefits. By ensuring that workers have safe working conditions and access to health services, companies establish healthier staff and better relationships which in many cases has positive effects on productivity.  Occupational health and safety  Access to medicines  Access to quality essential health care services  Air quality  Water quality  Align human resources policies with principles of human rights, including policies for HIV/AIDS. Use already existing resources for guidance (e.g. from the ILO, WHO, etc.).     Partner with health care NGOs and public clinics to raise awareness and increase access to targeted health services for women and men workers and their families.   Make investments in health a priority in business operations.  Facilitate and invest in affordable medicine and health care for low-income populations.

Resources,"Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Access to water and sanitation are basic human rights and are critical sustainable development challenges. These challenges will only worsen and the impacts on people will only increase as competing demands for clean fresh water (agriculture, households, energy generation, industrial use, ecosystems) are exacerbated by the effects of climate change putting more pressure on water quality and availability. These conditions will create increasing risk for businesses, governments, communities and the environment.  Business can contribute to the alleviation of these water challenges by adopting a water stewardship strategy that addresses the economic, environment, and social dimensions of water. By adopting stewardship, companies are able to make a positive contribution to improved water and sanitation management and governance that addresses their risks while contributing to sustainable development. This means adopting values and practices that aim to safeguard long-term availability of clean water and the provision of sanitation for all stakeholders in a watershed.   Sustainable water withdrawals  Improved water quality through effluent treatment  Improved water efficiency through application of 5R principles: reduce, reuse, recover, recycle, replenish  Equal, affordable, and safe, access to water access, sanitation, and hygiene for employees and communities  Protection of water-related ecosystems and biodiversity   Prioritize water efficiency across operations by installing best practice technologies for water conservation, in particular in water scarce areas.  Educating employees about the importance of water efficiency, including tying performance bonuses or operations-based incentives to efficient practices.  Mitigating against water pollution with state-of-the-art wastewater treatment processes for effluent discharge.  Development of innovative manufacturing processes such that substances with high water contamination potential are eliminated and substituted with materials that are easier to remove from water systems.  Invest in water treatment so that municipal treatment facilities are not overburdened by industrial waste-water.  Collect and treat agricultural run-off and use as fresh water source.  Integrate gray water back into building operations, reducing the amount of potable water needed to flush toilets.   Reduce the likelihood of groundwater contamination by treating and processing all waste with exceptional precaution, according to local and federal guidelines.  Invest in clean-up when necessary, restoring sites to pre-spill quality levels.   Educate consumers about appropriate water behaviors, explaining global water quality and scarcity issues, thus attempting to shift the negative implications of the use phase associated with many consumer products.  Invest in water and sanitation projects or infrastructure in under-served regions.  Ensure that all employees and their families have ample access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, and raise awareness about hygiene practices.  Invest in clean-ups and restoration of water ecosystems to ensure sustainable water withdrawals.  Prohibit the use of chemicals and materials that can be particularly detrimental to water quality if improperly disposed.  Working with other groups such as governments, community groups, peer companies to improve local water governance or on water projects to address identified challenges.   Ensure that the voices of women and girls, who are disproportionately impacted by inadequate WASH facilities, are included in water and sanitation management strategies.  Average water intensity in water-stressed or water-scarce areas   Total water withdrawal by source  Water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water  Percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused   Total water discharge by quality and destination  Identity, size, protected status, and biodiversity value of water bodies and related habitats significantly affected by the organization’s discharges of water and runoff   Number of employees receiving hygiene training and awareness raising    WBCSD Global Water Tool   Water Footprint Network (WFN) Assessment Tool  Water use assessment within LCA   6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all  6.2 By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations  6.3 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally  6.4 By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity, and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity  6.5 By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate 6.6 By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes  6.a By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water and sanitation related activities and programs, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies  6.b Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management  Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all Modern society depends on reliable and affordable energy services to function smoothly and to develop equitably. A well-established energy system supports all sectors from medicine and education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high-technology. Intensive development patterns have historically relied on inexpensive and energy-dense fossil fuels, which also happen to be the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. However, new, clean technologies are available that can reorient development along a more sustainable trajectory.   Business can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Also, with investment in R&D, businesses can innovate and pioneer new technologies that change the status quo of the global energy system, becoming the center of climate change solutions.   Electricity access  Electricity availability and reliability  Renewable energy   Energy efficiency  Infrastructure investments Environmental investments  Ensure that all employees and their families have access to a reliable and affordable source of energy by investing in local infrastructure to establish accessible energy services.  Commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable sources.   Reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy intensive modes such as train travel over auto and air travel.   Invest in R&D related to sustainable energy services, bringing new technologies to the market quickly.  Integrate renewable energy into employee benefits packages, subsidizing the capital expenditures associated with residential solar or electric vehicle investments.  As women typically drive much of the energy consumption at the household level, companies have an opportunity to invest and train women to become renewable energy entrepreneurs.  Prioritize energy efficiency across operations through tools such as the use of an internal carbon price and science-based target setting to reduce overall demand for energy.  Planned capacity against project electricity demand over the long term, broken down by energy source and regulatory regime   Percentage of population unserved in licensed distribution or service areas   How much fuel, electricity, heat, steam and cooling in MWh your organization has purchased and consumed during the reporting year   Energy consumption within the organization  Energy consumption outside of the organization  7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services  7.2 Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030  7.3 double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030  7.a By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technologies, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technologies, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technologies  7.b By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, particularly LDCs and SIDS  Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns More people globally are expected to join the middle class over the next two decades. These socioeconomic and demographic changes are good for individual prosperity but will increase demand for already constrained natural resources. Societies need to find just and equitable ways to meet individual needs and aspirations within the ecological limits of the planet. Sustainable practices in the production phase of products and services will not provide sufficient responses to meet science-based emissions reduction targets, natural resource constraints or the growing demand for basic needs such as food, water and sanitation, and access to energy. Furthermore, demand for materials will likely outpace efficiency gains in supply chains as well as overwhelm already stretched ecosystem services. Consumption patterns need to be made sustainable, particularly lifestyles in industrialized societies, and reduce their ecological footprint to allow for the regeneration of natural resources on which human life and biodiversity depend.  It is in the interest of business to find new solutions that enable sustainable consumption and production patterns. A better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and services is needed, both of product life cycles and how these are affected by use within lifestyles. Identifying “hot spots” within the value chain where interventions have the greatest potential to improve the environmental and social impact of the system as a whole is a crucial first step. Business can use its innovative power to then design appropriate solutions that can both enable and inspire individuals to lead more sustainable lifestyles, reducing impacts and improving well-being.  Sustainable sourcing   Resource efficiency of products and services  Materials recycling  Procurement practices  Product and service information and labeling  Implement product portfolio analysis tools to understand environmental and social footprint of products within lifestyles as well as production. Innovation must align products and applications to appropriately address sustainability megatrends.  Develop innovative business models such as moving from selling products to selling services, to retain ownership of the products and help close the materials loop.  Enable sustainable consumption by developing innovative solutions can reduce energy need in usage and educate consumers about these benefits.  Reduce manufacturing impacts by substituting virgin raw materials in products with post-consumer materials through recycling and upcycling.   Apply modular design, so products’ constituent parts will be easily separated and either re-used without further processing, or easily recycled near the point of disposal.  Significantly reduce waste and ensure that any unavoidable waste is utilized to the fullest degree (e.g. organic waste as fuel or fertilizer).

These threats place further pressure on environmental systems, like biodiversity and natural infrastructure, while creating global socio-economic problems, including health, safety and financial risks. In order to combat these issues and promote ocean sustainability, innovative solutions that prevent and mitigate detrimental impacts to marine environments are essential. World leaders must also work to protect marine species and support the people who depend on oceans, whether it be for employment, resources, or leisure.  Businesses have a role to play in the area of ocean management as their practices and operations can greatly affect marine life and resources as well as generate waste and pollution. Beyond those industries that directly depend on marine ecosystem services and its biodiversity (e.g. aquaculture, food and beverage, tourism and hospitality, extractives and energy), all businesses share some responsibility for the conservation and sustainable use of ocean and marine resources.  At the same time, oceans greatly contribute to the global economy. As estimated recently by the World Wildlife Fund, the total value of the oceans as an asset is at least 24 trillion USD, which includes direct outputs such as fishing, services such as tourism, trade and transport, as well as other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestering.  Marine biodiversity   Ocean acidification  Environmental investments   Spills  Sustainable sourcing Water discharge to oceans   Track the life cycle of products and materials in order to understand how they are disposed and which products could likely find their way into marine environments.  Record and disclose information on the chemical and material usage within products, packaging, and processing systems to facilitate closing the loop.  Improve resource efficiency by altering the design, manufacture, or use of products and packaging to reduce the amount of waste that could potentially enter the environment.  Improve resource efficiency by generating value from waste.  Replace, limit or prohibit the use of certain chemicals, additives, or materials that could prevent closing the loop or lead to nutrient pollution or chemical and physical hazards if they happen to reach marine ecosystems.  Prevent waste mismanagement or littering that could pollute the marine environment.  Raise consumer awareness on effective ways to properly dispose of their waste to discourage littering and promote responsible behavior.  Prohibit practices that put marine species and resources at further risk of harm, exploitation or depletion.  Contribute to the development of waste management technologies that minimize the use of clean water.    Utilize a value-chain approach to create connections between the design, packaging, marketing and recycling of materials with the goals of reducing their environmental impact at the end of their lifecycle.

Social Development,"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable By 2050, 70 % of the world’s population will live in cities, making cities critical in achieving a sustainable future for the world. Businesses, together with Governments at various levels, and civil society organizations and citizens are collectively engaged in pursuing ambitious objectives to make cities more competitive, safe, resource-efficient, resilient and inclusive. Key areas of need in achieving progress on Goal 11 are; 1) identifying and agreeing the most sustainable ways to achieve the targets- what activities should be ceased and which ones accelerated; 2) building appropriate capacity and skills across these stakeholder groups to deliver; 3) attracting/securing finance, innovative designs and delivery models and projects for integrated city infrastructure– including buildings, energy, mobility, telecommunications, water, sanitation and waste management services, and; 4) ensuring practical processes for multistakeholder engagement in all stages of urban development that build consensus, inclusion, resilience and sustainability.   Businesses can help cities navigate these challenges and turn a high-level vision into practical and implementable action plans. Business can play a vital role not only in providing specific infrastructure, technology, services and financing solutions, but also in contributing to the strategy that will support the overall optimization of urban systems to create inclusive, safe, sustainable and disaster resilient cities. Cities seeking to realize their sustainability objectives can benefit from engaging with business early in the planning and strategy development process, leveraging the capability of business to identify innovative and cost-effective solutions to complex, cross-cutting urban sustainability challenges.   Access to affordable housing   Infrastructure investments  Sustainable transportation  Access to public spaces Sustainable buildings  Jointly develop and/or participate in a sustainable community that brings together relevant stakeholders through a common and neutral platform to jointly analyze, discuss and act on urban functionality, resilience and sustainable development.

Failure to implement responsible business practices can result in additional costs and risks (financial, legal, reputational) to the business itself, and, can exacerbate tensions and instability in society and undermine the rule of law. Corruption causes inefficiencies in markets because it renders transaction costs uncertain, is anti-competitive, and hampers businesses’ ability to comply with human rights and other obligations.  By contrast, a responsible business can through its core business, strategic social investment, public policy engagement and collective action make meaningful contributions to lasting peace, development and prosperity while ensuring long-term business success. Among other things, businesses can commit to working with governments and civil society to eliminate corruption in all its forms and to support strengthening of the rule of law. By focusing on the ways responsible business contributes to advancing these three dimensions of sustainable development; conducting business responsibly in high-risk areas, fighting corruption, and respect and support for the rule of law- business can contribute to more peaceful and inclusive societies, and support effective and accountable institutions.   Effective, accountable and transparent governance  Compliance with laws and regulations  Anti-corruption  Public access to information  Physical and economic displacement  Inclusive decision making  Comply with laws and seek to meet international standards; require and support business partners to do the same.
