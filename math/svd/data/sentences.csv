1,United Health Group.pdf,"Costs remain an impediment to accessing care, particularly for  those in underserved communities."
1,United Health Group.pdf,Long-standing disparities in care have led to  unequal outcomes for various populations.

1,United Health Group.pdf,And adults with less than a high  school education had a 123% higher rate of frequent mental  distress than college graduates in that same time frame.
1,United Health Group.pdf,"Racial  disparities in maternal health have widened since 2005, with  Black mothers continuing to face a disproportionately higher  rate of mortality over time."
1,United Health Group.pdf,Deeply rooted disparities cannot be solved through a singular  program or initiative.

4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,The winning teams of 2021 included 26 innovators who delivered four breakthrough solutions:
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,Data science and digital health are fundamentally changing the face of healthcare.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,We are building a world class team that is fully integrated with all parts of R&D.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"We are assembling vast datasets into a data lab, and, in-house or with partners,  developing advanced analytical methods including AI and machine learning, to  analyze these data to solve problems that make our R&D teams more effective and  efficient, and often enable earlier delivery of new possibilities."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,We are increasingly leveraging data science and digital health to accelerate  innovation at every step of the R&D process to generate insights that allow us to  better understand the diseases we are tackling.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"For example, data science helps  us determine which compounds show the most promise, bring the best molecules  into clinical development and design, and execute clinical trials more effectively  for exactly the right patients."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"One major impact of using data science-driven  algorithms can be the earlier detection of disease in patients and determination of  the most suitable medicines, especially for those with progressive diseases."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"Today,  we have more than 100 data science and digital health projects, powering more  than 90% of our development pipeline."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"Generating unprecedented data to address multiple diseases: In January 2021,  we became a Founding Industry Member of the Our Future Health consortium,  which aims to collect one of the most comprehensive and most diverse datasets  ever from 5 million volunteers in the UK."

4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"In 2021, the Whole Genome  Sequencing (WGS) data for the first 200,000 UK Biobank participants (of a total  500,000) was made available to researchers to enable them to better understand  the role of genetics for health outcomes and potentially advance drug discovery  and development."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,The dataset will allow researchers globally to study the 98% of  genetic code that is not protein-coded and previously had no known purpose.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"Enhancing clinical trials: Data science is also enhancing the speed, efficiency   and inclusiveness of our clinical trials."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"In the early stages of the COVID-19  
pandemic, for example, we were able to gather comprehensive datasets and  leverage advanced analytics to understand how COVID-19 was spreading  worldwide, where it would likely peak next and where the potential for viral  mutations would be highest."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,These predictions proved remarkably accurate and  enabled us to place clinical trial sites in “hot spots” where participants would  be more likely to have exposure to COVID-19—meaning we could more quickly  determine the efficacy of vaccines.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,This helped reduce the vaccine development  timeline while generating efficacy data across multiple COVID-19 variants of  interest.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"This effort, undertaken with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  was recognized with the 2021 Innovative Applications in Analytics Award from  the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS),  regarding the creative and unique application of analytical techniques."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"Finding early markers of disease: Speed is critical when it comes to identifying  patients and providing the proper treatment, yet for many, rare and difficult-to- detect diseases, diagnosis often comes late—or never at all."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"For example, for  patients with PAH, the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is two  years, causing delay in treatment and a lower average five-year survival rate."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"Using the results of echocardiograms, we are applying AI, together with external  collaborators, to help identify early markers of PAH to help change the lives of  those living with the disease."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,Enabling more targeted therapies: The use of data science helps us select the  optimum therapy for individual patients.
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"For example, we are using AI to analyze  histopathology images from patients with bladder cancer to detect mutations  that may make patients more likely to respond to new medicines and facilitate  recruitment into clinical trials for potentially lifesaving therapies."
4,Johnson-Johnson.pdf,"We are also  leveraging data science to help identify the most appropriate people for our  Phase 3 trial for a vaccine to prevent certain E. coli infections, that are becoming  increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics."

5,NVDIA.pdf,"Each year we share in our corporate responsibility report the hard work the people  of NVIDIA have done to create a more sustainable company and to make a positive  impact in our communities, on society, and on the planet."
5,NVDIA.pdf,NVIDIA is guided by a set of principles that we’ve held close to heart since our first  days.
5,NVDIA.pdf,Build a company that attracts the world’s best people in our field.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Give them  a place to do their life’s work, where they can build a great life for their family."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Do  the really hard things that no one has done – whose solutions will have a great  impact on society.
5,NVDIA.pdf,Do things that we are uniquely able to do.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"These principles have guided us through our company’s history, but the great  battle with COVID—and ways we took it on—gives them deeper meaning."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"At the onset of the pandemic, we moved quickly to ensure our employees were  safe by closing our offices and retooling NVIDIA to be a global distributed  workforce."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We made sure our families were secure by pulling raises in by six  months, and we committed to paying our hourly contract workers."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Our people came together to help those in need around the world.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Together,  employees and the company have contributed $17 million to support COVID-related  causes in more than 40 countries, most recently in India where a second wave is  underway as I write this."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"On the technology front, we have worked with scientists, researchers, doctors,  and hospitals around the world—hundreds of initiatives in all—to simulate the  virus, understand its mechanics, develop vaccines and treatments, automate  hospitals, and arm medical professionals with new tools to help them save lives."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"NVIDIA-powered computers, from small autonomous machines to the most  powerful supercomputer in the U.S., were called into service."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"NVIDIA AI software  was used to sequence the virus genome, design tests, predict patient oxygen  needs in the ICU, and even optimize and turbo-charge clinical trials when every  second counted."

5,NVDIA.pdf,"This will not be the last virus,  but we can make it the last pandemic."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"And even while this battle has waged on, we are reminded that climate change  continues its march."
5,NVDIA.pdf,The stakes are nothing short of existential.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We all must  act.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Whether through the cloud or in their own data centers, companies are  consuming ever more compute power as they embrace technologies like AI."
5,NVDIA.pdf,NVIDIA accelerated computing can meet these demands at lower energy  consumption than traditional methods.
5,NVDIA.pdf,The most energy efficient system on the  TOP500 list of supercomputers is our own NVIDIA DGx SuperPOD.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"In all, 26 of the  30 world’s greenest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Our end-to-end AI supercomputing platform powered by NVIDIA Ampere  architecture A100 GPUs are up to 40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU  servers when running AI and high-performance computing workloads.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"An  A100-powered hyperscale data center takes up 1/50th, just 2 percent, the rack  space of the CPU-based systems that it replaces."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"If all CPU servers running AI and HPC transitioned to GPUs, the world would  save 11 terawatt hours of electricity per year—equivalent to taking two coal-fired  power plants offline or removing 1.7M cars from the road."
5,NVDIA.pdf,We’re also committed to powering our own data center operations with more  renewable energy.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"In FY21, 17 of our locations were fully powered by renewable  energy."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Our goal is to derive 65 percent of our global electricity use from sources  like solar by 2025.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"As we published last year’s report, millions around the world had taken to the  streets in peaceful protest to demand justice for Black and African Americans."
5,NVDIA.pdf,It was a call to action for all of us.

5,NVDIA.pdf,I’m proud that we’ve tripled Black and African American employees in the past year.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"And we became a much more diverse company globally, welcoming over 2,000  Mellanox employees from Israel and the Palestinian Authority."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We appointed  leaders focused on inclusion, and on recruiting and retaining diverse talent, as  well as on creating a more inclusive developer ecosystem."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We still have a lot of  work to do, but I’m excited about our progress and where we’re headed."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Through the decades, we have stayed close to our principles because we believe  in them."
5,NVDIA.pdf,We know that they are the right things to do.
5,NVDIA.pdf,But this year we were reminded  that these principles aren’t just about building a great company and leaving the  world in better shape than we found it.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We learned that the company we’ve built,  all of us, have great power to improve lives, and that our work can and will be  called into service at any time to save them."
5,NVDIA.pdf,It’s a great responsibility but one that brings us incredible joy.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"It drives us every  day to apply our talents, our inventions, and our generosity to the world’s most  exciting opportunities and toughest challenges."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Our employees are what makes NVIDIA great, and when we put them and their  families first, our company and stakeholders prosper."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We create technology  that benefits people all over the world, and we continually endeavor to make our  products more energy efficient to curb climate change."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Corporate responsibility is critical to NVIDIA’s mission and is a key priority for our  board of directors and management as well as with every employee.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We believe in transparency and strong engagement with all stakeholders.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We set  our CSR goals and priorities every year based on feedback from stakeholders and  with the intention to be better than we need to be.
5,NVDIA.pdf,This report serves to provide a  clear understanding of our priorities and our progress.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"When it became clear that COVID-19 was a global pandemic that threatened all  of us, we made it a priority to take care of our people first."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We closed our offices  immediately, began working remotely, and focused on their safety and well  being."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Only the employees essential to keeping our data centers running so the  rest of the company could work remotely were allowed on our campuses, and  they were admitted under strict safety protocols to keep them safe."
5,NVDIA.pdf,We provided our employees with enhanced health coverage and mental health  support and moved up our yearly performance review to give our employees  raises sooner.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We took steps to ensure our campus contractors and vendors  were compensated, and we repurposed our sites with cafeterias to provide  meals to local families in California and India."
5,NVDIA.pdf,And NVIDIANs came together to help charities.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Together with contributions  from the company, they donated more than $16 million to COVID-related efforts  all over the world."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"And when India was struck with a second wave of COVID  this spring, employees and the company immediately donated another $1  million to provide oxygen concentrators, ICU beds, and hygiene and food kits to  communities across the country."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Our commitment to ensuring our people and their communities were taken  care of and productive while working from home has paid off.

5,NVDIA.pdf,Last year NVIDIA’s CEO made a pretty definitive statement around needing to do  more to further racial justice.
5,NVDIA.pdf,What has NVIDIA done in this area?
5,NVDIA.pdf,When Jensen said it’s not enough to just not be a racist company—we all took it  to heart.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We’re making assertive steps to create a more diverse workplace and a  company that will better serve humanity.
5,NVDIA.pdf,Representation and inclusion start at the top.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Twenty-three percent of our board  members are women and 38% are gender, racially, or ethnically diverse."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Among  our employees, we’re increasing representation through a focused hiring effort,  and last year we connected with 47,000 underrepresented candidates through  virtual university and professional career events."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We filled three leadership roles  key to creating an equitable company: heads of inclusion and belonging, ethical  AI, and diversity recruiting."
5,NVDIA.pdf,We use this report to be transparent in reporting pay and workplace equality  data.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We’re proud that this is our sixth year in achieving pay parity, and in the  last year we’ve tripled Black and African American employees in the U.S. We  recognize we still have a lot to do to improve representation across NVIDIA, but  we’re pleased with our progress to date."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Our commitment to inclusion extends beyond our company to ensure our AI   developer ecosystem is more representative of the global population.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"In  partnership with several university and professional organizations, we increased  by 4-5x the number of women and Black and Latino developers at our most  recent developers conference."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"And to build a future pipeline of developer and  employee talent, we’re partnering with nonprofits to expand curriculum access to  AI for students in underrepresented communities."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"As we look ahead, we see our commitments and choices coming to fruition."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We’ll  continue our focus on employees and their families as a top priority, and harness  their innovation to build products that make a lasting contribution to humanity."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We’ll continue hiring and promoting diverse talent across the company, with a  focus on increasing diverse representation in leadership."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"And we’re undertaking  efforts to create a more inclusive environment, through career acceleration  initiatives and development of a manager playbook, while seeking guidance from  our numerous employee resource groups on what we can do to create a place  where all employees can do amazing work."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Finally, we recognize the need of companies to act on climate change."
5,NVDIA.pdf,We are  focusing on the carbon emissions footprint across our product lifecycle and  developing initiatives such as net-zero and science-based targets.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We look  forward to sharing more in the coming months.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We update our issue analysis each year to ensure that our priorities remain  aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and  opportunities."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"For FY22, we have reconfirmed the eight priority issues we  identified in FY21."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"These issues are essential to our continued business success  and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders: 
A strategic focus on these areas enables us to build a more agile, future-oriented  company."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We implement several initiatives related to our priorities annually,  which provide varying levels of return according to the business goals assigned  to the topic."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"> Throughout the year, the CSR  Committee collects input from  internal and external stakeholders  regarding their priorities."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Each  issue is assigned a quantitative  score based on this input.
5,NVDIA.pdf,> Members of the Nominating and  Corporate Governance Committee  of our Board of Directors and  several executive staff members  review these issues.
5,NVDIA.pdf,A third party  then individually ranks each issue  according to stakeholder input.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Each issue is evaluated in the  context of our changing business,  and internal enterprise risk  discussions."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"> The CSR Committee positions  the issues on a matrix according  to stakeholder and executive  feedback, highlighting the most  important issues to external  stakeholders and executives."
5,NVDIA.pdf," > We changed the names of two issues to better reflect  both our management of them and stakeholder  expectations: Trustworthy AI (from Societal Impacts of  AI); Data Centers, Labs, and Office Management (from  Facilities Management);  
 > We consolidated three issues into the definitions of  other issues: Recycling/E-waste (into Waste), Supplier  Environmental Management (into Supply Chain  Management), and Transport and Logistics (into  Climate Change)."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"> We determined the following issues decreased  in stakeholder priority: Community Engagement,  Customer Relations, Energy, Waste, Water,  Human Rights, Materials Sourcing, Public Policy  Engagement, and Product Safety."

5,NVDIA.pdf,"We dedicate ourselves to building  a just, decent, and inclusive  company."
5,NVDIA.pdf,We believe it is not  enough to be a company that does  not oppress underrepresented  communities.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We must be  empathetic to their experience  and act to make NVIDIA a place  of opportunities—a place they  can do their life’s work.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We do  this because it is right and just,  and because we believe it will  help make NVIDIA better.”"
5,NVDIA.pdf,Engaging our diverse stakeholders on important issues is integral to how we do business.
5,NVDIA.pdf,We define stakeholders  as entities or individuals who can be affected by NVIDIA and whose actions can affect the company.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"We rely on our  annual priority issue assessment to help us understand the issues that matter most to them, which allows us to  focus our engagement and transparently respond to their concerns."
5,NVDIA.pdf,Members of the CSR Committee are assigned  based on subject-matter expertise to evaluate each stakeholder request to determine what type of response is  appropriate.
5,NVDIA.pdf,The issue most commonly raised across multiple stakeholders last year was racial and social justice.
5,NVDIA.pdf,"In June 2020,  our CEO Jensen Huang addressed the racial inequities present in the United States and committed to elevate the  urgency of increasing the Black population at every level of our company."
5,NVDIA.pdf,"Throughout the latter half of FY21, we  received stakeholder requests to disclose our EEO data and commitments to diversity and inclusion within our  workforce."

6,Broadcom.pdf,"While  these audits are typically on-site audits at the  supplier location, we adjusted and primarily  conducted our audits remotely in 2021 due   to the COVID-19 pandemic."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"We seek to source goods and services from  minority-owned, woman-owned, historically  underutilized businesses, veteran-owned,  service-disabled veteran-owned, small and  disadvantaged businesses that are able to  provide quality goods and services in a   timely and competitive manner."
6,Broadcom.pdf,We also  include women- and minority-owned firms   in our corporate debt financing syndicates.

raised in our 2020 supplier human  rights survey—specifically four  suppliers who used fines to discipline  workers and one supplier who did not  permit collective bargaining no longer  engage in these prohibited practices 
We identified and surveyed our  largest suppliers globally (based  on 2020 supplier spend data) that  were not part of our 2020 supplier  human rights survey."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"These suppliers,  collectively with the suppliers  surveyed in 2020, represent over  90% of our supply chain (based on  our 2020 supplier spend)."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"We found no instances of forced  labor, child labor, slavery or human  trafficking among Broadcom’s  suppliers."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"However, we identified one  supplier, who is located in Europe,  who may use fines as a method of  discipline for its workers."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"While this  practice is legal in the jurisdiction  and the supplier has a well-defined  written escalating disciplinary  process supported by the local trade  union, we have actively engaged with  this supplier and requested that it  discontinues this practice."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"In 2021, as part of our ongoing efforts to educate and raise awareness of  forced labor and human trafficking issues, we required human rights awareness  and forced labor prevention training for relevant employees in our Global  Operations, HR, Legal, Procurement and supply chain functions who have a  direct responsibility for supply chain management."
6,Broadcom.pdf,Our employees working  with our U.S. government customers participate in combating trafficking in  persons training and prevention of forced labor training on an annual basis.

6,Broadcom.pdf,We continued our annual due diligence of our supply chain for the use  of conflict minerals in the design and manufacturing of our products in  conjunction with our annual SEC reporting.
6,Broadcom.pdf,"Due to the nature of our supply  chain where we outsource most of our manufacturing, we do not typically  have a direct relationship with the smelters and refiners (SORs)."
6,Broadcom.pdf,"In 2020, 95% (245 out of 259) of the active SORs potentially in our supply  chain were certified “conflict free” under the RMAP audit process."
6,Broadcom.pdf,This high  level of conformance is due to our on-going efforts to identify conflict minerals  risks in our supply chain and encourage our suppliers to purchase materials  only from SORs that are certified as “conflict free” in compliance with RMAP  protocols.
6,Broadcom.pdf,"For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Policy and our   2020 Conflict Minerals Report."

8,Tesla.pdf,Current ESG evaluation  methodologies are  fundamentally flawed.
8,Tesla.pdf,"To  achieve acutely-needed  change, ESG needs to  evolve to measure real- world Impact."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Current environmental, social and governance (ESG)  reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact  on the world."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar  value of risk / return."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG  funds of large investment institutions – are perhaps  unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of  companies that make climate change worse, not better."
8,Tesla.pdf,An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the  automotive industry.
8,Tesla.pdf,"One might think that the more electric  vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total  volumes, the better its ESG score."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, this is not the  case."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As long as a company continues to slightly decrease  emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning  out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of  total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG  reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all."
8,Tesla.pdf,"“The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is  how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to  get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to  factor at all.” 
We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes  actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting  individual investors can choose to support companies that  can make and prioritize positive change."
8,Tesla.pdf,"On the product front, companies should be required to use  real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it  clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world  figures."
8,Tesla.pdf,"An example of this is vehicle “use-phase”  emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle  emissions."
8,Tesla.pdf,Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle  mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically  and almost never reflect real-world data.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Automakers often  have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential  that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent  discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe  workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with  significant upside if their employer does well."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the  profitability of the company?” We need a system that  evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a  positive impact on the world?” 
This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by  institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies  and the general public."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the world needs to strive for a  substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in  this report."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Instead, we’ll talk about Impact."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The 6.8 million metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use-phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real-world fuel economy of  
~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The 1.6 million metric tons of  
solar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero-emission electricity from Tesla solar panels, including energy stored and later dispatched from our  
energy storage products."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Geographic distribution of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Burned fossil fuel is extremely difficult to decarbonize as carbon capture is not economically viable today 
Battery pack is recycled at the end-of-life and used to build a brand-new battery pack, over and over again."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla solar panels have generated more electricity than has been consumed by our vehicles and factories between 2012 and 2021
8,Tesla.pdf,We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to  sustainable energy.
8,Tesla.pdf,"To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the  accessibility of our products."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million  electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year  (compared to 4 GWh in 2021)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle  fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e  emissions every year of usage."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from  manufacturing to consumer use to recycling."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our  customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products."
8,Tesla.pdf,Each of these themes will  be covered in this year’s Impact Report.
8,Tesla.pdf,Sustainability drives us.
8,Tesla.pdf,And not just our products — it drives our values and mission as a company.
8,Tesla.pdf,It's at the  core of everything we do and is what motivates us in our work.
8,Tesla.pdf,"It also matters greatly to our customers,  employees and shareholders."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our products and services are focused on transportation, energy production and  storage — each of which have traditionally been some of the biggest polluters both in the U.S. and globally."
8,Tesla.pdf,"To achieve a zero-emissions future, we continue to implement programs and initiatives at our global  manufacturing facilities and in our local communities."
8,Tesla.pdf,Climate change is reaching alarming levels globally due in large part to emissions from burning fossil fuels for  transportation and electricity generation.
8,Tesla.pdf,The world cannot reduce GHG emissions without addressing both  energy generation and consumption.
8,Tesla.pdf,And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly  reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.
8,Tesla.pdf,We are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem.
8,Tesla.pdf,We both develop the  technology behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability of the products that comprise it.
8,Tesla.pdf,We seek to  achieve this through our R&D and software development efforts as well as through our continuous drive to  develop advanced manufacturing capabilities.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Tesla, sustainability is everyone's job regardless of their position, geographic location or title."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our  Sustainability Council, made up of leaders from across Tesla, collects data and prepares the analysis and  content of this report."
8,Tesla.pdf,The Sustainability Council also presents this information to Tesla’s Board of Directors for  review.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s  business — including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this  report."
8,Tesla.pdf,"With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers  and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry  Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020."
8,Tesla.pdf,Implicit in this approach is the  importance of sound corporate governance.
8,Tesla.pdf,Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission.
8,Tesla.pdf,We are committed to establishing an operating  framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and  manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that  should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla’s Code of  Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We encourage Tesla  employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do  so."
8,Tesla.pdf,We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement.
8,Tesla.pdf,We  have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.
8,Tesla.pdf,We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla keeps  information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our policies  prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints.
8,Tesla.pdf,We are committed to  maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns  about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance.
8,Tesla.pdf,And our mission requires a long-term  focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our corporate  governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some,  but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Some examples include our decisions to: 
• Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV  components 
• Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite  regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so 
• Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively 
• Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to  create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their  own utility 
• Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the  future 
These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately,  decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the  annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%."
8,Tesla.pdf,"At the same time, the  Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs  stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For example, at  our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an  amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, our  stockholders did not approve that proposal."
8,Tesla.pdf,The Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and  participates in robust shareholder outreach and feedback.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, our directors have significant experience  as either top-level executives at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs who founded  successful organizations."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each  further described in the following pages."
8,Tesla.pdf,Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent  director under the listing standards of NASDAQ.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, as part of our governance review and succession  planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership  structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and  performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates  candidates for election or re-election to the Board."
8,Tesla.pdf,Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the  growing risks and opportunities around ESG.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for  assessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day-to-day basis."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of  certain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on  matters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, assisting the Board in providing oversight of  Tesla’s accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of its financial statements, including  oversight over the integrity of such statements, the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory  requirements, the independent auditor’s qualifications, independence and performance, the organization and  performance of the Company’s internal audit function, as well as the Company’s internal accounting and  financial controls, treasury and finance matters, risk management, including data privacy and cybersecurity."
8,Tesla.pdf,The  Audit Committee also reviews and discusses the accounting assessment of this report and other ESG  disclosures.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, discharging the Board’s responsibilities in  administering and overseeing Tesla’s compensation policies, plans and benefit programs, the compensation of  Tesla’s executive officers and members of the Board, the administration of the Company’s employee benefit  plans and the review of human capital management practices related to Tesla’s talent generally (including how  Tesla recruits, develops and retains diverse talent)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Disclosure Controls Committee, among other things, implements, reviews and monitors Tesla’s compliance  with applicable legal requirements governing the Company’s and its executive officers’ public disclosures and  public statements relating to the Company."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and  making recommendations to the Board on matters concerning corporate governance, Board composition, the  identification, evaluation and nomination of director candidates and composition of Board committees and  conflicts of interest."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, this Committee oversees Tesla’s corporate governance practices and reviews  annually the principles of corporate governance approved by the Board, including the Company’s Code of  Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, to ensure that they remain relevant and are being  complied with and monitored by management, recommending changes to the Board as necessary."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily  in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear  and measurable milestones."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of  stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive  officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any  perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees.
8,Tesla.pdf,"No  named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s  performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award."
8,Tesla.pdf,"A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of  the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on  Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational  milestones of the Award."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected  the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on  such base salary."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, he has never accepted his salary."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we  eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s  compensation is at-risk."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our  compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in  order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the  long-term interests of our stockholders."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted  stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based  compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value  and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through  the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are  sold."
8,Tesla.pdf,The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that  are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each  director.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic  grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board  determines otherwise."
8,Tesla.pdf,We believe that responsible data management and transparency is a prerequisite for continuous innovation.
8,Tesla.pdf,We  live up to this commitment by providing information and controls in our products that let you choose how your  personal data is collected and used.
8,Tesla.pdf,Data privacy is a shared responsibility in which every employee and our Board is expected to participate.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla  has a large and diverse team of privacy and security professionals from all over the world and across legal,  engineering and product organizations, who are dedicated to protecting customer data."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, the Audit  Committee of the Tesla Board of Directors is regularly briefed on incidents, emerging trends, controls and  corrective actions taken by Tesla to ensure we are living up to our obligations and Privacy Principles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla is guided not only legally by its obligations under global privacy laws and regulations, but also by  customer expectations and our Privacy Principles."
8,Tesla.pdf,We do the right thing with data.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We maintain trust by handling data as customers expect, keeping it accurate  and complete and properly destroying it when it is no longer needed."
8,Tesla.pdf,• We build privacy into our products from start to finish.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Ensuring privacy is an important component when  building world-class products and services, from inception to rollout and beyond."
8,Tesla.pdf,• We give customers choices about their data.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We put individuals in control by giving them clear and  transparent ways to access, review, manage and delete their data with ease."
8,Tesla.pdf,• We maintain trust through transparency.
8,Tesla.pdf,We are clear about the personal data we collect and how we're  using or sharing it – ensuring that choosing a connected vehicle does not come at the sacrifice of customer  privacy.
8,Tesla.pdf,• We safeguard personal data.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We implement rigorous controls and standards designed to protect the security,  confidentiality and integrity of Tesla’s data environment."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla’s Privacy Principles and commitments are illustrated throughout all our products.
8,Tesla.pdf,"For Tesla vehicles,  customer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle  data generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in-vehicle  menu to adjust preferences at any time.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, energy products are designed to protect customer privacy."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla  aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary in providing the most engaging in-app energy  experience.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In furtherance of transparency, Tesla has developed a seamless way for customers to download and  access their energy data at any time right from the Tesla app."
8,Tesla.pdf,We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road.
8,Tesla.pdf,"To do that, our team of  world-class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible."
8,Tesla.pdf,"And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build  inherently secure systems, we cannot work alone."
8,Tesla.pdf,We work closely with the security research community to  benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that  every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over-the-air (OTA) software updates.
8,Tesla.pdf,"These updates have  introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to  drive."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when  they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime."
8,Tesla.pdf,The ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future.
8,Tesla.pdf,We believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our human rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the  values they represent.
8,Tesla.pdf,We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human  Rights (UDHR).

8,Tesla.pdf,"We  are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain — including with respect to our  employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities in which we operate."
8,Tesla.pdf,We require that our  suppliers will also support and promote these values in their own operations and in those of their own suppliers.

8,Tesla.pdf,"While many manufacturers are trimming  their operations, we are growing as quickly as is feasible."
8,Tesla.pdf,Significant upside potential: Every single employee of our company can receive their grants in stocks or  options.
8,Tesla.pdf,"If our company does well, every employee can benefit materially from Tesla’s success."
8,Tesla.pdf,Outstanding benefits: We want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing industry.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Among other  benefits, we provide medical, dental and vision plans with no paycheck deductions, 401k matching, life  insurance, parental leave and family building benefits."
8,Tesla.pdf,Build the future: Who wouldn’t want to work for a company with a mission of building a future we all want?

8,Tesla.pdf,"We had more than 3,000,000 unique applicants globally in 2021  alone."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We expanded access to hiring opportunities for underrepresented communities by centering diversity, equity  and inclusion (DEI) in our hiring process."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We did so by increasing gender-neutral language in our job  descriptions, broadening our sourcing efforts, revamping interviewing guides, building community partnerships,  educating on unconscious bias and facilitating training for recruiters, hiring managers and interview panelists."
8,Tesla.pdf,"According to Universum 2021 rankings, engineering students want to work for Tesla and SpaceX more than any  other organization."
8,Tesla.pdf,Many successful companies with great engineering can become bureaucratic over time.
8,Tesla.pdf,We don’t want to go  that route.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Tesla, great engineering ideas worth implementing can come from interns, analysts or executives."
8,Tesla.pdf,We strive to minimize red tape so our engineers can be creative and solve engineering problems that have  never been solved.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Ultimately, the long-term success of any company comes down to the pace of innovation."

8,Tesla.pdf,"We are continuing to provide the local community access to thousands of job openings across the U.S. in  manufacturing, vehicle service and solar roof installation, offering full benefits and training from day one."
8,Tesla.pdf,We  have long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college degree to work at Tesla.
8,Tesla.pdf,This represents  an enormous opportunity for high school graduates from underserved communities to join us in our mission and  grow their careers.
8,Tesla.pdf,This is a two-year program where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at Tesla as a production  associate while continuing their education in automation and robotics at a local community college.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since its  launch in 2017, we've hired 168 graduates into this program, with active programs at Gigafactory Nevada,  Gigafactory New York and our Fremont Factory."
8,Tesla.pdf,We also launched our first Manufacturing Development  Program class with Del Valle High School to support Gigafactory Texas in fall 2021.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In partnership with local community colleges, Tesla offers a federal and state certified Tool & Die Apprenticeship  program in the U.S. at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada and Tesla Grand Rapids."
8,Tesla.pdf,"These apprenticeships  blend on-the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to  learning a trade in high demand."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical  skills."

8,Tesla.pdf,Evaluations for promotions also take place annually.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While  share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based  compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive  change for the benefit of all."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes  of working at Tesla."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares  quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20  Tesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, the same vest two  years later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per  share of Tesla stock over that period."
8,Tesla.pdf,Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through  the Employee Stock Purchase Program.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla HR offers a Pay Equity & Pay Transparency educational course to everyone in the People Organization,  with a focus on HR partners and recruiters."

8,Tesla.pdf,A recorded version of the  course is available to all hiring managers.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We also have an annual pay equity program in place, designed to assess whether similarly situated employees  are paid in a similar manner after accounting for a range of variables such as:"
8,Tesla.pdf,We proudly offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ health and well-being.
8,Tesla.pdf,These benefits allow  our employees to choose the level of support that is right for them.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We offer no-cost paycheck contributions for  medical, dental and vision plan options for employees and family members."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We also offer employer-paid life,  short- and long-term disability, confidential counseling for employees and their families, employee assistance  programs and voluntary benefit programs."

8,Tesla.pdf,"When going through a challenging period or when the viability of a business is not yet clear, it’s likely to have  an impact on employee satisfaction."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our early years of Model 3 production and global expansion were some of  the most difficult in our history and our employee satisfaction ratings (Glassdoor) reflected that.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our company is in a different phase now.
8,Tesla.pdf,Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and  profitability (operating margin) rose to the highest in the industry.
8,Tesla.pdf,This has fueled our ability to expand  dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Compensation, linked to the  performance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years."
8,Tesla.pdf,"There’s still a lot of work to be done, predominantly when it comes to work-life balance."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our goals have always  been, and still are, bold."
8,Tesla.pdf,Expectations are understandably high as a result.
8,Tesla.pdf,We recently introduced unlimited  vacation for salaried employees and added more family benefits.
8,Tesla.pdf,Both Glassdoor rankings as well as our internal  data show that our employees are becoming happier as a result of our growing success as well as our expanded  employee benefit programs.
8,Tesla.pdf,We believe our employees should have opportunities without limitations.
8,Tesla.pdf,Employees that start in junior roles  can ultimately become company leaders – and many of our long-term employees have done exactly that.
8,Tesla.pdf,Upward mobility in our fast environment is a significant contributor to retaining top talent.
8,Tesla.pdf,We want to make  sure that our employees continue to learn and evolve.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As nearly 70% of our leadership is promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of  successful progression."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our global headcount increased by over 40% in 2021.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At that pace of growth, some level  of external hiring will be necessary."
8,Tesla.pdf,"If possible, we do our best to fill each leadership role with an internal  candidate."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2020, we instituted quarterly diversity data reviews across different divisions."
8,Tesla.pdf,These ensure that we identify  trends across functions instead of simply looking at our workforce at the company-wide level.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Executives review  organizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to  attract, develop and retain talent."
8,Tesla.pdf,"That same year, we also took steps to incorporate DEI principles into talent management."
8,Tesla.pdf,The fundamental pillar  in this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews — a reliable review process leads to more equitable  access to internal opportunities.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all  employees globally."
8,Tesla.pdf,The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees'  access to career opportunities within Tesla.
8,Tesla.pdf,We expanded our leadership development team with a focus on providing DEI offerings to all our U.S.  employees.
8,Tesla.pdf,Now all employees are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation and  can continue their DEI learning journey throughout their time at Tesla.
8,Tesla.pdf,"From our allyship resources, to DEI Life  Hacks on our DEI Knowledge Center, to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive interviewing  and inclusive leadership, our employees have access to information no matter where they are."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our DEI team uses a people-first and data-driven approach to champion diversity, equity and inclusion in our  business and in the communities in which we operate."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We rely on the following guiding principles: 
• Provide transparency in our DEI programs, identify areas of improvement, celebrate successes and  continually iterate and improve our DEI approach 
• Focus on sustainable solutions that solve problems at the root cause and reimagine new programs with DEI  principles embedded in the design 
• Share knowledge throughout all levels of the organization to aid in personal and professional learning and  development"
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities  that have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of  December 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents were non-white."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This is a large percentage,  considering that just 0.3% of our employees are director level and above at Tesla."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our  intentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions,  activations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTech, as well as  community partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are also working to  ensure that the diversity in our entry-level roles will, over time and because of internal movement, be reflected  in our leadership roles."

8,Tesla.pdf,Competitor data is based on their latest publicly available disclosure.
8,Tesla.pdf,"For a detailed explanation of our comparison methodology, please see page 134 of this report."
8,Tesla.pdf,The diversity gap is even more pronounced when compared to automotive manufacturers.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In nearly every job  category, our employee base is more racially diverse than the automotive industry average."
8,Tesla.pdf,This is partially a  function of the location of our factories.
8,Tesla.pdf,"That said, our journey towards diversity, equity and inclusion is not  finished and we continue to develop programs to make sure our employee base reflects the diversity of our  country's population."
8,Tesla.pdf,The table below shows Tesla employee distribution compared to average employee distribution of U.S.  automotive companies.

8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla also supports numerous organizations that sponsor  veteran hiring and have expanded outreach efforts throughout the country to more military bases and  community organizations.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla prides itself in being a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ+ community.
8,Tesla.pdf,This is demonstrated  by our 7th consecutive 100% Corporate Equality Index with the Human Rights Campaign.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tracking the size of our  LGBTQ+ employee base is not a straightforward task for variety of reasons, which is why we will not be sharing  specific figures in this report."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our DEI governance structure supports our business operations.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our Senior Director of People engages with our  Board of Directors to ensure our DEI plans are in alignment with Tesla’s strategic objectives.

8,Tesla.pdf,"Data are representative of calendar year 2021, as measured on December 31, 2021."
8,Tesla.pdf,Totals may not add to 100% due to rounding or individuals  who selected “decline to state” or left the category blank.
8,Tesla.pdf,"During the global pandemic, we focused a great deal on expanding our community engagement and ensuring  our employees stayed connected."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Specifically, we expanded our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and  ensured our programming was accessible in a remote work environment."
8,Tesla.pdf,We welcomed Asian Pacific Islanders  at Tesla to our ERG family.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our  employees felt more heard and connected than ever before as they pivoted to virtual events to promote  inclusion across different locations, physical boundaries and time zones."
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities to provide  goods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We formalized collaboration between the  DEI, Supply Chain and Government Affairs teams to ensure local minority, women, LGBTQ+, disabled and  veteran owned businesses are connected to opportunities with Tesla."
8,Tesla.pdf,We recognize that supplier diversity  creates a competitive advantage for the company and has a positive impact on the global community.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the  supplier diversity program develops, we will implement plans that encourage increased usage of diverse  suppliers throughout our organization, partner with internal and external stakeholders to identify opportunities  for diverse suppliers and work with external partners to encourage capacity building for diverse suppliers."
8,Tesla.pdf,We strive to create an environment where people love to come to work every day.
8,Tesla.pdf,"With over 100,000  employees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, we re-doubled our efforts to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be  reported."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While our goal is always prevention, reported complaints of discrimination and harassment are  promptly investigated and if substantiated, subject to discipline up to and including termination."
8,Tesla.pdf,New  employees receive anti-harassment and discrimination training during orientation.
8,Tesla.pdf,A new employee guidebook  was also rolled out which instructs employees to report all forms of misconduct without concern.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers per year, educating our workforce is a top  priority and an ongoing process."
8,Tesla.pdf,We believe it’s essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment where all  employees can achieve their potential.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As a result, we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any  mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations."
8,Tesla.pdf,Below are some of the actions we are  taking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Training: Code of Business Ethics and harassment & discrimination training for front-line leaders, HR partners  and other employees to understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess situations sooner  and escalate appropriately."
8,Tesla.pdf,Internal Tracking System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows HR to  document all employee concerns that are raised to ensure there is follow through and resolution for tracking  purposes.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent them from becoming bigger issues."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The case management system also allows the appropriate teams to review data to trend and issue spot, which  then can lead to proactive solutions before concerns arise."
8,Tesla.pdf,Internal Mobility: A program that advocates for and provides equal access to employee advancement  opportunities and retention with eligibility for opportunities based on standardized performance reviews.

8,Tesla.pdf,"To promote engagement, we lead initiatives driven by employee feedback."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Throughout the year, we use  roundtables, engagement surveys and other feedback forms to gather data and better understand the  employee experience."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our team uses this data to inform our communication strategies.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition to a monthly newsletter emailed to  all U.S. employees and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company-wide internal  news platform with weekly updates on company news, employee recognition and events."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We highlight business, people and safety updates via both email and an expansive network of video screens."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In  2021, we also produced two live and virtual companywide all-hands."

8,Tesla.pdf,"In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits  containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When  paired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants  can assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Along with Starlink Terminals used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the  Ukranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military trucks."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The kit can begin providing  power almost instantly, without any tools or technical experience required."
8,Tesla.pdf,"With the Powerwall kit alone, a user  can power Starlink for five days."
8,Tesla.pdf,"With solar panels installed and operational, the kits can provide indefinite  power for Starlink Terminal, plus a small appliance or laptop."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia and  Hungary to support those impacted by the recent events."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Within hours of implementation, Tesla emailed local  owners announcing that several Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by Tesla and non-Tesla  electric vehicles, free-of-charge."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Tesla worked with NGO partners such as the Footprint Project, and certified  installers in the New Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives, Posigen) to deploy Powerwall and solar panel disaster  relief systems."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a  warehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs."
8,Tesla.pdf,Most systems stayed in place for six weeks  while the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back  up the systems remained in place for substantially longer.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our partners estimate that these systems provided  power to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders."
8,Tesla.pdf,"After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton,  Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project."
8,Tesla.pdf,These systems helped power communications trailers and  mobile offices for over 50 recovery workers.
8,Tesla.pdf,They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are  exploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days  affecting thousands of residents."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services,  Inc., a non-profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to  communities across Texas."
8,Tesla.pdf,The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of  batteries and 40kW of power).
8,Tesla.pdf,"With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities,  enabling it to resume housing and other social services to children."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We were able to  improve our performance in Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts in  Tesla – our own employees."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We evolved the way we define safety, developed internal tools to drive execution,  actively sought worker improvement suggestions and established a more structured EHS&S audit program to  identify safeguards and drive operational excellence throughout all areas of the business."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As we grew and evolved as an EHS&S organization, so did our view of safety."
8,Tesla.pdf,The Human and Organizational  Performance (HOP) and Operational Learning group was developed in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety  into the organization.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In an ever-changing and dynamic work environment, we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to  fail safely."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised of three components: 
1."
8,Tesla.pdf,Engaged workers: workers who are connected to and care about the work they do.
8,Tesla.pdf,"When workers are  engaged, they are more likely to identify and communicate vulnerabilities in the system."
8,Tesla.pdf,2.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Agility: the ability to continuously navigate and adapt in an ever-changing, complex and dynamic work  environment."
8,Tesla.pdf,3.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Safeguards: the hardware, software and human actions that directly prevent an event or mitigate a bad  outcome."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Instead of defining safety as the absence of accidents, we define safety as the presence of capacity."
8,Tesla.pdf,Capacity  can be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes and reduce system brittleness.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to build capacity and allow our workers to fail safely, we needed a more dynamic approach to how we  collect and manage data that allows us to make decisions that reduce risk."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In response to that need, we  developed an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the  intake and visualization of data globally."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better  manage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested  by our employees."
8,Tesla.pdf,Foremost in this effort was our improvement suggestion module — Take Charge.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Combined with Action Tracker,  this module allows workers to submit improvement suggestions in various categories, including environment,  health, safety, security, people and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors and other work groups to  identify and implement solutions to improve the presence of safeguards."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Leading the way with Take Charge submissions is Sherry Ihrig, with over 1,800 improvement suggestions to  safety, processes, cost-savings and more since the program’s start in early 2021."
8,Tesla.pdf,"“Tesla promotes the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’ and the Take Charge program truly  empowers me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,” Ihrig said."
8,Tesla.pdf,"“The Take Charge program encourages associates to increase their awareness of the work environment,” Ihrig said."
8,Tesla.pdf,"“When these and other potential safety hazards are noticed and resolved, it allows associates to improve  their overall work performance.” 
While Ihrig has enjoyed many parts of her experience at Tesla, from teaming up with “hardworking, outgoing  individuals” to learning how to operate a fire extinguisher in emergency response training, the most exciting  part has been the Take Charge program."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Engaged employees like Sherry help Tesla build capacity to ensure safeguards are in place and functioning, so  that when we fail, we fail safely."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2019 and the subsequent variants, we have proactively protected our  workers."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Teams have contributed to country, state and local regulations to ensure the voice of industry was  represented in the drafting and implementation of policies."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our pandemic management team continues to engage with employees at all levels.
8,Tesla.pdf,We consistently re-examine  operations through risk assessments as a key element for managing the ever-changing COVID-19 work  environment.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our dedicated Infectious Disease Team aggressively monitors on-going changes across the world  to stay healthy and compliant with the differences in localities.
8,Tesla.pdf,"• Conducted 59 free, on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics • Administered 14,811 COVID-19 vaccinations • Received vaccination and booster information from 48% of employees using our internal tracking system,  helping monitor progress • Gifted employees $86,500 in cash and prizes to encourage vaccinations 
We established the Compliance Audit Program in 2021 to provide an objective assessment of the management  of EHS&S risk at a site level throughout the various businesses."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We have conducted 31 audits so far that: 
• Focused on compliance with Tesla EHS&S standards and regulatory requirements • Engaged site-level EHS&S professionals to audit other Tesla sites, maximizing technical knowledge across the  businesses • Identified best practices that can be replicated across other sites • Provided guidance and assistance to sites addressing and closing out corrective and preventive actions 
The audit outcomes provided opportunities for workers to identify and employ improvement solutions, adjust  to the changing work environment where necessary, verify and validate existing safeguards, and implement new  safeguards and improve our overall capacity."
8,Tesla.pdf,Gigafactory Nevada became the first Tesla site to have a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) application  accepted.
8,Tesla.pdf,VPP is an OSHA program that recognizes employers in the private industry who have implemented  effective safety and health management systems and maintain injury and illness rates below national Bureau of  Labor Statistics averages for their respective industries.
8,Tesla.pdf,Next step will be a rigorous onsite evaluation by a team  of health and safety professionals in May 2022.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Security of our people, the planet, our property and products continues to be a core factor to enable  production execution and build capacity throughout our entire organization."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our manufacturing locations have dedicated physical and technical security teams, while at our service centers  and remote sites, we augment physical security with our SHIELD ambassadors."
8,Tesla.pdf,"SHIELD is Tesla's Security  Ambassador project that helps increase security awareness at all Tesla locations, especially those without an  on-site security team."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Tesla SHIELD program is designed to educate individuals with the basic security requirements for their  building, to allow them to present the issues to their site manager for resolution and be able to escalate larger  issues to the Security Team for support."
8,Tesla.pdf,"• 271 Security SHIELD Ambassadors registered at 176 locations across 24 countries to help support on-site  security needs • 37,154 workers trained in basic security and awareness courses"
8,Tesla.pdf,"As we continue to increase production, our focus remains on maintaining positive safety records."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We examine  our safety data to identify emerging risks, comparable events for innovative solutions and to better understand  how we can systematically improve across our highest risk areas to help keep our people, the planet, our  products and property safe."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We have turned our attention away from traditional OSHA metrics, but we continue to maintain information on  them for regulatory purposes."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We use these metrics, amongst many others, to examine how how we can see the  results of our commitment to safety."
8,Tesla.pdf,This will be the last year that we present recordable injuries per car produced – which captures all injuries and  illness regardless of their severity or relation to work.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Instead, we will use the American Society for Testing and  Materials (ASTM) standard E2920-19."
8,Tesla.pdf,"ASTM better represents our global reach and more clearly illuminates  serious injuries and illnesses, allowing our focus to remain on preventing and mitigating outcomes of our  highest-risk activities."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As our manufacturing footprint expanded into Austin and Berlin, and our Shanghai location accelerated  production, Fremont continued with the unwavering manufacturing of all Tesla cars."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Fremont Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate has remained below the North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) average for automobile manufacturing for the previous three years and continues  to drive performance through the integration of safety in design and the verification and validation of  safeguards."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to concentrate on the events that matter most, we have made great efforts to increase our focus on  events of significant consequence."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We continue to track and report on OSHA statistics for our U.S.-based sites,  such as DART rates for more serious injuries/illnesses, but we are shifting our view to be more forward thinking  and globally inclusive."
8,Tesla.pdf,We transitioned to the ASTM standard E2920-19 as our global metric in 2020 to better reflect our global  presence and have an increased focus on serious injuries and illnesses.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Other automakers have not yet adopted  this standard, so we are benchmarking against other manufacturing and service industries."
8,Tesla.pdf,We made this  change in response to studies indicating the statistical invalidity of previous metrics (Total Recordable Injury  Rate [TRIR]) as measures of safety outcomes.
8,Tesla.pdf,We continue to concentrate our prevention and mitigation efforts in our highest risk areas across all lines of  business and are accelerating forward with our strategies to ensure essential safeguards are in place and  functioning.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2020, COVID–19 impacted our operations including the shutdown of the Fremont Factory;  therefore, we are using 2021 as our baseline year."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Sadly in 2021, Tesla experienced a fatality which occurred during a vehicle test drive outside of the U.S.  Extensive global actions have been implemented based on our operational learning including limiting speeds  and designated test drive routes."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, we kicked off our Constructing Our Future initiative that focused on empowering our project teams and  partners to accelerate contractor onboarding as well as to simplify our requirements to ensure work is  conducted safely and effectively."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Rather than uploading a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) completed off-site, contractors and suppliers are now  expected to meet a Tesla Responsible Person and EHS&S professional at the location of work to complete a  Pre-Work Risk Assessment."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Over 5,000 companies were onboarded, and 587 Tesla Responsible Persons (TRP) and Contractor Responsible  Persons (CRP) were trained in the new process."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This level of involvement resulted in increased contractor  responsibility, improved communication and more thorough Pre-Work Risk Assessments, which identified  critical and high-risk activities."
8,Tesla.pdf,Shifting from a hazard-based approach to a risk-based approach provides a better opportunity for EHS&S  success by discussing critical and high-risk operations.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, we support the Constructing Our Future with written procedures, training resources and forms  which are easily accessible to Tesla stakeholders."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This strategic approach helps us create the framework  necessary to build safely, efficiently and consistently."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are on schedule to release the new and improved supplier and contractor onboarding and management  system, Workforce Management, in the second quarter of 2022."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This simple, scalable, centralized system will  build on the efficiencies of the interim onboarding process and provide better visibility for managers and  engineers to track performance."
8,Tesla.pdf,The biggest environmental impact is achieved through early displacement of ICE vehicles and replacing them  with EVs.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, we want to displace fossil-based energy generation with renewable energy generation."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0  Gigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt-hours (TWhs) of emissions-free  electricity."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used  to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our  vehicles in that same period combined."
8,Tesla.pdf,We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation.
8,Tesla.pdf,It is our goal to eventually  have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, we  are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to  meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Introduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions and use-phase emissions of our vehicles 
In this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased  electricity, heat, etc."
8,Tesla.pdf,for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations.
8,Tesla.pdf,This information is not only  important to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track  progress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While the most important work we can do  to reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to  reducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This is not only the right thing to do, but it also  makes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes."
8,Tesla.pdf,"It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs – this is economically unfeasible for ICE  vehicles 
We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE)  vehicles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla  produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This becomes more  pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the  entire lifecycle — from raw materials to use-phase emissions to disposal — and not just at vehicle usage  emissions."
8,Tesla.pdf,"• Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (both of which overestimate fuel-economy and underestimate  emissions) rather than real-world data 
The manufacturing process of Model 3 and Model Y currently results  in slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion  engine vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, based on the global weighted average grid  mix, Model 3 and Model Y have lower lifetime emissions than an  equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Lifetime CO2e emitted by an average internal combustion engine  vehicle (model year 2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase,  excluding CO2e emitted during the oil refining phase."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real-world fuel consumption or electricity  consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use-phase of the lifecycle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Various efficiency testing cycles such  as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real-world fuel or energy consumption."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Therefore, we used:  
EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and  Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process."
8,Tesla.pdf,"ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid-size premium  sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This translates to over 400 grams of CO2e per mile once we account for  emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year 
Based on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly  less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its  fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly."
8,Tesla.pdf,"On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs  has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Below, we show zero- emission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Even without factoring in any  changes to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current  trends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time."
8,Tesla.pdf,1NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 22021-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts.
8,Tesla.pdf,Conservatively assumes no change in federal policy or acceleration of move to renewables in the  U.S. for electricity generation.
8,Tesla.pdf,"This includes emissions from upstream supply chain, direct emissions from manufacturing and electricity  consumption and use-phase emissions when charged from a grid with a generation mix that reflects the  geographic distribution of Model 3 and Model Y deliveries in the U.S., Europe and China."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Below are the lifecycle  emissions scenarios we show, and the assumptions used in each of the charts on the following pages: 
Average Premium ICE: The reference ICE vehicle is based on an average of mid-size premium sedans and mid- size premium crossover SUVs, with a real-world fuel economy of 24.3 MPG."
8,Tesla.pdf,Model 3/Y* Personal Use (Grid Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were principally  charged at home from the grid.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Model 3/Y Ridesharing Use (Grid Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for  ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from Tesla energy products, charged from the grid."
8,Tesla.pdf,Model 3/Y Personal Use (Solar Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were principally  charged at home using a solar system and energy storage.
8,Tesla.pdf,Model 3/Y Ridesharing Use (Solar Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for  ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from our energy products and if it were only charged  using a solar system and energy storage.
8,Tesla.pdf,• Charging a Model 3/Y using solar panels and a Powerwall adds emissions to the manufacturing phase while  reducing use-phase emissions to as low as zero when 100% of charging is done using that system.
8,Tesla.pdf,• We conservatively assume no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle  given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve is still very much up for debate.
8,Tesla.pdf,"• Manufacturing phase emissions for Model 3/Y in the U.S. represent a Fremont-made vehicle, while  manufacturing phase emissions in Europe and China represent a China-made vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,* This year we have added the impact of Model Y to the emissions per mile calculation in our LCA.
8,Tesla.pdf,Given that Model 3 and Model Y have 70%+  parts commonality and share many manufacturing processes their GHG footprints are very similar.
8,Tesla.pdf,We have decided to present the LCA as a  weighted average of Model 3 and Model Y based on production share for each vehicle (for manufacturing phase emissions) and delivery volumes  in each region (for use-phase emissions).
8,Tesla.pdf,"To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York-based Tesla vehicle equates to  the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 109 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Even  when charging a Tesla in Michigan, where approximately 60% of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the  emissions from our vehicles still equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with 52 real-world MPG  (considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to  generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further."
8,Tesla.pdf,"EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy  storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an  EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar Roof and Powerwall  manufacturing and upstream supply chain."
8,Tesla.pdf,"A cleaner grid in Europe means a bigger emissions gap between Model 3 and a comparable ICE vehicle 
In Europe, the U.K. and EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), larger portions of energy  generation come from either renewable sources or nuclear, which means that in Europe the use-phase emissions  gap between ICEs and EVs is even wider than it is in the U.S. 
On the other hand, since an average European driver covers fewer miles per year than a U.S. driver, emissions  from the manufacturing phase are divided by fewer miles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While in the U.S., an average vehicle covers 200,000  miles before getting scrapped, in Europe, total mileage is closer to 150,000 miles."
8,Tesla.pdf,We used Austria as an example of how use-phase emissions should evolve once the European grid becomes  greener.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As seen in the chart on the right, in Austria, all-in lifecycle emissions of a personal, grid-charged Model  3Y are over 3.5x lower than all-in lifecycle emissions of an equivalent ICE vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In China, much of the grid is powered by coal."
8,Tesla.pdf,"That said, even in this scenario, charging a Tesla Model 3Y from  the grid is still less emission intensive than running an ICE vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Just like in Europe, we have assumed a  vehicle lifetime of 150,000 miles."
8,Tesla.pdf,We are expecting the grid mix in China to improve dramatically over time as China remains a dominant deployer  and manufacturer of renewable energy.
8,Tesla.pdf,Sichuan Province (with a population of 81 million) is a great example of  this.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration, charging an EV from the grid  is less polluting than charging an EV in most global countries or states."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla Model 3Y in any of our major markets is more environmentally  friendly than burning gasoline."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Considering that vehicles are used for 17 to 20 years before getting scrapped, it  is reasonable to assume that in the coming years, the gap in emissions per mile between EVs and ICEs will only  get wider."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla vehicles are among the most efficient EVs built to date.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In the early days of Model S production, we were  able to achieve energy efficiency of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Model Y All-Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles  / kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date."
8,Tesla.pdf,The gap between Tesla AWD vehicle  efficiency continues to stand out compared to competitors in the same segment.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While achieving the best-in- class energy efficiency, our AWD models can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model Y) and  reach a top speed of 145 mph (135 mph for Model Y)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to  achieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part."
8,Tesla.pdf,The energy efficiency of Tesla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain  efficiency.
8,Tesla.pdf,"It is also reasonable to assume that our high-mileage products, such as our future Tesla Robotaxis,  will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration and top speed become less relevant."
8,Tesla.pdf,This will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven.
8,Tesla.pdf,Building a factory from the ground up with sustainability in mind can have a material impact on reducing energy  use.
8,Tesla.pdf,"For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the  vehicle production process, energy consumption declines."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In our quest for constant improvement, we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the  previous one."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For example, at Gigafactory Texas, we chose highly efficient, insulated, low emissivity windows to  reduce building heating and cooling demand."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, waste heat recovery from our compressors alone will  offset over 1 MW of natural gas consumption for process heating."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While we have already completed substantial  improvements at Gigafactory Shanghai, further improvements will continue at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg  and Gigafactory Texas."
8,Tesla.pdf,All our new factories are designed to be covered with solar panels.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As of the end of 2021, we had installed solar  panels with a capacity of 21,405 kW, with the vast majority installed on the roofs of Gigafactory Nevada,  Gigafactory New York and our manufacturing facilities in California."
8,Tesla.pdf,We will continue to add more capacity to  these and other facilities as space allows and as is economically feasible.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are leveraging six years of sensor data from Gigafactory Nevada to train an artificial intelligence (AI)  program to safely control 195 interconnected HVAC units, accounting for 6MW of total electrical load."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In its first  full year of operation, we have measured significant load reduction compared to baseline usage."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For such  comparison, we look at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two modes under the same conditions  (operations in the factory, time of year, external temperature, etc.)."
8,Tesla.pdf,AI control is expected to achieve significant  energy savings for Tesla as it is scaled up to control a majority share of HVAC equipment at Gigafactory Nevada  as well as HVAC equipment at other Gigafactories.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We will not be content until all our factories are carbon neutral, and there are other projects that we are  working on to further reduce emissions."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, we also need  to use less energy to produce them."
8,Tesla.pdf,Many of the projects created to achieve this goal were showcased at our  Battery Day presentation in September 2020.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Tesla’s 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode  process."
8,Tesla.pdf,Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and  using massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell  production consumes a lot of energy."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The new dry-electrode process allows for the direct transition from a  cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing  phase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations,  whether it is at our factories, sales, service or delivery locations or through our Supercharger network."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla’s battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after  approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Creating a battery that  could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven  for high-mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks."
8,Tesla.pdf,Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission.
8,Tesla.pdf,All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles  every year.
8,Tesla.pdf,"A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a  disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions."
8,Tesla.pdf,"A single  future Tesla vehicle with a million-mile battery could be utilized over five-times more than an average vehicle in  the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its  materials used in a brand-new battery."
8,Tesla.pdf,Note: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Retention figures at lower mileages above likely  reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high-utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age."
8,Tesla.pdf,Performance of newer chemistries (not yet shown here) can vary and we plan to expand disclosure once we have sufficient data.
8,Tesla.pdf,We can make the biggest impact on GHG emissions by selling as many of our products as possible.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Undoubtedly, the use-phase of our products avoids more lifetime emissions than either our operations or our  supply chain could."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, in support of our mission, we track and try to minimize emissions that result from  our full value chain, including our supply chain, manufacturing processes as well as our sales, service and  delivery activities."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, we began measuring our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions considering the principles and guidance  of the GHG Protocol."
8,Tesla.pdf,We used the operational control approach methodology – accounting for GHG emissions  from operations under our control.
8,Tesla.pdf,"For detailed information on the scope of our calculations, please see page  139-142 of this report."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions may increase on an absolute basis in the near term as we  continue to open new factories, our goal is to reduce the emissions intensity from production as we push the  boundaries of sustainable manufacturing and improve the efficiency of our operations."
8,Tesla.pdf,As part of our  commitment to reducing our overall emissions in the long term we signed up for the Science-Based Target  Initiative (SBTi) in 2021.
8,Tesla.pdf,"1 SSD = Sales, Service & Delivery 2 Other includes sites that conduct research & development, administration, energy product warehousing and deployment, and other mixed-used  warehousing."
8,Tesla.pdf,*PwC performed an attest review engagement on this metric.
8,Tesla.pdf,See their report on page 138.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Scope 3 GHG emissions calculations are highly academic, even those widely used and accepted like the GHG  Protocol."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Therefore,  most Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting is done using lofty assumptions as well as estimates from databases – this can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla has begun to measure the two  largest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and  storage products — we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures  and can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match.
8,Tesla.pdf,This also means that we can calculate our use  of product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle  because we have primary data.
8,Tesla.pdf,Prioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy  and emissions data for us to report on.
8,Tesla.pdf,We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our  supply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions — see  the Supply Chain section for more detail.
8,Tesla.pdf,The good thing for us is that Tesla’s high level of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean  we are positioned to manage upstream emissions better than most.
8,Tesla.pdf,Efficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve throughout its lifetime.
8,Tesla.pdf,EVs will get cleaner over their lifetime as  the grid becomes greener.
8,Tesla.pdf,We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their  emissions beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the  grid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The global Supercharger network was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources and annual renewable matching."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, all home charging in California was 100% renewable  through annual renewable matching."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Therefore, the only emissions from the use of Tesla vehicles were a result of  home charging outside of California and use of third-party charging networks."
8,Tesla.pdf,"According to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with  the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes  over eight million premature deaths annually."
8,Tesla.pdf,That is double the previous estimate of deaths from the negative  effects of fine-particle pollution and would account for one-in-five premature deaths worldwide.
8,Tesla.pdf,This is a major  advantage of EVs that is often forgotten about as the overall EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse gases.
8,Tesla.pdf,"EVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very much about addressing preventable deaths today."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While air-quality is often categorized as a problem in developing countries, Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and other  PM2.5 particulates* cause significant issues in developed countries as well."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In Europe alone, almost 800,000  people die prematurely every year due to pollution-related illnesses."
8,Tesla.pdf,"EVs not only reduce the world's total  carbon footprint, but also help to reduce city pollution."
8,Tesla.pdf,Combination trucks – of which the vast majority are semi trucks – in the U.S. account for just 1.1% of the total  fleet of vehicles on the road.
8,Tesla.pdf,"That said, because combination trucks have high fuel consumption due to their  weight and heavy utilization, they account for approximately 18% of all U.S. vehicle emissions."
8,Tesla.pdf,Electrifying the  heavy-duty truck segment is an essential part of transitioning the world to sustainable energy.
8,Tesla.pdf,With both the U.S. and E.U.
8,Tesla.pdf,"having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect  the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to  be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000  pounds)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When fully loaded, the Tesla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through  aerodynamics and highly efficient motors."
8,Tesla.pdf,This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per  kWh.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long-distance hauling to also be  sustainable."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S.  and Europe, where each Tesla Semi could top up their range."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s  transition to sustainable energy.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Right now, cell availability is  the limiting factor for production – a Tesla Semi requires  multiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Waste Generated Per Vehicle Manufactured As we build more efficient factories, our waste per vehicle decreases 
Building localized factories both makes sense economically and reduces waste."
8,Tesla.pdf,"First, because the automotive  supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be  shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Trailer entry points surround the whole factory,  which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Less  material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging."
8,Tesla.pdf,The chart  below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S.  We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas to  continue the same trend.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The vast majority of generated waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable."
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Gigafactory Shanghai,  for example, just 7% of total waste generated in 2021 was not recyclable."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We push for innovative approaches to reducing waste, which includes reduction of non-recyclable materials in  the first place, learning from local factories and deploying improvements globally or working with our logistics  team to minimize shipments and packaging per vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"• Global Vehicle Manufacturing = all major factories dedicated to vehicle manufacturing, including the Fremont Factory and supporting facilities, Gigafactory Nevada and  Gigafactory Shanghai."
8,Tesla.pdf,"• Legacy Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Nevada, Fremont Factory and supporting facilities."
8,Tesla.pdf,• New Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Shanghai.
8,Tesla.pdf,There is a misconception that producing an EV requires more water than producing an ICE vehicle.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our data  shows this is not the case.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on  how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water  at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established  carmakers."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Furthermore, the efficient manufacturing design we are implementing at our new factories in Texas  and Berlin-Brandenburg will result in further reductions in our water usage per vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our goal is to have  industry-leading low water usage per vehicle, even when accounting for cell manufacturing."
8,Tesla.pdf,The below chart  includes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While many recognize the impact that power generation has on GHG emissions, its impact on water  consumption is less appreciated."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S.,  as water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam-driven turbine generators and to  cool power-producing equipment."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This means that every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced  not only lowers GHG emissions, but also lowers water consumption."
8,Tesla.pdf,*Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design.
8,Tesla.pdf,Actual production figures will not be known until factories are ramped to full production  speed.
8,Tesla.pdf,Water is becoming increasingly scarce as the climate changes.
8,Tesla.pdf,That is why we are reducing our water usage  throughout our operations as much as possible.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will  continue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery."
8,Tesla.pdf,The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint  operations.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly."
8,Tesla.pdf,The total cooling  tower makeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater.
8,Tesla.pdf,These are some  of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce  water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells).
8,Tesla.pdf,1.
8,Tesla.pdf,Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by  optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade  rinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing."
8,Tesla.pdf,2.
8,Tesla.pdf,Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1  million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas.
8,Tesla.pdf,Rainwater will be  recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In an average year, such systems should save an  estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water  condenses out of the air."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater."
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse  this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water."
8,Tesla.pdf,3.
8,Tesla.pdf,Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting  the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Gigafactory Texas, this could  result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually."
8,Tesla.pdf,Reclaimed water is available  and under investigation for use at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.

8,Tesla.pdf,Emissions credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non-polluting  products by allowing them to sell their credits to polluting companies.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to meet various countries’  emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non-polluting companies through credit  purchases."
8,Tesla.pdf,The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves  become non-polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for  their non-polluting credits.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero-emission regulatory credits to other OEMs."
8,Tesla.pdf,Proceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace  ICE vehicles.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other  companies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to meet  increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive  EVs."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, Tesla delivered almost 1 million EVs globally."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We hope that every car manufacturer will strive to produce  hundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reduction of emissions will only be achieved if all  carmakers push for an industry-wide shift to EVs."
8,Tesla.pdf,Source: EV-volumes.com; Micro-cars not included.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla data are production volumes; other OEMs sales and  delivery volumes are assumed to approximate their production for the year.
8,Tesla.pdf,Consumers are unlikely to buy products only because they have a low lifetime carbon footprint.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to  convince consumers to buy our products, they need to be better in every way – performance, cost of ownership,  safety, fun and more."
8,Tesla.pdf,We want to make products that people love.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Model 3 is the first EV in history priced competitively with its gas-powered equivalents, even before taking into  consideration any regional subsidies and lower running costs."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Unfortunately, most other EVs on the market  today are often priced at over a $10,000 premium compared to their direct ICE vehicle equivalents."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla’s ability to achieve our mission rests first and foremost on our products.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We are not just trying to build the  best electric cars, we are striving to build the best cars, period."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our focus from the beginning has been to  develop products that are not only sustainable, but also superior to fossil-fuel alternatives in every way."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Many  incorrectly believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or  performance, but Tesla vehicles combine performance, safety, efficiency and competitive prices."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Similarly,  Tesla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and remote communities with reliable,  affordable energy."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Over 5 years of average driving, the ownership costs of a Tesla Model 3 are closer to a Camry than a 3 Series 
The accessibility of our products is fundamental to our mission."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to  an equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be  considered."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance  costs, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained  exceptionally strong since our initial launch."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series,  but the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s best-selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*."
8,Tesla.pdf,The advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real-world data  rather than only being able to use estimates.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost  of repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, the insurance cost for the Model 3 RWD below is based on  the projected median insurance rate in the U.S. for Tesla Model 3 drivers."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our analysis shows that over five years  and 60,000 miles, running a Model 3 RWD costs 63 cents per mile."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Notably, running costs such as fuel (electricity or gasoline), maintenance, tires and repairs for Model 3 should  cost just over half of a mass-market ICE vehicle such as a Toyota Camry."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For an EV to have an impact on the environment, it must be genuinely displacing internal combustion engine  miles, rather than sitting in the driveway as a secondary car used for errands or short trips only."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our data shows  that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally  being used as a customer’s primary vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose  between price, quality, usability and sustainability."
8,Tesla.pdf,"An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers  don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"There is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary-use vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less  they will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle."
8,Tesla.pdf,Surveys consistently indicate that the real or  perceived lack of EV range is the key reason why many people do not consider replacing their ICE vehicle with  an EV.
8,Tesla.pdf,Freedom of travel is the reason people buy vehicles in the first place.
8,Tesla.pdf,"To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles  with EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While most personal  vehicle journeys are relatively short, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can  meet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets all their driving needs."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405  miles of range for the long-range version."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our focus on energy efficiency — achieving superior range from the  same size battery — has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively  stable.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla customers do."
8,Tesla.pdf,"After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare."
8,Tesla.pdf,Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At that stage, drivers  are often likely to take a break."
8,Tesla.pdf,We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before  continuing the journey.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15  minutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While coverage  is important, uptime is essential."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near- empty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021 alone, we opened 912 new  Supercharger locations around the world for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations with over 31,000 plugs."
8,Tesla.pdf,1Uptime of Supercharger sites reflects the average percentage of sites globally that had at least 50% daily capacity functional for the year.
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Tesla, safety features are not optional."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle.
8,Tesla.pdf,"When we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe."
8,Tesla.pdf,This section of the Impact Report will  detail our key efforts on the Vehicle Safety front.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition to designing and building cars with the highest levels of real-world safety, we've also been working  on ways to help our customers drive as safely as possible."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Through our Tesla Insurance program, we do just this  by providing real time feedback to customers and incentives for safe driving such as reductions in monthly  insurance premiums."
8,Tesla.pdf,Customers who choose to be a part of this program receive a Safety ScoreBeta.
8,Tesla.pdf,This score changes based on  driving behavior and the insurance premium changes with it.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Instead of determining a driver’s insurance  premiums from demographic information (gender, age, education, or marital status) and financial history (credit  score), our algorithm calculates Safety ScoreBeta based on actual driver behavior."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The behaviors we monitor are:  
Our data show a lower rate of collision for the cohort of customers who have enabled Safety ScoreBeta."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the  vehicle’s Safety ScoreBeta increases, the number of collisions per mile decreases and insurance premiums reduce."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external  cameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic  Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle-Aware  Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more — all of which continue to improve over time through software  updates."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm: 
When a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Thanks to our eight-camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s  trajectory as well as a stop sign."
8,Tesla.pdf,A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Pressing the accelerator pedal when the circumstances indicate you should be pressing the brake instead, like  when pulling into a parking space, is relatively common no matter what vehicle you're in."
8,Tesla.pdf,"However, if you are in  a Tesla, when our cameras recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication Mitigation” system cuts  torque from the electric motor to prevent a collision if you happen to press hard on the accelerator."
8,Tesla.pdf,This  technology has prevented or mitigated hundreds of collisions every month.
8,Tesla.pdf,"If a driver is changing into a lane while a vehicle in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle  starts departing its lane without an indicator, our vehicles will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a  collision."
8,Tesla.pdf,Many people assume that AEB (Automatic Emergency Breaking) – a system that most new vehicles are  equipped with – works equally well with all vehicles.
8,Tesla.pdf,That’s not the case.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The range of sensors, compute power  and quality of software in the system can vary dramatically."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our active safety features are powered by eight  cameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars."
8,Tesla.pdf,"After the introduction of Tesla Vision (a vision-only system that excludes radar), our active safety ratings with  IIHS improved."
8,Tesla.pdf,Pedestrian AEB performance of our Tesla Vision was over 45% better than performance of vision  + radar.
8,Tesla.pdf,It is no surprise that the active safety score achieved by Tesla Model 3 Euro NCAP remains an outlier.

8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot  technology (Autosteer and active safety features)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no  Autosteer and active safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven."
8,Tesla.pdf,"By comparison,  NHTSA’s most recent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million  miles driven."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For the latest quarterly accident data related to our vehicles and a description of our methodology used to collect accident data, please view  our Vehicle Safety Report."
8,Tesla.pdf,*Based on NHTSA’s most recent crash data.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla strives to go beyond industry standard testing by using real-world data from our fleet of over two millions  cars on the road.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Historically, the aim of manufacturers has been to design their vehicles to perform well for a  suite of regulatory and consumer tests."
8,Tesla.pdf,There are too many common impact scenarios (visible in the heatmap  below) that are simply not covered by regulatory crash tests.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The richness of data we are collecting enables us  to develop safety in all scenarios, not only the ones covered by regulation and ratings."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We analyze data from our fleet to find solutions, which we then update via over-the-air software updates."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our  algorithm uses vehicle sensor data and, within tens of milli-seconds of impact, determines what type of impact  has occurred and triggers the seatbelt pretensioners and airbags to respond in the most optimal way down to  the millimeter and mile per hour."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla engineers are also in the final stages of evaluating a system which uses  Autopilot to identify when a crash is imminent.
8,Tesla.pdf,This gives Tesla vehicles an uncanny ability to predict potential  collisions and respond faster to an impact when it does occur.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We use field data, data analytics and simulations to inform our design and safety engineers’ work on future  products and to send software improvements to our existing fleet via over-the-air updates."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla is also sharing  data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations — in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access  to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world.
8,Tesla.pdf,"This access to data will accelerate  impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles  to protect lives."
8,Tesla.pdf,"After we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of  the system once it is deployed in the real world."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since deployment of our ‘offzone’ side algorithm (data-driven  safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our  new algorithm in these new modes."
8,Tesla.pdf,This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet-based  learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side  collision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision."
8,Tesla.pdf,And side sensors are usually too close to a  driver window to detect a collision far in the front.
8,Tesla.pdf,We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that  they can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary.
8,Tesla.pdf,Improving occupant safety has always been key to our mission.
8,Tesla.pdf,All our vehicles are built off a safety-first  architecture with a low center of gravity (thanks to the positioning of our battery) and enhanced frontal impact  safety (thanks to the front trunk that is void of the engine found in forward engine ICE vehicles).
8,Tesla.pdf,"Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 and Model Y to be some  of the safest cars built to date, anywhere."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Even though Model 3 and Model Y have no engine, their performance  is similar to a “mid-engine internal combustion car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear  motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Not only does this architecture add to the  overall agility and handling of the car, but it also improves stability control effectiveness by minimizing  rotational kinetic energy."
8,Tesla.pdf,"After putting Model 3 and Model Y through a series of crash tests used as part of the New Car Assessment  Program to calculate the likelihood of serious bodily injury for front, side and rollover crashes, the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded each top safety ratings of 5-stars in every category  and subcategory."
8,Tesla.pdf,A hallmark of Tesla ownership is connectivity.
8,Tesla.pdf,We are an industry leader in deploying over-the-air (OTA)  software updates to our vehicles.
8,Tesla.pdf,"These updates are integral to – and continuously enhance – the customer  experience, and they can include improvements to customer safety or a remedy to a recall."
8,Tesla.pdf,OTA updates can be  installed at a customer’s convenience without a trip to a Tesla Service Center.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Furthermore, all of Tesla’s safety features come standard  with every vehicle and our ratings are based on our standard safety equipment."
8,Tesla.pdf,"At Tesla, we do not believe that safety should be optional."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When the media reports a story about a vehicle fire, it is usually reporting on an EV fire."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This is likely a result of  chasing clicks, rather than the prevalence of EV-related fires compared to ICE vehicle-related fires."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The reality is,  when compared to Tesla vehicles, ICE vehicles catch fire at a vastly higher rate."
8,Tesla.pdf,"According to the latest available  data, in 2020, there were almost 173,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone."
8,Tesla.pdf,"From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled."
8,Tesla.pdf,"By  comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation  show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to provide an apt comparison to NFPA data, Tesla’s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused  by structure fires, arson and other reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for some of the Tesla vehicle  fires over this time period."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We continue to improve our battery chemistry, cell structure, battery pack structure and vehicle passive safety  in order to decrease fire risk to as close to zero as possible."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As Tesla’s vehicle technology continues to improve,  fires will be even less likely for our EVs."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla has partnered with European and Australasian NCAPs to provide free mobile app-based emergency  response documentation for quick access to Tesla vehicle specific models.
8,Tesla.pdf,We make detailed information available to first responders so they can safely handle those emergency situations.
8,Tesla.pdf,The beauty of selling commercial storage systems such as Megapack is that purchasing such a product is almost  purely a mathematical decision for our commercial customers.
8,Tesla.pdf,"If installing Megapack makes economic sense,  there is no reason not to install one."
8,Tesla.pdf,"A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage  capacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla Energy continues to be  dependent on the global supply chain, including cell supply."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, in order to meet demand that is well in  excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new production facility capable of  producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year."
8,Tesla.pdf,The best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your reliance on the grid.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla is a one-stop shop for taking our  customers off-grid by covering a large variety of their needs.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage  products, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Some of these projects were massive deployments,  including a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In order to switch  global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need  to increase to ~10,000 GWh."
8,Tesla.pdf,Anyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight  alone."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In Massachusetts,  for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings  within approximately 10 years."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the cost of these products continues to decline, more customers will be  willing to switch to solar and storage purely due to lower overall cost."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Electrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common, predominantly due to weather and natural  disasters."
8,Tesla.pdf,"According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electrical disturbances cost businesses $150 billion per  year."
8,Tesla.pdf,It is not surprising that homeowners and businesses are increasingly turning to backup power supply  options.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our solar and energy storage products are a great way to reduce emissions while also ensuring backup  power during outages.
8,Tesla.pdf,We are continuously working on reducing the cost of our products in order to foster mass adoption.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Ultimately,  using renewable energy (such as solar or wind) with battery storage will become the cheapest energy option  available, regardless of location."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This is already the case in many, but not all, locations around the world."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the  cost continues to decline, more customers will be able to financially benefit from turning to renewable energy."

8,Tesla.pdf,Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla creates our products  from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their  suppliers and sub-suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Though we believe that battery  recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain,  we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to  meet the growing demand for our products."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring  that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our goal is that where  Tesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our  purchases."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives: 
1."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories  (supply chain localization); and   2."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing  communities."
8,Tesla.pdf,Upstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery – from raw material extraction through refining and  transportation of materials – can be meaningful.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of  the total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot analysis – an industry first – is on page 104 of this report.

8,Tesla.pdf,"A common question we receive is: “What happens to Tesla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?”  An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium-ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil  fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium-ion battery are recyclable."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When petroleum is  pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere  that are not recoverable for reuse."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in  the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly."
8,Tesla.pdf,Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the  useful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery  efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a  customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last  many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Most batteries that  Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control."
8,Tesla.pdf,None of our scrapped  lithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal  ecosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers."
8,Tesla.pdf,We actively implement  circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The small number of post-consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles  on the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest  model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some  time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada for in- house processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While Tesla has worked for  years with third-party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the  importance of also building recycling capacity in-house to supplement these relationships."
8,Tesla.pdf,"On-site recycling  brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight  to our nickel and cobalt suppliers."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale,  allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing  of R&D products."
8,Tesla.pdf,"By the end of 2021, this facility achieved a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material  per week."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As the manufacturer of our in-house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to  maximize key battery material recovery."
8,Tesla.pdf,"With the implementation of in-house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally."
8,Tesla.pdf,We  intend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re-introduce valuable materials back into our  manufacturing process.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and  low environmental impact."
8,Tesla.pdf,"From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the  long term as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than  purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing."
8,Tesla.pdf,"A closed-loop battery recycling process presents a  compelling solution to move energy supply away from the  fossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more  circular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over  and over again."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly.
8,Tesla.pdf,We do this by proactively identifying and  addressing potential risks in our supply chains.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and  Responsible Materials Policy outline Tesla’s expectations for suppliers."
8,Tesla.pdf,Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral  Supply Chains.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on- the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The next sections will detail how we undertake each of the five steps laid out above, starting with our  management system approach."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible  sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We prioritize  these raw materials for the following reasons: 
1."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production,  represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle  range and safety performance."
8,Tesla.pdf,2.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ – in that  they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often  concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As known global reserves  are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in  more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified  as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are  essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As a result, the impact of  mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social  scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors."
8,Tesla.pdf,Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to  ensure mining is done in a responsible way.
8,Tesla.pdf,This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible  Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible  mining standards in our due diligence.
8,Tesla.pdf,"The implementation of an OECD-aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following  two pillars: 
1."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing  steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain  are present at mine sites."
8,Tesla.pdf,Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local  contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers  and mining.
8,Tesla.pdf,It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and  social data.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel- containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies."
8,Tesla.pdf,All nine binding  contracts include environmental and social requirements.
8,Tesla.pdf,"As Tesla’s battery supply chain continues to scale,  Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase."
8,Tesla.pdf,2.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the  continuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in Tesla’s supply chain,  informed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum  (NCA) and nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for  lower energy applications."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and  manganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and  provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing."
8,Tesla.pdf,"To put this into context, lithium only  accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no  cobalt or nickel."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade  chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of  responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the  foreseeable future."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these  materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary,  mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term."
8,Tesla.pdf,The availability and affordability of  these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable  energy.
8,Tesla.pdf,We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to  enable the scale up of key battery minerals.
8,Tesla.pdf,"For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of  nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell  performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt."
8,Tesla.pdf,It is important to note that  we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell  production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In the past year, Tesla collected environmental and social data in its cobalt, lithium and nickel supply chains  through the following main activities: 
Audits are an important tool for Tesla to gather environmental and social data for cobalt, nickel and lithium."
8,Tesla.pdf,"• In 2021, 83% of refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain, including 100% of refiners and mine sites from  whom Tesla sources directly, either underwent or committed to undergo independent external sustainability  audits against one of the following sustainability and responsible mining standards: IRMA Standard, the  Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), Towards Sustainable  Mining (TSM) and/or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance Expectations."
8,Tesla.pdf,"• In addition, Tesla conducted six audits in the battery supply chain tailored to Tesla’s specific environmental  and social requirements, including the OECD guidance and environmental management systems."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla also  has an audit program that goes beyond the battery supply chain – please see pages 112 - 115.
8,Tesla.pdf,• Tesla also reviews suppliers’ ISO14001 (environmental management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health  and safety) certification statuses.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s  cobalt, nickel and lithium supply  chains that we directly sourced from  underwent or have committed to  undergo independent third-party  sustainability audits 
Of all refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s  cobalt, nickel and lithium supply  chains underwent, or have committed  to undergo, independent third-party  sustainability audits"
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla used a newly developed Know-Your-Supplier (KYS) Questionnaire to map our battery supply chain and  collect information related to suppliers’ environmental and social management systems.
8,Tesla.pdf,"1 Independent external sustainability assessments included: Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), the Responsible Minerals  Initiative (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), and/or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance  Expectations, Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) 2 This column refers to LCAs conducted by the supplier (not Tesla)."
8,Tesla.pdf,3 There is currently no industry-wide 3rd party audit program for lithium refiners.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In addition to the product-specific LCA described in the Environmental Impact section, Tesla also commissioned  LCA service provider Minviro to identify hotspots with high global warming potential across eight specific  processing routes from which we currently source cobalt, nickel and lithium."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The hotspot analysis found that main drivers of GHG emissions depend on the different battery compositions,  processing routes and countries of origin."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Overall, key drivers are the cathode and anode supply chains."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Within  the cathode supply chain, the hotspots are nickel and lithium, and cobalt was only a minimal contributor."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Within  the cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains, chemical processing (refining / smelting) was a larger driver than  mining."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla complemented the hotspot analysis with data collected during a pilot blockchain traceability project for  nickel sourced from Tesla nickel supplier, BHP, that traced nickel from a mine site in Australia to Tesla and  collected GHG emissions data for every step."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The pilot project showed that mining and upstream processing  had a higher CO2e intensity than precursor, cathode and battery cell production."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Building on this hotspot analysis and pilot project, Tesla developed a data collection methodology aligned with  the GHG Protocol – a globally recognized standard for measuring GHG emissions – and informed by the  European Product Environmental Footprint methodology and the Product Environmental Footprint Category  Rules (PEFCR) guidance for batteries — a set of rules developed by the European Union on calculating product- specific environmental footprint."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Instead of relying on estimates or aggregate data from third parties, Tesla’s  ambition is to collect as much primary data from Tesla’s suppliers as possible to get the most accurate  understanding of GHG emissions hotspots and therefore, how to reduce emissions."
8,Tesla.pdf,Reports and grievances from NGOs and community organizations as well as media articles are other important  sources for potential environmental and social risk information.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla reviews allegations in detail and conducts  its own investigations, including through direct bilateral engagement with relevant suppliers and with the  parties making the allegations, to assess the severity of the risk and possibilities for risk avoidance or corrective  actions."
8,Tesla.pdf,A Tesla delegation including members of Tesla’s Responsible Sourcing Committee visited suppliers in the DRC  and Argentina.
8,Tesla.pdf,Both trips included visits to mine sites and meetings with community representatives.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In the  DRC, Tesla also visited a school, an orphanage and a maternity clinic."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Aside from contributing to Tesla’s  environmental and social risk assessments, the trips helped Tesla better understand local contexts and  challenges."
8,Tesla.pdf,The DRC trip provided a more nuanced view of the complex issue of artisanal and small-scale  mining (ASM) and its history within the DRC.
8,Tesla.pdf,"In Argentina, the trip focused on questions related to water usage  and the use of new technologies to extract lithium in a more energy-efficient way."
8,Tesla.pdf,"From all the activities listed in this section, Tesla identified six risk areas as well as cross-cutting topics in cobalt,  lithium and nickel supply chains for prioritized engagement, described in Step 3, on the next page."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As a result of the activities listed in Step 2, Tesla identified the following focus areas for risk mitigation and  improvement of local conditions at or around cobalt, nickel and lithium mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain: 
Tesla reviewed • A supplier’s occupational health and safety system • A supplier’s digital system to monitor the risk of unavoidable landslides • Evidence of progress towards the elimination of safety-related incidents • Minutes from community meetings to raise awareness around safety risks related to  landslides and trespassing • A supplier’s commitment to conduct a Human Rights Risk and Impact Assessment  (HRRIA) 
Tesla reviewed • Data on water levels and water quality, including environmental surface water monitoring  sheets • Evidence that potential sources for acid leaks were decommissioned or re-engineered • Minutes from community meetings to raise awareness of potential sources of water  pollution and mitigation measures • Written assurance that water is not discharged to water sources for nearby communities 
Tesla also met with community representatives to confirm that a supplier’s usage of  freshwater does not impact communities’ water access."
8,Tesla.pdf,"For another supplier, Tesla participated in the establishment of a committee of independent  environmental experts to assess and work with the supplier on environmental risk  management."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla reviewed • Evidence for a supplier’s government engagement in support of artisanal mine site  legalization • Evidence for investments into initiatives supporting responsible artisanal mining 
Tesla also met with representatives of artisanal mining communities and provided funding to  initiatives supporting responsible artisanal mining (see page 109)."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As a result of the activities listed in Step 2, Tesla identified the following focus areas for risk mitigation and  improvement of local conditions at or around cobalt, nickel and lithium mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain: 
Tesla reviewed • A supplier’s area of operation in relation to nearby forest areas • A supplier’s reforestation and rehabilitation plans • Written assurance that mining activities did not take place in rainforest areas • Environmental impact assessments 
Tesla directly engaged with representatives of communities affected by mining operations to  review that regular engagement and consultation take place and community needs are  responded to."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla also reviewed • Meeting minutes to ensure communities were regularly consulted • Evidence for a best-practice Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process, including  in coordination with responsible government authorities 
Tesla’s approach to GHG emissions data collection (see Graph in Step 2) is currently being  implemented."
8,Tesla.pdf,The data collected will inform the development of concrete actions to reduce  Tesla’s Scope 3 emissions.
8,Tesla.pdf,"• Based on an initial review, 15 refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain disclosed that  they conducted an LCA 
Cross-cutting Across all risk areas identified, Tesla • Reviewed suppliers’ audit frameworks to ensure upcoming audits will cover all areas  identified above • 55 corrective actions agreed to with suppliers related to suppliers’ environmental and  social management processes • Expanded environmental and social requirements in supplier contracts, for example  related to responsible mining standards, LCAs, GHG emissions footprint disclosure, and  transparent and proactive risk disclosure • Developed a formal technical collaboration on sustainability with a supplier"
8,Tesla.pdf,The DRC is an important source of cobalt for Tesla batteries.
8,Tesla.pdf,We will continue supporting sourcing from the  DRC provided our responsible sourcing standards are met.
8,Tesla.pdf,"While Tesla does not source cobalt from Artisanal  and Small-Scale Mining (ASM), we recognize the importance of ASM for local livelihoods."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This is why Tesla  provides funding to, and sits on, the Steering Committee of the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA), a multi-stakeholder  initiative to support the improvement of conditions in communities impacted by artisanal mining through the  following activities: 
• Occupational health and safety awareness raising campaign for mine workers • First aid training for mine workers and selection of safety captains • Distribution of protective equipment to washer women • Creation of savings groups for mining community members paired with financial literacy training • Development of referral system for children engaged in mining activities, including child labor notification  protocol, remediation solution packages, and guidelines for case managers on remediation steps, in  collaboration with the NGO, Save the Children • Trainings related to child rights • Electrification of five schools covering students through the distribution of solar-chargeable portable lamps • A marketplace and football field selected for the placement of lighting poles"
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla understands that many of the environmental and social issues in global EV supply chains do not concern  Tesla, alone."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla is actively engaging in multi-stakeholder forums and industry groups to find industry-wide  solutions to industry-wide questions: 
• Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA): Tesla joined IRMA as a Member in 2021 to support  responsible mining practices and transparent and robust audit processes that emphasize community  interviews."
8,Tesla.pdf,"It is important to Tesla that NGOs and communities actively participate in third-party audits of  mines against the IRMA Standard, as their perspectives provide greater context on mining operations and the  impacts of extraction, while also increasing accountability and identifying opportunities for improvement."
8,Tesla.pdf,• Global Battery Alliance (GBA): Tesla has been involved in the GBA since 2020 and has served on the GBA  Board and Battery Passport Steering Committee since 2021.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla’s goal as part of the GBA is to advocate for  high standards for responsible battery materials sourcing, align with EU regulatory requirements, and  support the development of actionable guidance related to GHG emissions data collection, recycling, and in- country environmental and social projects."
8,Tesla.pdf,• Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI): Tesla is a member of the RMI to support the RMI’s refiner audit  programs and industry-wide responsible sourcing dialogue.
8,Tesla.pdf,• IFC Net Zero Roadmap Working Group: Tesla has participated in the IFC Working Group since early 2022 to  provide a downstream perspective in the development of actionable guidance for mine sites to reduce  carbon emissions.
8,Tesla.pdf,• Re|Source: Tesla participates in the supply chain-wide Re|Source consortium to pilot blockchain-supported  traceability in the cobalt supply chain.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla offers insights from an OEM perspective on metrics critical to  traceability efforts and works with the consortium towards the first end-to-end blockchain-enabled tracing of  cobalt material starting from Tesla’s supplier in the DRC to Gigafactory Shanghai.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla’s battery responsible sourcing program is still relatively new.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Yet, the program has achieved several  important milestones this last year, including the development and initial implementation of a system to identify  environmental and social risks in the battery supply chain and concrete progress towards mitigation and  improving the situation of stakeholders impacted by Tesla’s battery supply chain."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2022, Tesla plans to continue building on momentum of the program and improve on the data points shared  in this report, including the development of supply chain GHG emissions reduction plans and further projects  and investments in mining countries to have a positive environmental and social impact."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Tesla will then explore  an expansion to manganese, graphite, copper and mica."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance  evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business."
8,Tesla.pdf,This program extension  was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company  gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production.
8,Tesla.pdf,"We recognized that this growth came with an  increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased  responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement."
8,Tesla.pdf,"During the program pilot phase, we  focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially  dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts."
8,Tesla.pdf,We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the  basis for our audits.
8,Tesla.pdf,The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and  stringent requirements for supplier completion.
8,Tesla.pdf,"It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety,  environmental, ethical and management system topics."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Audits are conducted by independent third parties that  are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its  implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures  require that suppliers undergo a closure audit."
8,Tesla.pdf,These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit  where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier  audits.
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to  improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once,  representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As part of these audits over 4,000  supplier employee interviews were conducted."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit  program."
8,Tesla.pdf,"While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the  updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When we started our audit  program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai."
8,Tesla.pdf,"We now have six factories across  three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As our global  footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was  an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply  chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base."
8,Tesla.pdf,"The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk  assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location."
8,Tesla.pdf,"This  criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be  nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the  potential to further mitigate risk."
8,Tesla.pdf,"With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50%  of our global spend with our direct supply base."
8,Tesla.pdf,"As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive  way."
8,Tesla.pdf,"When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans  to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In  cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that  their corrective action plans have been fully implemented."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers  are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that  those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any  violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers."
8,Tesla.pdf,"In cases where such  instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be  developed immediately, together with the supplier."
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the  supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable  time frame.
8,Tesla.pdf,Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social  risks within our supply chain.
8,Tesla.pdf,"These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures,  but also sets a baseline for future evaluations."
8,Tesla.pdf,"Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential  risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below."
8,Tesla.pdf,We engaged with several third-party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for  emerging issues that may affect our suppliers.
8,Tesla.pdf,"These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and  environmental degradation."
8,Tesla.pdf,This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as  information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their  plans for correcting the identified risk.
8,Tesla.pdf,Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within  our supply chain.
8,Tesla.pdf,We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing  practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies.

9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our first annual sustainability report, released in January  2021, showed early progress on our commitments to  become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste  company by 2030 and protect ecosystems by building  a Planetary Computer."
9,Microsoft.pdf,2021 was a year of both successes and challenges.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"While we continued to make progress on several of our  goals, with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope  2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased year  over year, due in substantial part to significant global  datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and  usage as a result of the pandemic."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"During our most recent fiscal year, we grew business  revenue by 20 percent while continuing to reduce our  operational emissions, as represented by Scope 1 and 2  combined, with a decrease of approximately 17 percent  through our purchasing of renewable energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"However, as our business has grown and we’ve seen  increased use of our devices and cloud services, our  total Scope 3 emissions (comprising the company’s  entire value chain) have increased by about 23 percent  year-over-year."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"These emissions include, among other  things, the carbon emitted from electricity generation to  power devices at home or at work and for producing the  concrete and steel we use in construction."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We work to limit these emissions when we design and  manufacture our products, and work with our suppliers  to report and reduce their emissions—but still saw an  increase."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This serves as an important reminder that Scope  3 emissions are the most difficult to control and reduce.
9,Microsoft.pdf,This year has highlighted the challenges of reducing  Scope 3 emissions and we’re committed to sharing our  learnings to help other organizations who are wrestling  with these same challenges.
9,Microsoft.pdf,One Scope 3 category that saw an annual increase  was capital equipment.
9,Microsoft.pdf,This category includes the  emissions to produce equipment we bought this year  (and will use for a long time) as well as the carbon  emissions associated with the construction of new  buildings including both datacenters and office space.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"For example, as the Microsoft Cloud business expands,  construction of new datacenters and new server  equipment is needed to support growing customer  demand."
9,Microsoft.pdf,The emissions associated with the capital  equipment category accounted for about 30 percent  of our Scope 3 total this year.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Another Scope 3 category that saw an increase was the  use of our products, specifically the estimated emissions  associated with powering products we sold including  Xbox and Surface devices."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This category accounted for  about 29 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Around the world, the electricity used to power devices  today largely comes from grids reliant on carbon- intensive sources such as coal or gas, so Microsoft must  account for that carbon for the lifetime of our devices  to accurately track our Scope 3 emissions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"And, because  every part of the world has a different mix of electricity  generation sources, we calculate a device’s climate  impact based on where the device was sold."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Despite these Scope 3 increases, we remain dedicated to  building a world better than the one we found, and to  helping our customers and partners achieve the same."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The impact of this work will not all be felt immediately,  and our experience this year highlights a few takeaways  relevant to many organizations executing against their  sustainability commitments."
9,Microsoft.pdf,1.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Progress won’t always be linear.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The rate at which  we can implement emissions reductions is dependent  on many factors that can fluctuate over time, ranging  from our own business growth and supplier mix  to the rate of growth of green infrastructure, such  as the supply of and transition speed to renewable  energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Additionally, different sources of emissions  will be addressed on different time frames as climate  technologies and renewable alternatives advance."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"And as measurement methodologies improve and  new standards emerge, companies like ours may see  emissions rise or fall year-over-year."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Nonetheless, the challenge remains: we must  continuously improve on our efforts to decouple our  emissions from our growth until we reach our carbon  negative commitment in 2030."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Some of this will happen  through the completion of specific goals such as our  shift to a 100 percent electric campus vehicle fleet, our  move away from diesel fuel as a backup energy source  for our datacenters, and the carbon benefits of our  waste reduction improvements due to our expanding  fleet of Circular Centers."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Other progress will happen  through the expansion of our renewable energy  purchasing program to cover the energy consumption  of our consumer devices, through advances by our  suppliers in reducing their own emissions, and through  increased purchasing of new materials as they enter the  markets, including green steel, low carbon concrete,  and other infrastructure components of a future net  zero carbon economy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,2.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Progress relies on us all counting carbon consistently.
9,Microsoft.pdf,There are several external factors or bugs in the world’s net zero carbon program that if addressed will help us all make greater progress toward our net zero goals.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The world lacks a common meaning of the term net zero and a common unit of measurement for assessing the climate impact of various net zero approaches, and we must all focus on maturing the markets needed to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We explored these topics in greater detail through the lens of our work on carbon removal.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We will continue to innovate and invest to meet our  ambitious commitments and we’ll do so in a principled  way.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We will also continue to be transparent about our  progress, our challenges, and our learnings to help  others on their journey."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"As we look to the future we are  committed to:  
• Counting everything, including challenging Scope 3 emissions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are putting programs in place to help lower them, from working with our suppliers to help them decarbonize to continuing to innovate with our company-wide internal carbon tax to incentivize emissions reduction and continuing to invest in carbon removal."
9,Microsoft.pdf,• Only investing in carbon removal offsets instead of traditional avoided emissions offsets because removal is an underdeveloped and critical tool to solve the world’s climate challenge.
9,Microsoft.pdf,You can only get to net zero when you’ve reduced all that you can and your remaining carbon emissions are completely balanced by long-term carbon removal.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Last year, we made the world’s largest purchase of carbon removal at 1.4 million metric tons and in this fiscal year we are on track to top that by procuring 1.5 million metric tons."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"While 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we’ve  also made some great progress that we share in more  detail in this report."
9,Microsoft.pdf,A few examples that illuminate the  diversity of our work include the following.

9,Microsoft.pdf,"The UPS flywheel has the additional benefit of  avoiding thousands of metric tons of carbon emissions  over its 20-year lifecycle and avoiding 1,500 lead acid  batteries treated as hazardous waste at end-of-life."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are piloting new approaches that lower the carbon  footprint of our code as well as large-scale workloads for  Microsoft and our customers’ benefit.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We piloted a new  feature called Start/Stop VMs, which can automatically  turn off VMs during idle hours."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our engineers have  also created more transparency inside Azure Machine  Learning, displaying resource metrics (including GPU  energy, utilization, and computational cost) to help data  practitioners assess and mitigate the hidden costs of  their machine learning workloads, and partnered with  the Allen Institute for AI to develop a set of best practices  and tools in this space."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We developed the Carbon Aware  Core, which helps schedule workloads in times and  regions with the lowest carbon footprint, which is being  piloted by Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Research and will  be provided as an open-source toolkit through the Green  Software Foundation."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Engineers are also testing and  deploying novel approaches like Kubernetes Scheduler  to take advantage of grid-level fluctuations in carbon  intensity to minimize carbon.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"By 2025, we expect to power our datacenters and  facilities with 100 percent additional, new renewable  energy generation that matches our electricity  consumption on an annual basis."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Already, we’ve contracted for more than 8 GW of  renewable energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In addition to these purchases,  we’re using our campuses as living laboratories for  energy innovation."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We have installed on-site renewables at select campuses  as well.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"At our Silicon Valley campus, a solar panel  system will offset energy consumption up to 15 percent."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our Beijing and Shanghai Zizhu campuses have made  similar efforts, installing photovoltaic (PV) solar panels  on empty roof space in FY20 which are expected to  generate 15,450 MWh of electricity over the next  25 years to power the campus."
9,Microsoft.pdf,LinkedIn’s new campus in  Omaha features an on-site solar array over the parking  structure.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The system has an estimated annual output  of approximately 750,000 kWh/year of electricity,  equivalent to about 15 percent of all site energy usage,  and is being integrated with on-site battery storage to  help reduce peak demand and address any intermittent  excess solar generation produced by the array."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In 2021, we unveiled our plans for a new, hyper-efficient  thermal energy center for our Puget Sound campus,  which utilizes geothermal wells to heat and cool our  buildings—resulting in a 50 percent reduction in energy  usage compared to the typical utility plant."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In our Silicon  Valley campus, thermal energy storage tanks will support  the closed loop water system that provides all heating  and cooling needs for the campus."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are leaving no stones unturned in our quest to reach  net zero.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are eliminating our dependency on diesel  fuel at our datacenters, electrifying our campus fleet,  and moving to all electric kitchens."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Cloud providers around the world rely on diesel-powered  generators for backup power to support continuous  datacenter operations.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Microsoft has committed to be  diesel-free by 2030.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Innovations include the following.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Renewable fuels: Our datacenter region in Sweden  will be one of Microsoft’s first sites to use lower-carbon  renewable fuel for backup power.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The datacenter’s  generators run on Preem Evolution Diesel Plus, the  world’s first Nordic Eco-labelled fuel, which contains at  least 50 percent renewable raw material, and nearly an  equivalent reduction in net carbon dioxide emissions  compared with standard fossil diesel blends."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This solution  is being expanded to other datacenters across the world  with other suppliers.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Batteries as backup power: We are assessing the  long-term feasibility of deploying large batteries as  backup power for critical infrastructure via our strategic  collaboration with TOTAL and are continuing research  and development in this area.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are also implementing  an extended battery solution for datacenters that  operate on highly reliable grids.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Our Swedish campuses  are slated to pilot a battery energy storage system (BESS)  solution to remove reliance on generators.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Hydrogen fuel cells: We are also piloting hydrogen  fuel cells as viable green energy for backup power at  our datacenters.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We announced a worldwide first in  2020—hydrogen fuel cells powering a row of datacenter  servers for 48 consecutive hours.
9,Microsoft.pdf,This successful pilot  provided a proof of concept for supporting backup  power needs that could be implemented once batteries  reach their capacity.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Our primary power supply to an  operating datacenter is now a hydrogen fuel cell.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are committed to fully electrifying our global campus  operations vehicle fleet of over 1,800 vehicles by 2030."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Since announcing this target, we have spent the last  year developing regionally specific implementation  strategies, analyzing the vehicles, and determining the  infrastructure needed to support operations."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In the  coming year, we will launch a series of pilots appropriate  to each region to keep us on track to goal."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In our Puget Sound campus modernization project,  we have removed natural gas from campus, including  cooking over 15,000 meals a day with only renewable  electricity."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"LinkedIn’s updated design and build  guidelines call for all-electric kitchens powered by  renewable energy, designed to cook over 5,000 meals  a day on clean power."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our commitment is that by 2030,  100 percent of Microsoft’s energy  supply, 100 percent of the time, will  come from carbon-free resources."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This commitment completes the link  between carbon-free resources and  our facilities in both space and time.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Hourly renewable supply and demand matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for a decarbonized grid.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The vast majority of Microsoft’s direct carbon emissions  footprint comes from electricity, and as such, our work  on carbon reduction has centered on using less of it,  while at the same time ensuring we support the  adoption of more carbon-free energy in the grids  where we operate."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"While our goal has remained  consistent—to get to an energy supply that is entirely  carbon-free—our approach has evolved as the supply  of renewable energy has increased, markets have  matured, and data has become more granular."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our initial commitment, set in 2012, was to cover  100 percent of our energy consumption with renewable  energy certificates (RECs)."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We achieved our goal that  same year by purchasing enough RECs to cover our  annual energy consumption.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"However, a REC purchase  is not always a direct contract with new renewable  generation and does not always mean that the  renewable generation is on the same grid as where  we are consuming electrons."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Put simply, pursuing  “unbundled” RECs de-linked energy production and  consumption in both geography and time, reducing  the overall impact."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Recognizing the importance of linking our renewable  purchases to new impactful and additional renewable  energy projects, Microsoft began engaging in  renewable energy procurement through power purchase  agreements (PPAs)."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"PPAs are a direct contractual  relationship between a purchaser and a supplier for  new renewable energy via a project or several projects;  that is, the execution of the PPA provides the necessary  revenue stream for new renewable energy projects to  be built."
9,Microsoft.pdf,The direct contract establishes greater investor  confidence in renewable projects and paves the way for  more renewable generation on the grid.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We formalized our commitment to procuring energy  from new impactful renewable energy projects in 2016  and updated it in 2020.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In 2016, Microsoft announced a  commitment to increasing proportion of PPA purchases,  on a path towards 100 percent renewable energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We pledged to procure enough renewable energy to  offset 50 percent of our energy consumption by 2018  and 60 percent in the next decade, and further specified  that we’d aim to secure new renewable energy in the  geography where our offices and datacenters are,  bringing a stronger geographic connection between our  contracted renewables and our electricity consumption."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In 2020, as part of our carbon negative announcements,  we committed to bring our commitment up to 100  percent by 2025."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Like our earlier commitments, this was  on an annual basis, requiring us to sign renewable energy  offtake agreements to cover our energy needs; simply put,  we will match every electron we consume on an annual  basis with renewable energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"While we are proud of this progress, the global shift to  net zero carbon energy is not happening quickly enough."
9,Microsoft.pdf,The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that  the path to net zero emissions is very narrow and will  require the deployment of all available clean energy  technologies between now and 2030.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"For solar power,  it is equivalent to installing the world’s largest solar  park roughly every day."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"4 This reality is due to the fact  that most electrons flowing onto grids today come  from carbon-intensive sources, requiring large-scale  replacement to meet our energy needs."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Currently,  energy storage is not deployed at scale, and the grid  infrastructure of today is old and inadequate to meet  the balancing needs of new renewable energy resources  and the integration of net zero carbon resources, nor  to the increasing consumption demands of a rapidly  electrifying society."
9,Microsoft.pdf,That is why we set a new 100/100/0 goal in 2021.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our commitment is that by 2030, 100 percent of  Microsoft’s energy supply, 100 percent of the time,  will come from zero carbon resources on grids where  we operate."
9,Microsoft.pdf,The 100/100/0 commitment completes  the link between zero carbon resources and our  facilities in both space and time.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our 100/100/0 commitment provides a vision and  roadmap to pair our operational goals with our  research, technologies, and investments to drive  global change."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are bringing new research to  bear, including a white paper authored by RMI  that highlights the potential for hourly energy  monitoring tools to provide transparency into supply  and demand for zero carbon energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,The paper  illustrates that hourly renewable supply and demand  matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for  a decarbonized grid.
9,Microsoft.pdf,The impact of our 100/100/0 commitment will be  significant.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Matching zero carbon resources in both  space and time will reduce Microsoft’s emissions to  zero at all times and also bring benefits to the broader  grid since the zero carbon resources we contract  for will also be available to serve the grid when our  consumption is lower or zero carbon energy output is  higher.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Moreover, we will be driving early deployment  of advanced resources like hydrogen and long- duration storage to fill in the gaps when renewable  energy sources are not generating."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"And finally, the  energy transition will affect all and needs to benefit  all, which is why we have built climate equity into our  purchasing commitments."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Our renewable and zero carbon commitments to date  are having real-world impact.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Microsoft is one of the  largest purchasers of renewable energy in the world.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Across 2020 and the first part of 2021, Microsoft signed  
new purchase agreements for approximately 6 GW of  renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This includes over 35 individual deals, with 15 of those  deals in Europe spanning Denmark, Sweden, Spain, the  United Kingdom, and Ireland."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This latest procurement  brings our operating and contracted renewable energy  projects to 7.8 GW globally and we are positioned to  continue to grow our renewable resource portfolio.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In addition to these PPAs, Microsoft partnered with Volt  Energy, the only national African American owned solar  development company, for a 250-MW portfolio of solar  projects with the intent to create new opportunities for  under-resourced communities and to help support a  more diverse renewable energy industry."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This builds on  our progress on our community purchasing and skilling  work with Sol Systems, which began a year ago."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We’re also taking our learnings from our operational  work and building new products to help accelerate  global decarbonization.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"For example, our research led  to the co-creation and adoption of the first commercial  round-the-clock hourly energy-matching solution with  our utility partner Vattenfall."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Building on this work,  we’re announcing a new around-the-clock pilot in the  Netherlands with energy provider Eneco and FlexiDAO,  a technology supplier, which will match one of our  Amsterdam datacenter’s hourly energy consumption  with the Dutch offshore windfarm Borssele."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We know that our actions alone will not decarbonize the  grids, but we are committed to taking ambitious action  to drive market demand signals that will influence the  speed and scale at which the transformation happens."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"As Microsoft builds the tools and markets to meet our  zero carbon commitments, we are mindful of the need  for products, purchases, and policy that will enable a  carbon-free energy system for all."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"“Every net zero scenario shares a  common, and essential, element: a  massive increase in electrification."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Electricity holds the promise of  wiping out vast sections of the global  emissions portfolio, but this only  happens if the electrons supplying  the electricity are generated from  zero carbon energy sources.”"
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions  by more than half by 2030.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"While we do not have direct  control over most emissions in the Scope 3 category  because they are generated by third parties, they  represent more than 97 percent of our total emissions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our carbon negative commitment includes reducing  these emissions and removing what we cannot reduce,  which we do through a reduction strategy in campuses  and datacenters, rethinking the design of our devices,  and engaging with our supply chain."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This year, we saw  an increase in Scope 3 emissions, driven mainly by the  growth of our cloud services business and an increase  in the sales and usage of our devices."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Changing the way we work begins with measuring our  impact on the planet.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This includes looking at embodied  carbon in each material that goes into our buildings,  as well as the future of how we work, travel, and think  about events."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We’re committed to reducing not just operational  carbon but also embodied carbon—the carbon emitted  during the manufacture and transport of building  materials—which accounts for at least 11 percent of  global emissions and has historically been harder to  track and reduce.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We have taken a number of steps  to address and lower our carbon footprint.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are committed to reducing our  Scope 3 emissions by more than  half by 2030.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We will achieve this  through reduction strategies in  campuses and datacenters,  rethinking design of our devices,  and engaging with our supply chain."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Microsoft partnered with other industry leaders to  create a new open-source, Azure-hosted tool, the  Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), to  track the embodied carbon of the raw building materials."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We used the EC3 tool in designing 17 new buildings  (3 million square feet) in our Puget Sound campus  modernization project, where we are on track to reduce  embodied carbon emissions by at least 30 percent."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are now using the EC3 tool around the world in both  our campuses and our datacenters to track and reduce  embodied carbon and have found opportunities to  reduce concrete and steel embodied carbon by 30 to 60  percent in our datacenters.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"5  
Microsoft and our general contractors are creating  a baseline for construction process emissions, which  include transportation of materials to the construction  site and construction installation."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"To date, there has  been little data and no established, industry-consistent  methodology for creating a baseline, making it difficult  for design teams to know if their emissions are better or  worse than a typical construction project."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We piloted the  tracking of construction activity emissions in our Puget  Sound campus modernization project, starting with the  demolition phase (including site excavation), as well as  how much water we used."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are innovating and investing in low-carbon building  materials across our global campuses and datacenters  with the aim to achieve net zero embodied carbon,  including the following."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Mass timber: At our Silicon Valley campus, we are using  mass timber, resulting in the largest mass timber building  in the United States."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In addition to using this lower  carbon building material, we elected to keep two of the  existing buildings on the site, providing 36 percent of the  new campus footprint and accounting for a 28.6 percent  reduction in total embodied carbon."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"5 With two floors  of mass timber, the embodied carbon savings increases  to approximately 36 percent with an estimated total  of 372 kg CO2e per square meter."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"5 With over 345,000  square feet, or 2,400 tons, of 100 percent Forest  Stewardship Council (FSC) certified mass timber, the  wood reflects biophilic principles and a reduced carbon  mission."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We continue to incorporate mass timber on our  campuses and are now testing the suitability of mass  timber in datacenter environments and investigating  sites to pilot these new materials.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Cement: Cement accounts for approximately 8 percent  of global emissions.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are testing and piloting low- GHG cement innovations like CarbonCure to reduce  the carbon footprint of our buildings.
9,Microsoft.pdf,LinkedIn is using  low-carbon and carbon-sequestering concrete mixes  for our new Silicon Valley headquarters and is now using  these materials in our LinkedIn Dublin campus.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In our  datacenters, we are reducing how much cement we use  by utilizing longer 56-day cure times in lieu of typical  28-day cure times."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are also specifying the use of  cement replacement products such as fly ash and slag  that reduce the carbon footprint of concrete.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Low-carbon materials: We also completed research  on low-carbon materials in collaboration with Carbon  Leadership Forum (CLF), a nonprofit industry academic  organization at the University of Washington."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The research explores six low-carbon materials—earthen  slabs, non-Portland cement concrete slabs, algae-grown  bricks/panels, mycelium (mushroom) structural tubes,  purpose-grown fiber, and agricultural waste panels—  that can help reduce carbon emissions and change the  climate profile of building constructions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are piloting  the use of these materials for our datacenters.
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are innovating and investing in  low-carbon building materials across  our global campuses and datacenters  with the aim to achieve net zero  embodied carbon.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Although emissions related to business travel  represented less than 5 percent of our total emissions,  we know that we can have a larger impact with our  investments and partnerships."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We have made two  investments in SAF with airline partners KLM and  Alaska.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This year, we expanded this work by becoming  a founding member in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers  
Alliance (SABA) and participating in the World Economic  Forum’s “Clean Skies for Tomorrow.” We are actively  supporting the development of an SAF certificate which  will set GHG accounting standards for the use of SAF to  reduce emissions by both customers and airlines in the  future."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are also looking to reduce emissions in other  areas where our learnings in SAF can be applied, from  freight and logistics to the fuel used in our datacenter  backup generators."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Over the past year, devices became even more essential  as they kept us connected, working, and learning  through the pandemic."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This year, higher-than-anticipated  demand translated to higher sales and greater usage,  which caused our absolute emissions to grow."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We are  committed to reducing the carbon intensity of our  devices and our efforts have also grown this year.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We have made significant investments to expand our  data-driven lifecycle assessment (LCA) and telemetry  approach to better measure, inform, and prioritize top  reduction opportunities to reduce our device carbon  intensity across the full lifecycle of our devices."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"These efforts include carbon-conscious design, reducing  supply chain emissions, innovating energy-efficient  hardware and software in use, and enabling product  repairability, reusability, and recyclability."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This will allow  us to deliver the best product experience with lower  carbon intensity, while also partnering with our users to  minimize carbon footprint when using our products."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In 2020, we began working on a platform to allow  engineers to make real-time design and material  selection decisions based on carbon impact, a key  enabler in modeling and reducing our future device  emissions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"To generate our device carbon footprints,  we conduct LCAs in accordance with ISO 14040 and  ISO 14044 which enable us to estimate emissions from  manufacturing our devices down to the individual  component level."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Further, we are upgrading our audit  management sourcing tool to ensure supplier carbon  reduction initiatives are fully reflected in these product  carbon footprints."
9,Microsoft.pdf,We pair this with improved product  usage and distribution data.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"For example, the most  recent iterations of the Xbox Series X|S have improved  our awareness of full ecosystem energy usage from  consoles, information which is critical to future energy  efficiency improvements and emissions reductions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,These investments allow us more control over our  product emissions across their full lifecycle.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"As informed by our LCAs, a significant lever in product  development is the engineering of low-carbon design  alternatives, such as using recycled materials and  designing for a smaller manufacturing footprint."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We designed our Surface Laptop Studio to allow for  “stamping,” a lower-waste manufacturing technique  that reduced our aluminum scrap rate for the product’s  base by at least 25 percent, a key contributor to an  overall product carbon reduction of 30 percent versus  its predecessor, the Surface Book 3 13”."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"6  
We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing  scrap in aluminum production, allowing us to use lower- carbon, 100 percent post-industrial recycled closed  loop aluminum for future Surface computer housings."

9,Microsoft.pdf,"In our labs, we are working to engineer a lower-carbon  and reduced-waste flax-based wiring board and  experimenting with 3D printing; we have started to  explore 100 percent post-industrial recycled tin in our  soldering paste; and we are aiming to reduce overall  materials needed through new spacing guidelines that  can shrink our circuit boards in size by up to 25 percent."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Reduction in total carbon  emissions of 30 percent  for Surface Laptop Studio  versus its predecessor,  Surface Book 3 13”."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Microsoft is an active member in the Global Logistics  Emissions Council (GLEC), an industry collaboration  through Smart Freight Centre, committing to  reducing logistics emissions through sustainable  freight initiatives."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Microsoft uses this framework to  calculate and measure the carbon impact of its Scope 3  transportation emissions.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"7  
For shipping, we have an intelligent platform to measure  our emissions impact down to individual shipments,  and a carbon emissions budget has been developed  utilizing the same methodology."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In our distribution  network, this year we finished a complete conversion of  our primary distribution center in Europe to 100 percent  renewable energy."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This facility now generates 1.3 million  kWh from solar energy and avoids 690 mtCO2 annually.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Through FY22 we will plan to convert our US distribution  centers to 100 percent renewable energy through solar  panel installations and using green renewable sources.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are also building more sustainable shipping options,  such as the delivery option launched in December 2021 to  avoid higher-carbon air freight, to give customers a choice  of more sustainable options when ordering from Microsoft."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"For Microsoft devices, energy efficiency is a balance of  hardware and software innovation."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This year, overall  device and console use phase emissions grew as a result  of higher sales and usage from customers reliant on  these products during the pandemic."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"That being said,  several of our newest products launched in 2021 were  designed to be the most energy efficient devices in their  product lines, including the Surface Pro 8 and Surface  Laptop 4 running Windows 11."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The most recent iterations  of the Xbox Series X|S have improved our awareness of  full ecosystem energy usage from consoles, information  which is critical to future energy efficiency improvements  and emissions reductions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Software design can also increase efficiency.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We are  focused on offering low-emissions usage options such as  Energy-saving mode on Xbox, which can reduce power  usage during standby mode from 15 W down to 0.5–2 W,  as well as Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will be powered by  Azure datacenters running on 100% renewable energy  by 2025."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"With the release of energy-saving mode, we  are updating the initial bootup experience for users to  provide clear messaging to enable user understanding  of power modes, while encouraging them to implement  energy-saving mode on their consoles."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This will be  paired with a reduction in idle and shutdown timers to  continue to improve power consumption during console  idle periods.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"To increase transparency for customers and stakeholders,  we publish LCA results for our Xbox consoles and Surface  devices."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"The LCA results are contained in our Ecoprofiles,  along with information about the product’s material  composition, energy consumption, packaging, ecolabels,  product recycling, and other environmental attributes."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We have also developed a new, dynamic way for  commercial customers to gain insight into the  carbon footprint of their entire Surface device fleets."
9,Microsoft.pdf,The Microsoft Surface Emissions Estimator enables sellers  to work with customers and estimate the carbon impact  of the Surface devices and key accessories they purchase  from us.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In July 2020, Microsoft added additional sustainability  requirements to its Supplier Code of Conduct to support  the company’s bold carbon ambitions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This new language  requires suppliers to disclose their own carbon footprints  and develop plans to reduce them.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Microsoft has spent  the past year rolling out these requirements to a subset  of its suppliers and building a program to support them.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In July 2021, 87 percent of Microsoft’s in-scope suppliers  reported their emissions to CDP, up 12 percent from  2020."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Following the closure of the CDP cycle, we worked  with suppliers to build action plans of emission reduction  activities leading up to 2030."
9,Microsoft.pdf,This included educational  webinars and one-on-one meetings with suppliers to  dive into their individual footprints and discuss relevant  reduction levers.
9,Microsoft.pdf,Microsoft also provided suppliers with  resources to aid in their reduction efforts.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We continue to  believe that for Microsoft to reach our reduction goals,  collaboration with suppliers is fundamental and we look  forward to continuing the journey together."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In 2021, we released a set of in-depth  capacity-building tools and resources  to help our suppliers report their  GHG emissions, develop clean energy  strategies, and reduce their energy- related emissions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"When Microsoft rolled out emission reporting and  reduction requirements in our Supplier Code of Conduct,  the top feedback from suppliers was the need for simple  yet comprehensive resources to walk them through the  carbon accounting process."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In response, we released a  set of in-depth capacity-building tools and resources,  developed in partnership with ENGIE Impact, WSP, and  CDP to help companies, and particularly our suppliers,  report their GHG emissions, develop clean energy  strategies, and reduce their energy-related emissions."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In September 2021, LinkedIn released a new course,  Fundamentals of Sustainable Supply Chain Management,  to help organizations and professionals more effectively  engage with their suppliers."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Based on our engagements with suppliers, we knew  more technical resources were necessary but insufficient  to drive change."
9,Microsoft.pdf,Our suppliers need access to new  forms of finance to invest in new solutions.
9,Microsoft.pdf,"This year,  we launched a new partnership with the International  Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank  Group."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"IFC will work with designated Microsoft suppliers  in emerging markets, starting in Asia, to identify  technical solutions reducing GHG emissions, provide  implementation assistance, and offer financing solutions  to help them make investments in more efficient and  low-carbon operations."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We have taken a first-of-a-kind approach towards  designing and implementing Circular Centers in  our datacenter campuses, aligning our end-of-life  dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across  the entire supply chain."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"From sustainable design at  the start of an asset lifecycle to sustainable sourcing,  
manufacturing, delivery, and use, towards a diversified  approach after decommissioning, this integrated  plan ensures that assets are dispositioned to optimize  value, security, compliance, and sustainability."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Over the  past year, we have engaged with new suppliers who  are able to remanufacture assets and components,  effectively enabling new lifecycles for our assets."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We have successfully demonstrated takeback/buyback  models with our original asset suppliers, closing the  loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or  reuse assets and components, resulting in significant  sustainability outcomes for emissions reduction and  material recovery."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our Circular Center program will  enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter computing  assets, significantly contributing to our goal of reducing  emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In FY21, our  overall reuse of assets was 78 percent."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"As we outline in Chapter 4 of our Responsible Sourcing  2021 Report, we are executing an ambitious plan to  empower all strategic device suppliers to commit to  science-based carbon reduction activities specifically  targeted to reduce emissions associated with hardware  manufacturing."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"We have used LCAs to prioritize supplier  categories that contribute the greatest emissions as well  as the types of actions suppliers can take to make the  biggest shifts in decarbonization, including powering  their operations with renewable energy, increasing  process and energy efficiencies, and reducing material  use and waste onsite."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"In January 2021, Microsoft announced that we had made  the world’s largest purchase of carbon removal in history."
9,Microsoft.pdf,"Our focus on removals instead of avoided emissions  offsets is aligned to our carbon negative commitment but  is also motivated by what climate science tells us is needed  to reach net zero—specifically the IPCC’s projection that  the planet could need as much as 10 gigatons of carbon  dioxide removal by mid-century, depending on the scale  and pace of decarbonization."

10,Apple.pdf,"Energy efficiency  We will increase energy efficiency at our own facilities  and in our supply chain by finding opportunities, such  as retrofitting, to reduce energy use."
10,Apple.pdf,"Direct emissions abatement  We will avoid direct greenhouse gas emissions in our  own facilities and in our supply chain through process  innovation, emissions abatement, and the use of  non-fossil-based low-carbon fuels."
10,Apple.pdf,Scope 1 emissions are those greenhouse  gases resulting from fuel combustion from  sources we own or operate—like vehicles   or natural gas for heating.
10,Apple.pdf,Scope 2 emissions refer to those resulting  from the use of electricity.
10,Apple.pdf,"Renewable energy  generates minimal Scope 2 emissions, whereas  burning coal, oil, or natural gas to produce  electricity releases carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."
10,Apple.pdf,"Scope 3 emissions refer to all other   indirect emissions that occur in a company’s  value chain, including upstream and  downstream activities."
10,Apple.pdf,"To achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030, we must first  understand our carbon footprint today."
10,Apple.pdf,"So we meticulously  model emissions from our entire value chain, including both our  corporate operations and our full product life cycle."
10,Apple.pdf,"That includes  emissions from manufacturing, transporting, using, and even  recycling our devices."
10,Apple.pdf,This data defines our strategy to reduce  emissions by 75 percent and reach neutrality across our product  life cycle.
10,Apple.pdf,Our plan to become carbon  neutral by 2030 centers  around a 75 percent  emissions reduction relative  to our 2015 footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,We  plan to address residual  emissions through carbon  removals.
10,Apple.pdf,Already we’ve  reduced our carbon footprint  by 40 percent since 2015.
10,Apple.pdf,Note: We include a range  for recently estimated  emissions to reflect the  potential variances inherent  to modeling product-related  carbon emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"Each year,  we refine our methodology  to ensure the accuracy of  our estimates."
10,Apple.pdf,Projected  emissions are displayed with  a straight-line trajectory  toward a reduction of 75  percent by 2030.
10,Apple.pdf,Projected  carbon removal is displayed  with a similar straight-line  growth to reach net zero  carbon emissions by 2030.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our footprint has decreased by 40 percent, marking steady  progress toward our 2030 target."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we avoided more than  15 million metric tons of emissions through initiatives to use  low-carbon materials, drive energy efficiency, and switch to  clean energy—carbon reduction efforts that separated a rise  in sales from increases in our carbon footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our historical  emissions challenge the idea that good business requires  growth in carbon emissions, and we aim to show this even  more clearly going forward."
10,Apple.pdf,We calculate our comprehensive carbon footprint using a life  cycle–based approach.
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple-specific data drives many of our  most critical calculations; in cases where that data isn’t available  we rely on secondary sources, including industry averages."
10,Apple.pdf,We  continually refine our model to include new sources of product  life cycle data—and offer a more accurate and transparent  assessment of our footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,Our comprehensive carbon footprint  and our methodology are verified by a third party each year to  ensure accuracy and transparency (see Appendix C).
10,Apple.pdf,"Improving  the accuracy of our carbon footprint is an ongoing process  we work on continually—as we learn more, we will revise our  roadmap to incorporate new information."
10,Apple.pdf,"And, as our data  improves, we will continually refine our emissions from previous  years and our projections."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re focused on the road ahead, demonstrated by our  pursuit of carbon neutrality by 2030."
10,Apple.pdf,This goal sets us ahead  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  recommendations by 20 years—because we believe our planet  and our most vulnerable communities can’t wait.
10,Apple.pdf,"We aim to  reach neutrality by reducing emissions by 75 percent relative to  our 2015 baseline, while addressing residual emissions through  carbon removals.1 
Our journey to address our corporate emissions signals our plan  to reach carbon neutrality for our full supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"Since 2011,  our scopes 1 and 2 emissions have declined by 73 percent,  and we had zero scope 2 electricity-related emissions for the  second year in a row."
10,Apple.pdf,"Even as our business grew, our work to drive  energy efficiency and transition to renewable energy reduced  our footprint—avoiding over 4.6 million metric tons of emissions,  the equivalent of taking almost 1 million cars off the road for a  year.2 We’ve addressed our remaining scope 1 emissions through  nature-based solutions, achieving carbon neutrality for our  corporate footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re looking to the future by conducting a climate scenario  analysis that helps us better understand the potential physical  and transition effects of climate change.
10,Apple.pdf,"To align with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range  of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2° Celsius."
10,Apple.pdf,And we assessed geographies around the world to capture  both corporate and supplier activities.
10,Apple.pdf,The analysis highlighted  how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals  could contribute to our corporate resiliency.
10,Apple.pdf,"It also provided  environmental data that we’ll consider in our strategies to  maintain supply chain diversification, as well as promote the  security of global assets."
10,Apple.pdf,"By switching to recycled   and hydro-smelted  aluminum, our carbon  emissions associated  with aluminum have  decreased by 72 percent  since 2015."
10,Apple.pdf,Switching to the Apple   M1 chip for Mac mini  reduced the energy  needed to use the device  and drove down the  product’s carbon footprint  by 34 percent.
10,Apple.pdf,We believe that well-designed products  have a lower environmental footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"This is  a principle we strive to bring to everything we  create, and a central pillar of our 2030 goal  to achieve carbon neutrality for our entire  product life cycle."
10,Apple.pdf,"Each year, we aim to reduce the carbon emissions that result  from manufacturing and the use of our devices, without  compromising performance."
10,Apple.pdf,Our carbon footprint helps us identify opportunities to reduce the  carbon intensity of our product designs.
10,Apple.pdf,We work to transition to  materials from recycled sources or those made using low-carbon  energy.
10,Apple.pdf,"We prioritize the materials and components that account  for significant portions of our carbon emissions, so that the  choices we make product-by-product can scale toward reducing  our overall footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,Less means more when it comes to our approach with materials.
10,Apple.pdf,"As we reduce the amount of materials used to make our products,  we see greater progress toward our goal of carbon neutrality."
10,Apple.pdf,This helps us reduce the transportation and energy-intensive  processing these materials require as well as limit the amount  of scrap generated along the way.
10,Apple.pdf,"We continue to investigate  new ways to manufacture more efficiently, limiting the amount  of waste created in the process."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, we’ve made clear gains with our work on integrated  circuits and boards and flexes—components we’ve prioritized  because they are carbon-intensive."
10,Apple.pdf,"Integrated circuits perform  vital functions in electronic devices, yet require significant energy  to manufacture."
10,Apple.pdf,"With the Apple M1 chip, we’ve created a more  efficiently designed chip tailored to the needs of Mac devices."
10,Apple.pdf,This efficiency gain also brings with it environmental benefits.
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, switching to the Apple M1 chip for Mac mini reduced  the energy needed to use the device and drove down the  product’s overall carbon footprint by 34 percent.4 
We’re also driving efficiencies in the design of boards and flexes,  which account for significant carbon emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve launched  a strategic initiative to optimize our designs to find alternatives to  these components and reduce their contributions to our footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, with iPad (8th generation) we switched from using  flexes to lower-carbon alternatives in certain applications—one  of many changes that helped reduce the total carbon footprint of  the product by 7 percent compared to the previous generation."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also focusing on the accessories we ship with each  product.
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 6 devices  shipped without power adapters in the box."
10,Apple.pdf,"The change allowed  for smaller, lighter packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,"It also allowed us to fit up to  70 percent more products on a shipping pallet—which, in turn,  helps reduce emissions associated with shipping."
10,Apple.pdf,This change  also eliminated the need for significant quantities of plastic  and zinc since power adapters comprise our largest usage  of these materials.
10,Apple.pdf,Another design consideration is our choice of materials.
10,Apple.pdf,"By transitioning to materials that lend themselves more readily  to low-carbon processing and recycling, we can reduce our  carbon footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"As these materials account for more significant  proportions of the materials we use, we move closer to our goal  of carbon neutrality for our products."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve seen clear progress with aluminum—a material where  we’ve had success in shifting to recycled materials and those  generated from low-carbon processes.
10,Apple.pdf,"Several of our products  use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures— including our latest MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the latest iPad  devices."
10,Apple.pdf,And all enclosures made with virgin aluminum for  products released in 2020 were smelted using hydroelectricity  rather than fossil fuels—for a lower carbon impact.
10,Apple.pdf,"As a result of  these changes, our carbon emissions associated with aluminum  have decreased by 72 percent since 2015."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also making progress in how we source recycled aluminum.
10,Apple.pdf,The material we derive from our manufacturing scrap provides  high-quality aluminum with fewer associated carbon emissions  than newly mined materials.
10,Apple.pdf,"And, for the first time, we’re  expanding our sourcing to include post-consumer recycled  aluminum from building and construction scrap that meets  the high standards our products require."
10,Apple.pdf,"iPad (8th generation) consumes  66 percent less energy than   the requirement for ENERGY  STAR, thanks in part to a more   energy-efficient power adapter.9  
Designing energy-efficient products even as we continually  enhance performance represents another essential pillar of our  approach to carbon neutrality."
10,Apple.pdf,Product energy use accounts  for 19 percent of our carbon footprint—and has an impact  on the individual energy use of each of our customers.
10,Apple.pdf,This  is why we’ve set aggressive targets to reduce our products’  energy usage.
10,Apple.pdf,"We approach this challenge in the earliest  phases of design, taking a holistic view of each product from  how efficiently software operates to the power requirements of  individual components."
10,Apple.pdf,"While this is a continual effort with each new generation of  products, we’ve already made progress."
10,Apple.pdf,"The transition to  Apple silicon on Mac devices, for example, is driving efficiency  improvements—the Mac mini consumes up to 60 percent  less energy while in active use than the previous generation.5  Through our efforts to improve energy efficiency, the average  product energy use across all major product lines has  declined by more than 70 percent since 2008.6 And Apple  products are consistently ranked by ENERGY STAR, which  sets specifications that typically reflect the 25 percent most  energy-efficient devices on the market."
10,Apple.pdf,The group recognized  Pro Display XDR on the ENERGY STAR Most Efficient List for  2020 and 2021.
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, 100 percent of our eligible  products received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy  efficiency.7 And 100 percent of our eligible products earned  the highest award from EPEAT, another environmental rating  system for electronic products that considers energy efficiency  a highlighted feature.8"
10,Apple.pdf,"Suppliers in our Supplier  Energy Efficiency  program avoided more  than 900,000 annualized  metric tons of supply chain  carbon emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,Our energy efficiency goals extend well  beyond our products.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re focused on using  less energy across our operations, beginning  with how we design, operate, and maintain our  facilities."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we continue these same efforts  into our supply chain, which benefits those  living in areas where our suppliers operate."
10,Apple.pdf,Drawing less energy from electrical grids—many of which still  rely heavily on fossil fuels—helps reduce local air pollution and  improve air quality for nearby communities.
10,Apple.pdf,Reducing energy use is an essential business process.
10,Apple.pdf,"We track  and monitor energy use across our operations and supply chain,  conducting audits to find opportunities to work more efficiently."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we view our energy use holistically, from the point of design  to the point of manufacture."
10,Apple.pdf,Finding ways to avoid using energy in the first place is the central  focus of our energy efficiency program.
10,Apple.pdf,We work with design  teams to tailor our building systems selection process to our  occupants’ and lab users’ specific needs.
10,Apple.pdf,This helps ensure  our facilities are utilized efficiently and productively.
10,Apple.pdf,"We focus  on natural gas and electricity usage at each site—our offices,  data centers, R&D facilities, and retail stores—auditing how we  perform and, when needed, using best practices for energy  management to reduce our loads."
10,Apple.pdf,Measurement is critical to this.
10,Apple.pdf,We continue to develop our  system of energy tracking and benchmarking.
10,Apple.pdf,This helps us  identify performance issues at our sites early.
10,Apple.pdf,We can then take  corrective action to restore building system efficiencies and  actively manage our energy footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also working to find energy savings through different  approaches—from renovating and retrofitting more than 100  older locations to collaborating with our local utilities to ensure  that we deploy the best available energy efficiency strategies.
10,Apple.pdf,"As we renovate sites, we review all aspects of the building for  efficiency opportunities—from lighting and electrical systems  to heating and cooling systems."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, in Santa Clara  Valley, we worked directly with PG&E and Silicon Valley Power to  optimize how we run select facilities, so that we draw less energy  from the grid."
10,Apple.pdf,Energy efficiency principles are incorporated early in the design  of new facilities.
10,Apple.pdf,"We look at each location’s conditions, designing  and building to local temperature, humidity, and light."
10,Apple.pdf,"As each site  becomes operational, we monitor how well we’re performing and  make needed adjustments."
10,Apple.pdf,And we opened new retail locations  in 2020 based on our energy-efficient retail facilities prototype.
10,Apple.pdf,We can see the results of these efforts.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our data centers, for  example, perform about 60 percent better than the ASHRAE  90.4 baseline specific to data centers.12 And design optimizations  at our Flagship Stores locations are expected to contribute up  to about 40 percent energy savings, compared to the ASHRAE  benchmark."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, our energy efficiency program  helped us reduce our usage by an additional 13.9 million   kilowatt-hours and 199,700 therms per year through adjustments  made to 7.1 million square feet of new and existing buildings.13  Together, these new initiatives reduce total energy use by   five percent in targeted buildings and will avoid about  4,900 metric tons of CO2e per year."
10,Apple.pdf,The most significant opportunity to make an impact on energy  efficiency is with our suppliers.
10,Apple.pdf,"Currently, manufacturing accounts  for approximately 70 percent of Apple’s comprehensive carbon  footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"Energy usage drives those emissions, so with our  suppliers, we prioritize optimizing energy use and then shifting  to renewable energy sources."
10,Apple.pdf,Our Supplier Energy Efficiency program works side-by-side  with our Supplier Clean Energy program in supporting suppliers  to reduce emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"By helping a supplier reduce the energy  they use, we lower the amount of renewable energy they will  need to meet their clean energy commitments."
10,Apple.pdf,"While not all  suppliers have the same level of access to renewables, each has  the opportunity to work more efficiently with the energy they’re  using."
10,Apple.pdf,We began addressing energy efficiency with the suppliers  who expressed interest in optimizing their energy use and with  manufacturers with significant energy usage.
10,Apple.pdf,"Now we’re focusing on scaling the program content and services  to the broader supply chain, as part of our strategic effort to  reduce the energy required to make our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"From the  collaborative actions we’ve taken with our suppliers to accelerate  toward carbon neutrality, more than 900,000 annualized metric  tons of supply chain carbon emissions were avoided,   a 44 percent improvement over 2019.14"
10,Apple.pdf,"As suppliers join our energy efficiency program, we encourage  them to deeply understand their greenhouse gas emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,"As of  2019, we required our suppliers to report both their emissions and  their reduction targets.15 
To help suppliers reduce their energy use, we provide guidance  designed to help them uncover opportunities for energy  efficiency."
10,Apple.pdf,We also assist them with assessments and technical  issues where appropriate.
10,Apple.pdf,"Typical projects may include replacing  outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems;  repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve also provided support through workshops and trainings,  including multiday classroom trainings for employees complete  with a capstone project."
10,Apple.pdf,"We continue to expand the support  we provide to suppliers as they build more energy-efficient  systems, through new training materials and increased access  to funding opportunities."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re focused on the impact of some of our most popular  products.
10,Apple.pdf,One example is our three-year initiative to improve  the efficiency of iPhone manufacturing.
10,Apple.pdf,"Collectively, the six  participating supplier facilities achieved their goal of 20 percent  reductions by the end of 2020 compared to the established  2017 baseline."
10,Apple.pdf,"In addition, final assembly sites for AirPods, iPad,  and Apple Watch have all launched multiyear energy reduction  initiatives in 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"To ensure that our work to protect the planet also helps advance  equality, Apple has launched an Impact Accelerator for Black- and  Brown-owned businesses.16 The Accelerator expands access  to opportunity by ensuring that our investments in sectors like  renewable energy, carbon removal, and recycling innovation  also help fight systemic barriers impacting communities that are  disproportionately affected by environmental issues like climate  change."
10,Apple.pdf,"With customized training, access to Apple experts,  and an expanding alumni community, our Impact Accelerator is  tailored to support companies as they achieve their next stage  of development."
10,Apple.pdf,"The Impact Accelerator is just one of many efforts within Apple’s  $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, which focuses on  efforts that address education, economic equality, and criminal  justice reform in the United States."
10,Apple.pdf,"With our partners in these  efforts, we aim to redefine business as usual and drive progress  toward a more equitable future."
10,Apple.pdf,"To apply to our Impact Accelerator program, or to learn   more about our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, visit   www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative."
10,Apple.pdf,Supplier engagement Apple connects suppliers  interested in energy savings to  service providers specializing  in energy management and  project capital investment.
10,Apple.pdf,Service identification  Investor and supplier work  together directly to identify  energy-saving opportunities   at the supplier site and confirm  which ones they would like   to pursue.
10,Apple.pdf,Energy efficiency updates Investor provides energy  efficiency as a service by  making any needed process   or equipment updates to  create energy savings.
10,Apple.pdf,"Energy savings and  investment return As the supplier manufactures  products for Apple and others,  the supplier experiences a cost  savings from reduced energy  use and shares that savings  with the investor."
10,Apple.pdf,"Last year, one of our manufacturers in  Guangzhou, China, deployed a state-of- the-art energy management system."
10,Apple.pdf,"With  the system in place, the manufacturer can  monitor and optimize their complex network  of air conditioners, fans, pumps, and air  compressors at the facility."
10,Apple.pdf,"The new system allowed the facility managers to find efficiencies  in energy usage across their site, even as the facility carried  out highly engineered and specified manufacturing processes  for Apple."
10,Apple.pdf,The facility team also installed a waste heat recovery  system that captured the heat generated by energy-intensive  equipment—like air compressors—and converted it to warm  water for use in living areas.
10,Apple.pdf,These upgrades improved the energy  efficiency at the manufacturer’s site and helped to reduce the  facility’s carbon impact.
10,Apple.pdf,Energy efficiency upgrades like these require a combination of  innovative technical solutions and organizational priorities that  support these goals.
10,Apple.pdf,"But, there’s another important element:  capital investment."
10,Apple.pdf,"The project at the Guangzhou manufacturing  site was made possible by capital from Asia Green Fund, as part  of a US$100 million investment initiative."
10,Apple.pdf,This initiative brings together Asia Green Fund’s investors and  energy management contractors to offer energy efficiency as  a service to participating suppliers for the first time.
10,Apple.pdf,This fund  makes energy-saving opportunities accessible to suppliers—  the upfront investment challenges and implementation risks will  be taken by the investors.
10,Apple.pdf,"As our suppliers realize savings from  energy costs, investors recoup their capital."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple doesn’t directly invest capital or draw financial returns  through this initiative, but connects suppliers to Asia Green  Fund that offers both financing and energy efficiency expertise  to support complex capital intensive projects."
10,Apple.pdf,A key barrier to  achieving energy efficiency at scale is access to capital funding.
10,Apple.pdf,“Energy efficiency as a service” through the fund presents an  alternative approach to solve this challenge.
10,Apple.pdf,"The fund draws  on Apple’s relationships and deep knowledge of our suppliers’  facilities and engineering processes, resulting in supplier projects  that improve energy efficiency and positive environmental impact."
10,Apple.pdf,"These benefits carry over to the other technology products our  suppliers create as well, reducing both our footprint and those  of our industry."
10,Apple.pdf,"To date, US$7.5 million of investments have been  made in supplier efficiency projects using this model, bringing us  closer to our goal of carbon neutrality."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re at a pivotal moment in addressing  climate change.
10,Apple.pdf,Renewable energy is  poised to replace fossil fuels as the future  of electricity.
10,Apple.pdf,"Its adoption means healthier air,  stronger local economies, and lower carbon  emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,All at cost-competitive rates.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our commitment to transition to 100 percent renewable energy for  our entire supply chain enables resiliency in the face of challenges  like climate change, and moves us closer to becoming carbon  neutral by 2030."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2018, we announced our own operations were fully transitioned  to 100 percent renewable electricity."
10,Apple.pdf,And we continue to expand on  our commitment to green technologies by bringing new renewable  electricity projects online around the world.
10,Apple.pdf,"In the long term, these  projects provide more cost-effective energy with less price volatility."
10,Apple.pdf,"Renewable electricity can offer a clear competitive advantage by  providing power to our operations, as well as those of our suppliers,  with greater control over energy supply and little exposure to cost  fluctuations."
10,Apple.pdf,"And by adopting green technologies, we and our  suppliers are in a unique position to drive environmental action  and support our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030."
10,Apple.pdf,Our approach is twofold.
10,Apple.pdf,"We find ways to consume energy more  efficiently, and we seek out opportunities to transition to renewable  sources that support our goal of 100 percent renewable energy  across our operations and supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"With the renewable energy we source, we aim to achieve the  greatest impact possible."
10,Apple.pdf,"Before we engage in an energy project,  we evaluate it with a holistic view of its potential environmental and  social impact."
10,Apple.pdf,"Whenever possible, we create new renewable energy,  going above and beyond what might be available on the local grid."
10,Apple.pdf,We also follow stringent accountability standards to verify our clean  energy projects.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our retail stores, data centers, and offices around the world  currently source 100 percent renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"We are proud of  this accomplishment—and as we grow, we’re working diligently  to maintain this benchmark."
10,Apple.pdf,"Where possible, we focus on creating  new renewables."
10,Apple.pdf,"New renewables require investment—whether  in the form of direct ownership of renewable energy projects,  equity investments, or long-term power purchase agreements."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our projects in 2020 included more than 180 megawatts of  solar power near Fredricksburg, Virginia, and outside of Reno,  Nevada, as well as 130 megawatts of wind power near Chicago,  and in Viborg, Denmark."
10,Apple.pdf,"In total, Apple-created renewable  sources account for 90 percent of the renewable electricity our  facilities use—around 1.5 gigawatts currently in use and another  30 megawatts under contract."
10,Apple.pdf,"Direct ownership (10 percent of Apple-created projects) We build our own projects, including solar, biogas fuel cells,  and low-impact hydro projects, where feasible, to provide  renewable electricity."
10,Apple.pdf,"Equity investment (3 percent of Apple-created projects)  We invest capital in new solar PV or wind projects in some markets,  matching the renewable generation with our energy use."
10,Apple.pdf,Long-term renewable energy contracts  (87 percent of Apple-created projects) We sign long-term contracts for renewable electricity when  needed.
10,Apple.pdf,"Through power purchase agreements, virtual  power purchase agreements, and other forms of long-term  commitments, we help support new, local, and primarily solar  PV and wind projects that are in line with our renewable energy– sourcing standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"To cover any gaps in our renewable energy needs beyond  what’s provided by Apple-created projects, we directly purchase  renewable energy—about 5 percent of our total corporate  load—through available utility green energy programs."
10,Apple.pdf,Colocation  facility vendors also supply about 3 percent of our total load of  renewable energy.
10,Apple.pdf,"And in certain situations, we go to the market  for renewable energy credits (RECs)—for example, when we  need to bridge before a renewable project comes online or  when there’s a lack of availability."
10,Apple.pdf,"These RECs, which account  for about 1 percent of our total load, must be tied to recently  constructed projects, Green-e Energy certified, where available,  and share the same power grid as the Apple facility they support."
10,Apple.pdf,These purchases are subject to the same standards as our  Apple-created renewables.
10,Apple.pdf,Appendix C provides additional  details on Apple’s renewable energy solutions.
10,Apple.pdf,Achieving 100 percent renewable energy at Apple facilities  provided us a starting point to make an even greater impact.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve focused our efforts to source renewables around several  key pillars: undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to  local communities, working on storage solutions that facilitate  the use of renewable electricity, and supporting renewable  energy innovations."
10,Apple.pdf,"Supporting social impact Power for Impact, the program we launched in 2019, continues  to provide local communities with needed energy resources."
10,Apple.pdf,"Following our initial projects—solar developments in communities  in the Philippines and Thailand facing energy cost and availability  challenges—we supported solar power in Diepsloot, a densely  populated township in Johannesburg, South Africa, home to an  estimated 180,000 families."
10,Apple.pdf,"A portion of these families lack many  essential services including potable water, waste management,  and electricity."
10,Apple.pdf,This system combines 152 kilowatts of PV and  830 kilowatt hours of storage across 230 solar towers and will  provide electricity to more than 3600 households.
10,Apple.pdf,Developing energy storage Wind and solar power provide the most cost-effective new  source of electricity to many parts of the world.
10,Apple.pdf,"Yet, the  intermittent nature of these technologies has presented an  obstacle to widespread adoption—and resulted in continued  reliance on fossil fuel–powered grids."
10,Apple.pdf,"One solution to  intermittency is energy storage, which can retain generated  power until it is needed."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve invested in utility scale storage in  California and in research into new energy storage technologies,  even as we continue to build upon our distributed storage  capabilities in Santa Clara Valley and optimize storage at our  Apple Park microgrid."
10,Apple.pdf,Apple is sponsoring the construction of one of the largest battery  projects in the country—an industry-leading grid-scale energy  storage project in California capable of storing 240 megawatt- hours of electricity.
10,Apple.pdf,"This project supports our 130-megawatt  California Flats solar farm that provides all of our renewable  energy in California, by storing excess energy generated during  the day and deploying it when it is most valuable."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re also continuing to support biological methanation research  at Aarhus University, Denmark, which explores the production  of synthetic methane for storage in the existing gas grid."
10,Apple.pdf,"In  this process, bacteria consumes both hydrogen produced  from excess renewable energy and captured carbon dioxide  to produce methane, the principal component of natural gas."
10,Apple.pdf,"Methane produced from renewables is a versatile energy carrier  that can be used as a fuel source in households, industry,  and transportation."
10,Apple.pdf,"Below: In total, Apple- created renewable sources  account for 90 percent of  the renewable electricity our  facilities use, and include  wind projects in Viborg,  Denmark, and Prineville,  Oregon (pictured below)."
10,Apple.pdf,Some innovations are market-based.
10,Apple.pdf,"Outside of Fredricksburg,  Virginia, we’ve helped to realize a renewable energy aggregation  project, which brings together multiple buyers in a single energy  transaction."
10,Apple.pdf,"For this 165-megawatt project, we worked with our  partners Akamai, Swiss Re, and Etsy to help attain economies of  scale through our collective purchasing power."
10,Apple.pdf,"Advancing renewable energy through innovations In 2020, we’ve pursued innovations in how we create and  consume renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,We announced our investment in  the world’s largest onshore wind turbines.
10,Apple.pdf,"The Denmark-based  project, near the town Esbjerg, features two 200-meter-tall  turbines that are expected to produce 62 gigawatt-hours each  year—enough to power almost 20,000 homes."
10,Apple.pdf,"The power  produced onsite will support Apple’s data center in Viborg, with all  surplus energy going into the Danish grid."
10,Apple.pdf,The project will also act  as a test site for powerful offshore wind turbines.
10,Apple.pdf,Our agreement  to purchase the electricity at an established price has helped  make this effort financially viable as it comes online.
10,Apple.pdf,"Initial investment in the development  of nearly 500 megawatts of   solar and wind projects in China  and Japan to address upstream  emissions in our supply chain 
Supplier Code of Conduct  requires suppliers to maintain  an inventory of air emissions  including greenhouse gases 
Launch of the China  Clean Energy Fund,  which will enable Apple  and our suppliers to  invest in more than   1 gigawatt of renewable  energy in China 
More than   4 gigawatts of  renewable energy  brought online, and  nearly 8 gigawatts  of renewable energy  commitments reached 
Electricity usage in our supply chain is the single greatest  contributor to our carbon emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,"While this is a global issue,  the impact is also local."
10,Apple.pdf,"Bringing renewable energy online with  our suppliers and, where possible, displacing fossil fuels helps  decarbonize power grids and improves local air quality for  communities."
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why our efforts to enable our suppliers to  reduce energy use and transition to renewables are essential  to reaching our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality.
10,Apple.pdf,"This work  presents challenges: technical and regulatory barriers, capital  requirements, and lack of awareness on where to find and access  high-quality and cost-effective solutions."
10,Apple.pdf,Two initiatives drive our approach: our Supplier Energy Efficiency  Program and our Supplier Clean Energy Program.
10,Apple.pdf,These work  hand in hand to reduce the energy used in our supply chain  and transition the remaining energy to renewables.
10,Apple.pdf,We take  responsibility for our supply chain as part of our comprehensive  carbon footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"But we also know that we can achieve even  more significant climate impact by providing a model for other  companies to follow with their suppliers, helping to reduce  emissions beyond our industry."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve made tremendous progress toward our goal of  transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to 100 percent  renewable electricity by 2030.
10,Apple.pdf,"One important benchmark we’ve  achieved is our initial goal, set in 2015, of bringing online over  4 gigawatts of additional renewable energy to our supply chain— with additional supplier commitments bringing the total to nearly  8 gigawatts."
10,Apple.pdf,"The renewable energy already online generated  11.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy in fiscal year 2020,  avoiding 8.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions in our supply  chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"As of March 2021, 109 manufacturing partners in 24  different countries have committed to 100 percent renewable  energy for Apple production (see Appendix B)."
10,Apple.pdf,"And to cover  emissions even further upstream, Apple has invested directly in  nearly 500 megawatts of renewable energy projects."
10,Apple.pdf,"While we celebrate our transition to 100 percent renewable  energy at our facilities,17 we want to see a world in which  renewable energy is widely available and broadly used."
10,Apple.pdf,"Starting  with our suppliers, we aim to accelerate this change as we  support their transition to renewables."
10,Apple.pdf,Our own experience gives  us knowledge we can share.
10,Apple.pdf,"And we help break down barriers,  through innovative funding structures and by advocating for clean  energy–friendly policies."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, we received the RE100 award  for “best green catalyst” due to our work engaging our suppliers  on renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,Expanding renewable energy opportunities The transition to renewables means helping our suppliers find  energy solutions and make the right investments to address their  specific needs.
10,Apple.pdf,"When we face barriers to accessing cost-effective  clean energy, we innovate."
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why we developed the China  Clean Energy Fund.
10,Apple.pdf,"The fund enables Apple and our suppliers  to invest in clean energy—to date, these projects account for  134 megawatts in renewable power."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve also invested in  renewable energy solutions to cover upstream emissions in  our supply chain—playing a pivotal role in developing nearly  500 megawatts of solar and wind projects in China and Japan.
10,Apple.pdf,Galvanizing internal champions  Apple employees are passionate about the environment and  excited about our 2030 commitment.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re empowering  supplier-facing employees with the tools they need to support  our mission and speed a supplier’s transition to renewable energy.
10,Apple.pdf,It starts with data and transparency.
10,Apple.pdf,"We track the progress of  our suppliers, including those just beginning to learn about  renewables and others that are well on their way to 100 percent  renewable."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve also created internal trainings and crafted a  simple engagement process, backed by resources for both Apple  employees and our suppliers."
10,Apple.pdf,"By connecting our suppliers with  resources and helping them assess their performance, our teams  are scaling impact across our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,Supporting supplier capacity We share the experience gained through our own transition to  100 percent renewable energy with our suppliers.
10,Apple.pdf,We introduce  suppliers to resources and training materials with country-specific  information to guide them in their transition to renewables.
10,Apple.pdf,These  tools are available through our Supplier Clean Energy Portal.
10,Apple.pdf,We also educate suppliers through advanced and customized  training with leading experts.
10,Apple.pdf,And we support the creation and  growth of renewable energy industry associations that our  suppliers can join to learn about local opportunities.
10,Apple.pdf,"Long-standing energy structures can make it difficult to bring  new renewable energy online in some regions, prompting  some of our suppliers to maximize existing renewable energy  solutions—like onsite solar installations."
10,Apple.pdf,"Others have pioneered  new purchasing methods, creating renewable energy businesses  or even participating in some of the world’s largest and most  innovative renewable energy deals."
10,Apple.pdf,Advocating for policy change Government policies and rules can present some of the largest  barriers to transitioning to renewables.
10,Apple.pdf,"We lend our voice and  stand with other companies and NGOs to break down policy  barriers to achieve thriving clean energy markets with, for  example, enhanced grid resiliency and greater energy innovation."
10,Apple.pdf,"Across regions, we engage with policymakers to support  renewable energy that is cost-effective, accessible to companies,  and sourced from high-quality projects with a material impact on  local markets."
10,Apple.pdf,"For more information, jump to the section on our  climate policy engagements."
10,Apple.pdf,"In April 2019, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) adopted the  Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule,   which effectively repealed and replaced   the Clean Power Plan (CPP)."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple had previously voiced our support for the CPP because  it played an important role in allowing developers, utilities, and  financiers to invest in renewable energy with confidence, and  it incentivized utilities to provide corporate energy buyers like  Apple with increasing supplies of renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,The adoption  of the ACE Rule eliminated those incentives.
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple spoke out  on this issue, as we believed that the ACE Rule would reduce  access to renewable energy sources and drive up the cost of  renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C."
10,Apple.pdf,Circuit  held that the ACE Rule and its repeal of the Clean Power Plan  was inconsistent with the U.S. Clean Air Act.
10,Apple.pdf,"We anticipate new  challenges ahead, but our position on strong climate policy is clear:  Each one of us has a role to play in addressing the climate crisis."
10,Apple.pdf,"We undertake our advocacy—whether in pushing for more robust  policies or fighting to protect those already in place—because  it makes business sense for Apple and it is what our customers,  shareholders, and stakeholders expect of us."
10,Apple.pdf,Our collective action  on climate change is crucial for the planet and the long-term health  of our business.
10,Apple.pdf,1.
10,Apple.pdf,Set strong targets based on science.
10,Apple.pdf,Policymakers should  set national or regional targets that seek to limit warming to no  more than 1.5° Celsius.
10,Apple.pdf,These goals need to include interim  targets and mechanisms to enforce short-term accountability.
10,Apple.pdf,To meet these targets requires a price on carbon and parallel  participation in international policy negotiation.
10,Apple.pdf,2.
10,Apple.pdf,Create sector-specific policies.
10,Apple.pdf,Limiting warming to  1.5° Celsius is a goal that requires actions across the entire  economy.
10,Apple.pdf,Policies need to address sector-specific needs and  facilitate the transition to decarbonize industries where there  are challenges or there is a need for infrastructure to support  the goal.
10,Apple.pdf,3.
10,Apple.pdf,Support a green economy for all.
10,Apple.pdf,"Climate policies should  have positive, long-term fiscal impacts and support the  development of the new green economy, with job opportunities  focused on advancing clean innovation."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re pursuing clean energy policies in countries where we  operate.
10,Apple.pdf,"In Europe, Apple called on European leaders to increase  their climate ambition to achieve a target of at least 55 percent  of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieve climate  neutrality by 2050."
10,Apple.pdf,The EU—which adopted this standard in  December of 2020—serves as an example for how policy  ambition is crucial for climate progress and how companies like  Apple can play a role in showing how economic and climate  progress go hand in hand.
10,Apple.pdf,"Last year in Seoul, we hosted members of RE100, a global  initiative of some of the world’s most influential businesses  committed to 100 percent renewable electricity."
10,Apple.pdf,"In Vietnam,  we advocated for government action to enable companies  to purchase renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"Also, in Japan, we became  the first of several multinationals to join the Japan Climate  Leader’s Partnership, which aligns business objectives with  environmental goals."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our own goals show our commitment to these principles,   as our 2030 emissions reduction target aligns with the  actions needed to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius."
10,Apple.pdf,"As of December 2020,  our display suppliers  have installed mitigation  technologies to reduce  F-GHG emissions  associated with  producing all of our  display panels by more  than 90 percent on  average."
10,Apple.pdf,Some materials that are integral to our  products result in significant emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,The same is true for certain manufacturing  processes.
10,Apple.pdf,"To address these emissions we  seek technological solutions, either through  emissions abatement or switching to   low-carbon fuel options."
10,Apple.pdf,"Many Apple products utilize aluminum as a signature material— it is strong, durable, and enhances the longevity of devices."
10,Apple.pdf,"But,  the current smelting process for producing aluminum used by  manufacturers around the world is carbon-intensive."
10,Apple.pdf,"For the first  time, aluminum smelted with a direct emissions-free process is  being used in production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro."
10,Apple.pdf,"This innovation, called Elysis, is the result of a joint venture of  two aluminum manufacturers."
10,Apple.pdf,The venture aims to commercialize  patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas  emissions from the traditional smelting process.
10,Apple.pdf,This aligned with  our goals to reduce emissions associated with our products—and  to pursue innovations that can carry industry-wide impact.
10,Apple.pdf,Apple  and the governments of Canada and Quebec have joined with the  founders of Elysis to invest in research and development of the  technology.
10,Apple.pdf,Part of this funding is being used to construct a new  facility in Quebec.
10,Apple.pdf,"Once finished, this R&D facility will significantly  scale the carbon-free smelting technology, making this high- performance, low-emissions material available commercially."
10,Apple.pdf,"Many components essential to products like ours, including  integrated circuit (IC) chips and display panels, currently  rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent  these gases from being released into the atmosphere, where  they have high global warming potential."
10,Apple.pdf,"First, we encourage  suppliers to optimize manufacturing processes—reducing the  use of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHG) in the first place."
10,Apple.pdf,"Then we ask suppliers to deploy abatement technologies,  curtailing the release of emissions from the gases that remain."
10,Apple.pdf,"As of December 2020, our display suppliers have installed  mitigation technologies to reduce F-GHG emissions associated  with producing all of our display panels by more than 90 percent  on average."
10,Apple.pdf,"Since the launch of our efforts in 2019, our key  display suppliers have reduced the equivalent of more than  2,300,000 annualized metric tons of CO2e."
10,Apple.pdf,"Each year, we ship hundreds of millions of products from  our manufacturers to our consumers."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve approached  this process as we have other carbon emissions objectives.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re shifting toward less carbon-intensive shipping methods,  like rail and maritime carriers, where possible."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we’re seeking  out technical innovations, including alternative fuels and  electric vehicles."
10,Apple.pdf,"HomePod recently launched using lower-carbon forms of  transportation, significantly reducing emissions associated  with shipping."
10,Apple.pdf,"In Europe, we’re working with carriers who prioritize  “carbon neutral delivery” using electric vehicles, including e-bikes  and e-cars."
10,Apple.pdf,These innovations help reduce our impact in the  communities where our customers purchase our products.
10,Apple.pdf,"And by preferring vendors that offer low-carbon options, we  signal the value of these options to us and reward those driving  decarbonization in their industry."
10,Apple.pdf,We are also exploring ways to reduce our carbon footprint  from employee commuting.
10,Apple.pdf,Although the Covid-19 pandemic  significantly impacted the number of our employees commuting  to Apple facilities and retail stores—temporarily reducing our  carbon footprint—our strategy to reduce commuting-related  emissions looks beyond this to the long term.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our efforts  incorporate remote working through our At Home Advisor  program, while also transitioning away from single-occupancy  vehicles through mass transit, coach services, and campus  bicycles."
10,Apple.pdf,We also offer more than 2300 EV charging stations  across our U.S.-based campuses.
10,Apple.pdf,"In total, these initiatives  have helped us reduce our CO2e emissions by more than  16,000 metric tons in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through donations, Apple works with a diverse set of partners  to enhance environmental protections and support global  communities."
10,Apple.pdf,"For the launch of the Apple TV+ documentary,  The Elephant Queen, Apple partnered with Conservation  International and Save the Elephants to support community- based elephant conservation in Kenya—including improved  elephant tracking and the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary."
10,Apple.pdf,Apple also celebrated the 104th birthday of the national parks  with a donation to the National Park Foundation.
10,Apple.pdf,"With support  from Apple, the National Park Foundation’s youth programs  have given thousands of kids the chance to learn about and  experience the parks through school activities, trips, and service  corps programs."
10,Apple.pdf,These programs include efforts to bring youth  from underserved communities into the parks and recruit interns  from historically black colleges and universities.
10,Apple.pdf,Our goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2030  requires more than reducing emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"To address the emissions we can’t avoid for  the foreseeable future, we need to take active  steps to remove carbon dioxide from the  atmosphere."
10,Apple.pdf,This is a necessary complement  to our emissions reduction efforts—and an  essential pillar of our strategy.
10,Apple.pdf,The purpose of our carbon removal work is clear and urgent.
10,Apple.pdf,All global actors need to take immediate action to combat climate  change.
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why we’ve set our goal to reduce emissions by  75 percent by 2030.
10,Apple.pdf,And why we use the best tools available  today to remove the remainder of our emissions: nature- based solutions.
10,Apple.pdf,Nature provides some of the best tools to remove carbon from  the atmosphere.
10,Apple.pdf,"Forests, wetlands, and grasslands draw carbon  from the atmosphere and store it away in their soils, roots, and  branches."
10,Apple.pdf,"This approach not only is proven and scalable, but  also provides livelihoods for local communities and improves  ecosystems."
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why we’ve begun with nature-based carbon  removal solutions to support our goal of achieving carbon  neutrality across our full product life cycle by 2030.
10,Apple.pdf,"In developing our strategy, we recognize that forest restoration  and habitat protection don’t always have to be a cost, but can  represent an investment opportunity."
10,Apple.pdf,That is why we’re partnering  with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the  Restore Fund.
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple will invest up to US$200 million in projects  that aim to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere, all  while meeting clear social and environmental impact criteria and  offering a financial return."
10,Apple.pdf,How these investments will perform is of critical importance.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our partnership with Conservation International and Goldman  Sachs helps ensure the impact of investments, by seeking  out projects that meet the highest environmental and social  standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"The Restore Fund will align with international standards  developed by organizations such as Verra, the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change, and the UN Climate Convention, which  ensure that the carbon stored in forests is being conservatively  and accurately quantified, and is permanently locked out of  
the atmosphere."
10,Apple.pdf,We will also share our measurements through  international registries to ensure transparency and accuracy— and that any emissions savings aren’t counted twice.
10,Apple.pdf,This will also  involve close engagement with local and indigenous communities  to respect and protect their rights and livelihoods.
10,Apple.pdf,Our priorities  will focus on projects that protect lands with high conservation  values and that use native species to maintain and restore  biodiversity in the areas that we restore.
10,Apple.pdf,"To ensure the integrity  of these programs, we will work with independent auditors to  verify our impact."
10,Apple.pdf,"In its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goal of removing more  than 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year with impact  scaling up over time."
10,Apple.pdf,"By 2030, we aim to remove enough carbon  dioxide from the atmosphere to cover the residual emissions  that we are unable to avoid directly within our value chain."
10,Apple.pdf,This fund is unique because it changes carbon removal from  a cost to a profitable investment.
10,Apple.pdf,"Through creating a fund that  generates both a financial return as well as real and measurable  carbon impact, we aim to drive broader change in the future— encouraging capital investment in carbon removal around  the globe."
10,Apple.pdf,"Long-term carbon removal solutions, like the fund, will help us  reach neutrality for our end-to-end carbon footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"At the same  time, we are not waiting to address our corporate emissions in  the short term."
10,Apple.pdf,"As of April 2020, Apple has been carbon neutral  across all of our corporate emissions—including stores, data  centers, and corporate facilities—as well as business travel and  employee commuting."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve already addressed the vast majority  of our corporate emissions through renewable energy and  energy efficiency efforts.
10,Apple.pdf,"However, the carbon footprint of some  activities is difficult to avoid today—whether it is emissions from  the use of natural gas in some of our buildings or the emissions  from employee air travel."
10,Apple.pdf,"To address these emissions as the  Restore Fund comes online, we partnered with Conservation  International on projects that generate carbon credits to cover  our corporate footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"Above: Apple is partnering  with Conservation  International to invest in  Komaza, a responsible  “micro-forestry” company,  to help measure and value  the carbon removal impact  of its forestry work."
10,Apple.pdf,"Photo credit: Will Swanson,  courtesy of Komaza 
In Kilifi, Kenya, just south of the Arabuko  Sokoke National Reserve, a forestry business   is seeking to change the way commercial  forestry operates in this region of Africa."
10,Apple.pdf,Komaza is a “micro-forestry” company that partners with and  empowers tens of thousands of marginalized farmers to earn a  living from sustainable tree farming.
10,Apple.pdf,"The company works with  farmers from planting, to harvesting, to processing—supporting   an eight-year growth cycle to create responsible wood products."
10,Apple.pdf,There is an urgent need for the work that Komaza is doing.
10,Apple.pdf,"Across  Africa, the demand for wood has grown with rising populations in  tandem with rapid urbanization—at a rate that far exceeds what  the continent’s forests can provide."
10,Apple.pdf,"This has led to increased  deforestation and the cascading effects of damage to critical  ecosystems, including the loss of biodiversity and increased  carbon emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,"By blending sustainable practices with a  scalable approach to commercial forestry, Komaza is aiming to  reverse these impacts, while supporting the livelihood and   well-being of local communities."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple is partnering with Conservation International and Komaza  to invest in the micro-forestry model and its positive impacts on  carbon removal, biodiversity conservation, and socio-economic  development."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through our partnership, Conservation International  will help Komaza measure and value the carbon removal impact   of this forestry work to produce verified carbon credits."
10,Apple.pdf,"These efforts build on our history of work to protect and restore  critical ecosystems including forests, wetlands, and grasslands  around the world."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through our partnerships with World Wildlife  Fund and The Conservation Fund, we have protected or improved  the management of over 1 million acres of forests in China and the  U.S. And in 2018, we partnered with Conservation International,  INVEMAR Research Institute, and CVS (Corporación Autónoma  Regional del Valles del Sinú) to protect and restore 27,000 acres   of mangrove forest in Colombia."
10,Apple.pdf,Mangroves are critical  ecosystems at both the local and global scales.
10,Apple.pdf,"They fortify  coastlines, supporting local communities and their livelihoods."
10,Apple.pdf,And mangrove forests also sequester more than 10 times the  carbon than forests on land.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our partnership with Conservation  International was the first project to accurately capture the value  of this “blue carbon” and, for the first time in 2021, the project will  issue carbon credits that help to further conservation efforts in  the region."
10,Apple.pdf,We have also partnered with Conservation International in Kenya  to protect and restore savanna with the Maasai Wilderness  Conservation Trust and the Big Life Foundation in the iconic  Chyulu Hills region.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our funds will help to repair damage caused  by unsustainable land-use practices that degrade grasslands and  soils, endanger local wildlife, release carbon into the atmosphere,  and deprive local communities of vital agricultural resources."
10,Apple.pdf,Both the mangrove and savanna ecosystems have significant  carbon removal benefits—as well as offering an opportunity to  work with local partners to make a direct impact.
10,Apple.pdf,These solutions  complement our existing efforts to find efficiencies and reduce  the carbon footprint of our operations.
10,Apple.pdf,"As we work to maintain  our carbon neutrality each year, these projects represent an  investment in ecosystems that will last for generations."
10,Apple.pdf,"Last year, we made our most ambitious commitment yet—to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030."
10,Apple.pdf,The resources we  depend on to make our products have a significant impact on this goal.
10,Apple.pdf,"This is yet another reason to make the most of  the resources we use—through our work to one day make our products using only recycled and renewable materials,  to build long-lasting products with a lower carbon intensity, and to create recycling technologies to end our reliance on  carbon-intensive mining."
10,Apple.pdf,And all of these efforts also help conserve the earth’s finite resources.
10,Apple.pdf,We take responsibility for our relationship  with all of the resources that make our work  possible.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our efforts to responsibly source  materials, minimize water use, and eliminate  waste are directly connected to the creation  of our products—and span both our own  operations and those of our suppliers."
10,Apple.pdf,We start by looking at our products and the resources we use  to make them.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re moving toward a future where we build  products using only recycled and renewable materials, and  at the same time, implement low-carbon designs."
10,Apple.pdf,"We aim to  build durable, long-lasting products to make the best use of the  resources inside them."
10,Apple.pdf,"When a product is ready to be recycled,  we’re engaging partners and designing technologies to recover  raw materials for new products."
10,Apple.pdf,Water is another vital resource for our business.
10,Apple.pdf,"We rely on it to  manufacture products and run our offices, data centers, and  stores."
10,Apple.pdf,"That’s why we are optimizing our current use, leveraging  alternative and recycled sources of water, and managing our  discharge responsibly."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re working to eliminate landfill waste—to conserve the world’s  resources and protect those communities disproportionately  exposed to waste.
10,Apple.pdf,"We make progress by reducing the amount we  create, recycling wherever possible, and innovating opportunities  for reuse."
10,Apple.pdf,This is a collaborative effort.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our suppliers have the  greatest ability to help us conserve resources, to realize the  potential for recycling, and to lower our carbon footprint by  doing more with less."
10,Apple.pdf,"Materials  Transition to only recycled or renewable  materials in our products and packaging,  and maximize material efficiency, product  longevity, and recovery."
10,Apple.pdf,"Zero waste to landfill  Minimize overall waste generated and  eliminate waste sent to landfill from key  manufacturing facilities as well as corporate  offices, data centers, and retail stores."
10,Apple.pdf,"Water stewardship  Reduce freshwater use, transition to  alternative sources, improve the quality  of water we discharge, and protect  shared water resources."
10,Apple.pdf,Our products rely on the availability of   high-quality materials.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re increasingly  sourcing more of these valuable commodities  from circular supply chains, drawn from  recycled content and renewable resources."
10,Apple.pdf,Our goal is to one day achieve independence from mined  resources—those continually extracted from the earth in a  carbon-intensive process.
10,Apple.pdf,"As we progress toward this goal,  we’re doing so without sacrificing the quality and durability of  our products."
10,Apple.pdf,And we’re working on innovations in recycling to  enhance material recovery and support circular supply chains  for ourselves and others.
10,Apple.pdf,The scale of this challenge is significant.
10,Apple.pdf,But so is our potential  to have an impact.
10,Apple.pdf,"The changes that we push forward affect the  people who interact with our products, influence the markets  in which we operate, and create change for broader global  communities."
10,Apple.pdf,"Whether through technological innovation or by  achieving regulatory cooperation, our actions carry results that  extend beyond our business."
10,Apple.pdf,"• Sourcing and efficiency: Sourcing recycled and  renewable materials for our products and packaging,  and using these materials more efficiently."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we source  materials responsibly, whether from virgin, recycled, or  renewable sources."
10,Apple.pdf,• Product longevity: Making the most of the materials we use  through designing long-lasting products.
10,Apple.pdf,"We design durable  hardware, leverage software updates to extend functionality,  provide convenient access to repair services, refurbish  devices for their next user, and reuse parts with more to give."
10,Apple.pdf,"• Product end-of-life: Enhancing product collection and  recycling innovation, so we and others can use old devices  as raw material sources for the future."
10,Apple.pdf,"For the last few years, we’ve worked diligently  toward the goal of relying solely on recycled  and renewable materials for our products and  our packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve signaled to markets that we care about the source of our  materials—and seek those that can be used continually without  depleting the earth’s resources.
10,Apple.pdf,"Many partners have joined us in  these efforts, and we hope to engage others as we see a broader  global transition."
10,Apple.pdf,We continue to source materials responsibly and  use materials efficiently in the design of new products.
10,Apple.pdf,"Last year, we saw progress across materials—from expanding  our use of recycled aluminum enclosures to sourcing solder  made with recycled tin."
10,Apple.pdf,"In October, we introduced iPhone 12 and  iPhone 12 Pro, the first Apple products made with 99 percent  recycled tungsten and 98 percent recycled rare earth elements."
10,Apple.pdf,And we released seven products with more than 20 percent  recycled content.
10,Apple.pdf,"MacBook Air with Retina display (2020) had  the highest total—made with more than 40 percent recycled  content device-wide, including 100 percent recycled aluminum  in the enclosure."
10,Apple.pdf,These and other innovations helped us increase  our use of recycled or renewable content to 12 percent of all the  material used in products this year.
10,Apple.pdf,"And more than half of our  recycled materials have been third-party certified.20 
We continue to focus our efforts on our 14 priority materials,  which accounted for more than 90 percent of the total product  mass shipped to customers in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"We prioritized  these materials based on their environmental, social, and supply  impacts outlined in their Material Impact Profiles."
10,Apple.pdf,"This year, we  expanded the profiles to include a new indicator for biodiversity,  helping us assess the likelihood that a material may come from  critical habitats."
10,Apple.pdf,"We recognize that mining activities affect local  species and ecosystems, so with this and other information  captured in the profiles, we prioritize materials to switch to  recycled and renewable sources."
10,Apple.pdf,"At the same time, we’re adhering to rigorous sourcing  standards."
10,Apple.pdf,Our recycled and renewable material specifications  follow standards set out by the international community.
10,Apple.pdf,"To ensure that these materials meet our requirements, we  ask our suppliers for third-party certifications.21 This helps  us confirm a material has been recycled or comes from a  renewable source—one that can continually produce without  depleting the earth’s resources.22 As we introduce materials  from new sources, we continue to evaluate each for its  chemical safety."
10,Apple.pdf,"This allows us to scale our use of materials  that are better for the environment, while ensuring they are  also safe for use in our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"This diligence carries over to our efforts to source responsibly,  regardless of whether we are using virgin or recycled  materials."
10,Apple.pdf,This is a natural extension of our environmental  efforts—and it draws from the same reliance on international  standards.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our Responsible Sourcing Standards are based on  leading international guidance, including the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) due diligence guidance."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, 100 percent of the identified tin, tantalum, tungsten,  gold, cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners in Apple’s  supply chain participated in an independent third-party audit  program."
10,Apple.pdf,We also map and conduct additional diligence  on other materials in our products.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re partnering with  the smelters and refiners identified through this process  as we build supply chains for recycled material as well.
10,Apple.pdf,And we continue to engage with the Responsible Materials  Initiative—a multi-industry initiative focused on responsible  mineral sourcing issues—and other industry partners to  promote transparency across supply chains and to establish  additional auditing and due diligence systems.
10,Apple.pdf,Our efforts to use recycled and renewable materials also  support our climate goals.
10,Apple.pdf,"In most cases, the recycled  content has a lower carbon footprint than primary materials."
10,Apple.pdf,"As we continue to drive efficient, sustainable use of the  earth’s resources, we’re working with policymakers to  support international standards that enable the use of  these materials globally."
10,Apple.pdf,Apple is committed  to setting the highest  standards for responsible  sourcing of the  materials used in our  products.
10,Apple.pdf,"For more  information, read our  Supplier Responsibility  Report and our Conflict  Minerals Report on the  following site: Supplier  Responsibility."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re prioritizing  14 materials to   transition to   recycled and renewable  content:   Aluminum   Cobalt  Copper  Glass  Gold  Lithium  Paper  Plastics  Rare earth elements  Steel  Tantalum  Tin  Tungsten  Zinc
10,Apple.pdf,Found in products MacBook Air  MacBook Pro  27-inch iMac   Mac Pro   Pro Display XDR   Mac mini  iPad Pro   iPad Air  iPad  iPad mini   iPhone
10,Apple.pdf,The next part of the process was supply chain architecture: the  important task of getting the recycled raw material to our parts  suppliers.
10,Apple.pdf,"While tungsten is widely recycled, the streams come  from varied sources and are of differing qualities."
10,Apple.pdf,One challenge   is that tungsten used in industrial applications creates two   distinct types of scrap.
10,Apple.pdf,And we found through our testing that  only one—which goes through a more complicated recycling  process—could be used in our applications.
10,Apple.pdf,"Once this new supply chain was in place, we had established the  path to using 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine."
10,Apple.pdf,"And this transition creates impact—we will avoid using the  equivalent of an estimated 300,000 metric tons of mined material  by sourcing recycled tungsten for iPhone 12 and Apple Watch  Series 6."
10,Apple.pdf,Some of the impact of our work extends beyond  our own footprint as well.
10,Apple.pdf,"By building a supply chain solely for  recycled content, we helped advance the market for this recycled  material and further incentivize recovery across our industry."
10,Apple.pdf,Tungsten is one of the many materials that  help make Apple products come to life.
10,Apple.pdf,"It is  a key metal used in our Taptic Engine, which  gives devices like iPhone and Apple Watch  their unique feel through haptic feedback."
10,Apple.pdf,It is also a material we’ve prioritized as we  actively source recycled alternatives.
10,Apple.pdf,Last fall marked a significant achievement in our journey—we  released iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 6 with 100 percent  recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine.
10,Apple.pdf,"This meant we used  99 percent recycled tungsten in each device, and this marked   a first for a smartphone."
10,Apple.pdf,This achievement grew out of many years of work.
10,Apple.pdf,"We kicked  off this effort in 2016, in parallel with our goal of finding recycled  sources for metals like tin, by mapping the supply chain and  identifying available recycled content."
10,Apple.pdf,We eventually identified  a recycler that produced 100 percent recycled tungsten— showing us that our goal was possible.
10,Apple.pdf,"We continued to engage  suppliers to use the recycled material until we reached scale;  in some cases, working with suppliers to revamp their entire  manufacturing processes to focus only on recycled inputs."
10,Apple.pdf,Locating and sourcing recycled material was one element of the  process.
10,Apple.pdf,"The other, equally important task is to verify that this  resource will perform at the level required for our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"With  tungsten, we undertook more than a year of testing to determine  whether we could utilize the recycled material provided by the  new sources."
10,Apple.pdf,"Eventually, we determined that the recycled content  did meet our rigorous standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"Above: We use 100 percent  recycled tungsten in the  Taptic Engine of iPhone 12,  which represents 99 percent  of the total tungsten in   the device."
10,Apple.pdf,"The transition to recycled and  renewable resources presents  inherent challenges, as well as  opportunities."
10,Apple.pdf,"By engaging each,  we’ve made progress and gained  a clear understanding of the  task ahead."
10,Apple.pdf,"Regulatory barriers: Transboundary movement   regulations—originally intended to create environmental  protections—inadvertently inhibit the ability to recover   materials from scrap, end-of-life products, and parts for   use in new products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Contamination: The manner in which materials are recovered for  recycling can impact the composition of the material, reducing its  purity and usability."
10,Apple.pdf,Technical properties: Recycled or renewable material may   have unique technical properties that need to be accounted   for in product design.
10,Apple.pdf,"Availability: End-of-life products and industrial sources of scrap  for recycling may not be readily available, constraining the supply  of recycled material."
10,Apple.pdf,And the production of renewable material is  sometimes limited.
10,Apple.pdf,"Supply chains: Recycled or renewable content may not be easily  accessible on the market, requiring the development of new  supply chains."
10,Apple.pdf,"After creating a new aluminum alloy that incorporates recycled  content without compromising product performance, we’re now  scaling recycled content across products."
10,Apple.pdf,"We continue to use  100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of Apple Watch,  MacBook Air, and Mac mini, and expanded to iPad and iPad Air."
10,Apple.pdf,The transition to recycled aluminum also produced a significant  carbon savings—supporting our pursuit of low-carbon designs.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our recycled material comes from several sources, including  Apple’s manufacturing scrap and post-industrial sources."
10,Apple.pdf,"And in 2020, we expanded our sourcing of recycled aluminum  to include post-consumer scrap recovered from building and  construction projects."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve worked to increase our recycled cobalt year after year— doubling the amount of recycled material used in fiscal year 2020  from the previous year.
10,Apple.pdf,And the cobalt from iPhone batteries  disassembled by Daisy is being returned to the general market.
10,Apple.pdf,"This more efficient and economical approach makes the material  available to others beyond our supply chain, and continues to  create a positive environmental benefit."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re reducing the copper needed to build key components,  while also piloting the use of high quantities of recycled content."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re continuing to use foils that rely on less copper in our printed  circuit boards (PCBs), where we’ve also incorporated copper from  recycled sources."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re working to apply this same approach to  the foils we use in batteries and other modules.
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve worked to incorporate recycled content into the   material we use to produce glass parts—keeping glass at its  highest-purity use.
10,Apple.pdf,"As we collect and reuse scrap in new parts,  we use the material more efficiently."
10,Apple.pdf,And this year we used  recycled glass in multiple parts of our iPhone devices—including  the cover glass.
10,Apple.pdf,"We have looked to both increase the use of recycled content and  reduce the amount of gold required to make components, and at  the same time, we’re supporting greater transparency in global  supply chains."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve focused some of our reduction efforts on reassessing the  gold plating requirements in our components.
10,Apple.pdf,"Through this,   we were able to build the printed circuit board for iPhone 12   with 50 percent less gold plating than the prior generation."
10,Apple.pdf,We also continue to pursue the use of recycled material where  possible—including 100 percent certified recycled gold on the  plating of select circuit boards for iPhone.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re working to shift our use of virgin sources of lithium to  recycled materials recovered from batteries, as these options  become more viable and economical."
10,Apple.pdf,This involves testing to  ensure the recycled material meets our performance standards.
10,Apple.pdf,And we’re forging relationships with partners and recyclers  capable of bringing more of this material into the market.
10,Apple.pdf,Paper Packaging  Technical properties Progress toward our 2025 commitment to eliminate plastics  in packaging centers around switching to innovative fiber  replacements.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re expanding the number of products that use  fiber-based packaging and creating new fiber-based designs,  like the paper screen films on iPhone 12."
10,Apple.pdf,"As we use more fiber,  we continue to engage in circular supply chains that recycle and  regenerate fiber sources."
10,Apple.pdf,All of the wood fiber in our packaging  comes from recycled materials or responsibly managed forests.
10,Apple.pdf,And we’re upholding our commitment to protect or create  responsibly managed forests sufficient to cover the amount of  wood fiber we use in our packaging.
10,Apple.pdf,"By educating customers on  the recyclability of our packaging, we aim to contribute back to  the recycled material market as well."
10,Apple.pdf,"Plastics encompass a wide range of materials, and we’re  continuing to identify recycled plastics that meet our high  standards."
10,Apple.pdf,And we’re scaling the use of these materials across  our products.
10,Apple.pdf,"The mesh fabric of HomePod mini, for example,  is made with 90 percent recycled plastic."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we use 100  percent recycled polyester yarns in the Apple Watch Braided  Solo Loop.25 In total, we introduced more than 70 parts with an  average of 50 percent recycled plastic in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"And 17 additional components used plastics made from   bio-based content rather than fossil fuels, an important step   as we continue to pursue certified renewable plastic sources."
10,Apple.pdf,"After proving we could make a high-performance magnet using  only recycled rare earth elements, we’re focused on expanding  use across devices."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve successfully introduced recycled  rare earth magnets in several products this year including  Apple Watch, HomePod mini, iPad Air—and most notably,  iPhone including MagSafe accessories."
10,Apple.pdf,iPhone 12 uses the  highest concentration of any iPhone yet: 98 percent recycled  rare earth elements in the whole device.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also working to  reduce the total material used.
10,Apple.pdf,"By switching to a new cutting  technology, we reduced the rare earth elements needed to  manufacture MagSafe components by 12 percent."
10,Apple.pdf,"This year, we saw the results of our efforts to reduce the  total amount of steel in the iPhone 11 Pro enclosures, saving  nearly 10,000 metric tons of steel in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,And  we continued to improve steel efficiency in iPhone 12 Pro  manufacturing.
10,Apple.pdf,"This is an example of our low-carbon design  approach, which seeks to increase the use of recycled materials  and decrease the total amount of material required."
10,Apple.pdf,"Since   steel is highly recycled, our main focus is keeping it in the   highest-quality form possible."
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why we continue to  work to make sure high-purity steel gets recovered from our  manufacturing scrap and our products at end-of-life.
10,Apple.pdf,"While a market exists for recycled tantalum, we continue to  address the challenge of building new supply chains to provide  100 percent recycled content at the quality and scale we  need."
10,Apple.pdf,Recovery from end-of-life electronics remains an area of  opportunity that we’re actively investigating to develop further  use of this recycled material.
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, more than 25 percent of our tin came  from recycled sources as we continued to scale our use."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our  focus remains on its application in the solder of the main logic  boards of our iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and select Mac devices."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re also continuing to use recycled tin in our accessories,  including our power adapters and the Wireless Charging Case  for AirPods Pro."
10,Apple.pdf,And we introduced recycled tin solder on  the True Tone flash of iPad Pro and the wireless charger for  Apple Pencil as well.
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, we used 100 percent recycled tungsten in the   Taptic Engine of iPhone and Apple Watch for the first time,  which represents 99 percent of the total tungsten in the device."
10,Apple.pdf,"In total, more than 35 percent of the tungsten we used in fiscal  year 2020 came from recycled sources."
10,Apple.pdf,"And with the help of  our disassembly robots, Daisy and Dave, the tungsten from  our Taptic Engine can be recovered and recycled."
10,Apple.pdf,"We continue to work to identify high-quality sources of recycled  zinc, a challenge as the material is prone to accumulate  impurities during recycling."
10,Apple.pdf,"And each source we identify, we  rigorously test to ensure the recycled materials meet our high  performance standards."
10,Apple.pdf,Packaging fiber and plastic footprint* (metric tons)  We’ve reduced plastic in our packaging by 65 percent since 2015.
10,Apple.pdf,"And since 2017,   100 percent of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources."
10,Apple.pdf,The final step in the iPhone unboxing  process—peeling back the protective film  covering the screen—marks the moment  when the device is ready to be used.
10,Apple.pdf,"This year,  iPhone 12 owners will notice something new  when they unbox their devices."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve replaced the traditional transparent protective plastic  film with a paper alternative.
10,Apple.pdf,"It’s a small detail, but part of our  larger goal to eliminate all plastics in our packaging by 2025."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve made significant progress toward this goal since 2015,  replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with  fiber alternatives."
10,Apple.pdf,"These changes have allowed us to drastically  cut plastic use, including an 80 percent reduction in plastic  packaging in the 16-inch MacBook Pro."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, all  newly released iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook devices  shipped in packaging made with more than 90 percent fiber."
10,Apple.pdf,"Now we’re focusing on the detailed work of addressing the  smaller, but no less significant, uses of plastic."
10,Apple.pdf,"The pouch  enclosing Apple Watch, for example, is made from paper,  as are the folded wraps securing cables for iPad, iPhone,  AirPods, and MacBook."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we supply the wood fiber for  all of our packaging from recycled sources or responsibly  managed forests.26 
We’ve set these goals as part of our broader strategy to reduce  waste through eliminating single-use plastics and focusing on  recycled and renewable materials in our products and packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,"And as countries around the world adopt regulatory efforts with  similar goals, we find ourselves ahead of the curve in meeting new  requirements."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, our transition to paper bags in our  retail stores anticipated local regulations on plastic bags in select  regions."
10,Apple.pdf,"As countries from Argentina to Spain consider regulations  to reduce waste, we also advocate for action that promotes the  efficient use of low-impact materials, reduces single-use plastics,  and encourages requirements that consider the entire packaging  life cycle."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our ability to proactively meet new standards not only serves the  environment, it makes business sense."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re able to tackle design,  sourcing, and logistical challenges thoughtfully and in alignment  with all of our goals and efforts."
10,Apple.pdf,"This includes our commitment  to using responsibly sourced wood fiber while, at the same time,  contributing to the global supply of these responsible materials."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through partnerships with The Conservation Fund and the World  Wildlife Fund, we’ve protected more than 1 million acres of working  forests in the U.S. and China."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, these forests  generated enough responsibly sourced fiber to balance all the   fiber used in our packaging.27  
Our white paper on   Apple’s Paper and   Packaging Strategy   (PDF) details our   approach toward  creating responsibly  designed and sourced  packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,*  These data include the materials used in our packaging.
10,Apple.pdf,Fiber used at our corporate facilities represents less than 1 percent of our overall fiber use.
10,Apple.pdf,"** Since 2017, all of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources."
10,Apple.pdf,Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in   Apple’s Sustainable Fiber Specification (PDF).
10,Apple.pdf,We consider wood fibers to include bamboo.
10,Apple.pdf,"*  iPhone X and iPhone 12 models are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions."
10,Apple.pdf,iPhone X has a rating of IP67 under IEC standard  60529 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes).
10,Apple.pdf,iPhone 12 has a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes).
10,Apple.pdf,"Splash, water,  and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear."
10,Apple.pdf,Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for  cleaning and drying instructions.
10,Apple.pdf,Liquid damage not covered under warranty.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our customers expect their devices to be ready when they  need them, with minimal interruption for maintenance or repair."
10,Apple.pdf,We believe designing long-lasting products encourages our  customers to come back to Apple for their next one.
10,Apple.pdf,"And by  encouraging our customers to access the value of their current  device through Apple Trade In or third-party trade-in platforms,  not only are we making their next purchase more affordable—we  are also enabling a new customer to experience Apple products  and services."
10,Apple.pdf,And this approach is good for the planet.
10,Apple.pdf,Keeping a  product in use as long as possible—whether for one customer or  more over the course of the product’s life—enables us to get the  most out of the resources used to build the product.
10,Apple.pdf,"Because our design process prioritizes longevity, iPhone devices  hold their value for longer than the competition."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple delivers  on our commitment to provide long-lasting devices by building  durable hardware designed to endure the rigors of everyday  use, offering years of software updates to unlock new features  and functionality, and providing convenient access to safe and  reliable repair services for whenever they might be needed."
10,Apple.pdf,"We  aim to support the broadest range of devices possible so more  customers can benefit from advances in software, whether  their device is new or several generations older."
10,Apple.pdf,"We also strive  to continuously improve durability with every generation of a  product by delivering features that minimize the need for repair,  such as water resistance and better drop performance."
10,Apple.pdf,And we’re  improving the repairability of devices and expanding options
10,Apple.pdf,Above: A solar test replicates  and accelerates the UV  exposure a product would  experience by a window or in  full sunlight over its lifetime.
10,Apple.pdf,"With each new product, we strive to improve on the durability of  the prior generation."
10,Apple.pdf,"Last fall, we released iPhone 12 with Ceramic  Shield, a transparent ceramic cover glass that has four times  better drop performance than the previous generation.28  It is an innovation that contributes to the durability of each device,  minimizes the need for replacement parts, and helps retain  product value that customers can access through trade in."
10,Apple.pdf,This  advancement enhances durability alongside features like the IP68  water resistance of iPhone 12.29 And each improvement we make  is one more step in our ongoing journey to creating even more  durable products.
10,Apple.pdf,for repair around the world—including to independent repair  businesses—so our customers can access repair services should  they need it.
10,Apple.pdf,"Put together, it’s no surprise that our active installed  base of products grew to 1.65 billion devices in the last year."
10,Apple.pdf,We design for durability because long-lasting products that  minimize repair or replacement make for a better customer  experience.
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple products are designed to endure daily life, and  an essential element of the product experience is confidence in  the reliability of the device."
10,Apple.pdf,"This work involves developing innovative designs that are  engineered to withstand rigorous conditions, coupled with  testing to assess them against our strict durability standards."
10,Apple.pdf,We set these standards according to in-depth user studies  to understand how our customers use—and misuse—their  products.
10,Apple.pdf,"To measure against these requirements, we design  custom test methods to better simulate real-world   conditions—like an accidental drop."
10,Apple.pdf,"During each product’s development, thousands of units are  tested, and each test informs the next round of design."
10,Apple.pdf,"Engineers  in our Reliability Testing Lab measure the performance of  materials, components, and fully assembled products to ensure  every aspect of our product is thoroughly assessed for durability."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, Apple Watch prototypes are exposed to different  liquids like pool water, ocean water, and synthetic sweat to make  sure devices are ready to be used during exercise."
10,Apple.pdf,"With our drop  tower, we let products fall from dozens of different heights and  angles onto a range of surfaces to improve their resilience to an  accidental drop."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we test recycled or renewable materials to  the same performance standards as other materials—making  sure our products stay as durable as ever, even as we explore  new material sources."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through our iterative testing approach, we  continuously improve designs until they meet our strict standards  and are ready to face the world."
10,Apple.pdf,We design our products for durability in order to minimize the  need for repair.
10,Apple.pdf,"But in the instance a repair is needed, we believe  our customers should have convenient access to safe and  reliable repair services, to get their product back up and running  as quickly as possible."
10,Apple.pdf,We are continuing to broaden the availability of repair services  around the world.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our customers can receive repair with genuine  parts, whether they go to an Apple Store, Apple Authorized  Service Provider (AASP), participating Independent Repair  Provider, mail-in repair center, or receive onsite service."
10,Apple.pdf,We have grown our network to over 5000 AASP locations and  over 1500 Independent Repair Providers around the world.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our Independent Repair Provider program, now in its second year,  is designed to enable independent repair businesses—large and  small—to have access to Apple genuine parts, tools, diagnostics,  and training."
10,Apple.pdf,"The program underwent two major changes in  2020: expansion to Europe and Canada, and inclusion of Mac  repair in addition to iPhone repair."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re also increasing coverage  for onsite service options in select cities across the United States,  providing the ultimate convenience to our customers."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we’ve  trained more than 265,000 repair technicians to provide quality  repair support."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also improving the repairability of many  of our products.
10,Apple.pdf,"The new iPhone 12 design, for example, allows  for more repairs to be performed at more repair locations than  ever before."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re constantly working to improve the convenience of our  repair services as well as the durability of our devices.
10,Apple.pdf,And   we know there’s more work to be done on this journey.
10,Apple.pdf,Product longevity relies as much on software support as it does  on durable hardware design.
10,Apple.pdf,Our customers expect us to deliver  the latest software features and security updates to their existing  devices for years.
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why we work to continually improve the  operating systems that power our products.
10,Apple.pdf,We engineer each  software release to make sure it runs beautifully on all supported  devices.
10,Apple.pdf,"This helps us maximize the number of customers who  benefit from the latest software updates, regardless of whether  their device is brand new or several generations older."
10,Apple.pdf,"iOS 14, our most recent release, extends support back to  iPhone 6s (2015)."
10,Apple.pdf,iPadOS 14 compatibility goes back to iPad Air 2  (2014) and macOS Big Sur supports MacBook models from  2013 onward.
10,Apple.pdf,"The updates in each operating system make the  latest capabilities—from widgets on iPhone to the latest macOS  design—available to a broad user base, keeping their devices up  to date and extending their usability."
10,Apple.pdf,These updates also ensure  that more customers have access to the newest security and  privacy features available.
10,Apple.pdf,Many of our customers are eager to use these updates.
10,Apple.pdf,"By February 2021, 86 percent of all iPhone devices introduced  in the last four years had updated to iOS 14."
10,Apple.pdf,And iPadOS 14 was  being used on 84 percent of devices released in the last four  years.
10,Apple.pdf,Our continually high rates of adoption show that   our customers value these software updates.
10,Apple.pdf,Products that last longer make the best use of the resources  we rely on to create them.
10,Apple.pdf,"By finding ways to refurbish and  reuse these products, we can lower each device’s impact on the  environment—including their carbon intensity per year of life."
10,Apple.pdf,"And by building our products to serve more than one owner and  encouraging customers to exchange devices for an upgrade, we  extend the life of our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"We collect devices for refurbishing through a number of programs  including Apple Trade In, the iPhone Upgrade Program, AppleCare,  and our corporate Hardware Reuse Program."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020,  we sent 10.4 million devices to be refurbished for new users."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve also expanded our Trade In program to 25 countries, to  make this program as convenient and accessible as possible to  our customers."
10,Apple.pdf,Our customers drive the success of our trade-in programs and  those of third parties.
10,Apple.pdf,"Whether through trading in their devices,  passing down their device to a family member, or purchasing  refurbished products, their actions recognize the long-term  value we’ve designed and built into our products."
10,Apple.pdf,And it enables  us to make progress toward our goals of reducing our overall  environmental footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"After extending the life of devices for as long as possible, we aim  to do the same for the parts inside."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through recovery and reuse  of components from products at end-of-life, we can realize their  potential—either using them for replacement parts or in new  creative applications."
10,Apple.pdf,"By extending their use as long as possible,  we’re making the most of the materials and energy needed to  build them in the first place."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve expanded our efforts to recover more parts from   end-of-life devices for reuse.
10,Apple.pdf,Those parts that can be refurbished  to our high quality and performance standards can be reused  as replacements.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re then able to repair more devices while  creating fewer spare parts.
10,Apple.pdf,Our teams continue to look for  innovative opportunities to reuse accessories sent for recycling as  well.
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, we send collected power cables and adapters  to our final assembly sites, where they power production lines."
10,Apple.pdf,Visit our Certified  Refurbished site where  we offer like-new products  backed by a one-year  warranty and the Apple  Certified Refurbished  promise.30
10,Apple.pdf,Our responsibility for our products begins with  the design process and carries through end- of-life.
10,Apple.pdf,"While we first look for opportunities  for reuse, a product or part that no longer  functions as intended can still be a source  of valuable materials."
10,Apple.pdf,Through recycling we can realize the potential of these sources.
10,Apple.pdf,"And by keeping materials in the highest-quality form possible,  we can reduce the energy needed to manufacture new products,  driving down emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,It is through this outlook on the end- of-life of our products that we can design and build the next  generation of devices even better for our planet.
10,Apple.pdf,Our approach toward creating circular supply chains rests on  how well we recycle our products.
10,Apple.pdf,Making recycling options  easy and accessible is key to these efforts.
10,Apple.pdf,"At our retail locations,  our customers not only can experience and purchase our latest  products, but also can recycle devices they’re no longer using."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through both retail and online platforms like Trade In, we continue  to provide product take-back and recycling collection programs  in 99 percent of the countries where we sell products."
10,Apple.pdf,"These  programs allowed us to direct more than 39,000 metric tons of  e-waste to recycling globally in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"To do this, we seek out and partner with recyclers who are  the best-in-class, those who show high recovery rates and  can uphold our standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"To ensure the effectiveness of  these partnerships, we audit our recyclers for compliance with  environmental, health, and safety regulations, and encourage best  practices."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, we conducted more than 50 audits  globally—and we performed additional audits relating to security."
10,Apple.pdf,"And all of our recyclers in North America are either e-Stewards or  R2 certified, the electronics industry’s leading certifications."
10,Apple.pdf,We also partner with recyclers to make sure there is a recycling  solution for each Apple product.
10,Apple.pdf,This is a collaborative effort.
10,Apple.pdf,"Through training and ongoing support, we help our recycling  partners develop the ability to disassemble our products,  recovering as much material as possible while limiting waste."
10,Apple.pdf,"This year, we’ve also launched new Apple Recycler Guides  to provide guidance for professional electronics recyclers on  how to safely disassemble Apple products—and maximize  recovery of resources."
10,Apple.pdf,"The guides provide valuable insight on the  steps for recycling, as well as the recommended downstream  material recycler for the disassembled parts."
10,Apple.pdf,"Launched with  our Pro Display XDR, these efforts will continue to expand to  other products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Product by product, this has a cumulative effect."
10,Apple.pdf,"As we continue  to improve material recovery, we’re making sure more high-quality  recycled content is available on the market for us and others  to use."
10,Apple.pdf,Disassembling a product for recycling presents an inherent  challenge: What is the best way to minimize waste and maximize  recovery?
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve approached this challenge at our Material  Recovery Lab (MRL) based in Austin, Texas, where our team  works on developing better, more efficient recycling technologies."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, our engineers worked virtually with this year’s class of  MRL interns from universities across the U.S. and Canada to  innovate new approaches to disassembly."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve continued to build upon our recycling innovations.
10,Apple.pdf,"Dave,  our newest recycling robot, disassembles the Taptic Engine from  iPhone to enable the recovery of key materials such as rare earth  magnets, tungsten, and steel."
10,Apple.pdf,"And, we’re exploring new ways  to expand these recovery capabilities to other products."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re  also designing, developing, and testing additional disassembly  tools—including new methods for recovering materials from  Apple Pencil."
10,Apple.pdf,"And Daisy, our first disassembly robot, continues  to disassemble iPhone devices so recyclers can recover more  material inside."
10,Apple.pdf,"Just one metric ton of iPhone main logic boards,  flexes, and camera modules disassembled by Daisy contain the  same amount of gold and copper as an estimated 150 metric  tons of mined earth."
10,Apple.pdf,"These materials make it back to the general  market, so that we and others can use recycled materials for the  next generation of products."
10,Apple.pdf,"We support The  Recycling Partnership,  a U.S. nonprofit, in  their efforts to improve  residential recycling  across the country."
10,Apple.pdf,"In  2020, The Partnership  developed a first-of-its- kind national recycling  database that covers  97 percent of the U.S.  population, providing  real-time insights on what  materials are recyclable  locally."
10,Apple.pdf,The Recycling  Partnership also  developed a free best  practice management  guide and tools for  communities to use   for better disposal   of e-waste and   lithium-ion batteries.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also taking a long-term approach to recycling innovation.
10,Apple.pdf,"While our current technologies for recovering valuable materials  continue to improve, we recognize that new and emerging  technologies represent some of the best opportunities to impact  the future."
10,Apple.pdf,And that our investments in research and development  can yield transformative change.
10,Apple.pdf,That’s why we’re supporting  research initiatives that fundamentally reimagine disassembly  and recovery.
10,Apple.pdf,Our recently completed project with Carnegie Mellon University’s  Biorobotics Lab developed machine learning models to enable  better sorting of e-waste at recyclers.
10,Apple.pdf,"These software models,  which learn from different images of devices, aim to provide the  next generation of robots with the intelligence to disassemble  devices they’ve never seen before."
10,Apple.pdf,"Typically a model requires a  large amount of data—in this case, images of an object—to be  able to recognize that object for recycling."
10,Apple.pdf,"Unfortunately, this  data is not readily available."
10,Apple.pdf,"This research applies the concept  
Carnegie Mellon University is excited to work  with Apple in developing key robotics and  artificial intelligence technologies   to advance electronics recycling."
10,Apple.pdf,Apple   is the ideal partner for their combination  of real-world experience and technical  expertise—and they are engaged at every  stage of the project.
10,Apple.pdf,"Research like this   aims to apply the latest technology to   create industry-wide change.” 
Left: Dave, our newest  recycling robot, disassembles  the Taptic Engine from  iPhone to better recover key  materials such as rare earth  magnets, tungsten, and steel."
10,Apple.pdf,"of domain randomization, by synthetically creating the data real  images would provide, to grant robots the ability to recognize a  broad, varied stream of e-waste for recycling at scale."
10,Apple.pdf,"The newly  developed software will be open-sourced, available to be used by  others in new applications throughout the recycling industry."
10,Apple.pdf,The event drew representatives of 193 nations and  nongovernmental stakeholders from across the globe.
10,Apple.pdf,Apple  was there as well.
10,Apple.pdf,"While much of our resource work centers on  innovating technical solutions to enable circular supply chains  around our products, there’s another equally important task:  advocating for the policies that support resource recovery and  reuse."
10,Apple.pdf,Our engagement with the U.N.
10,Apple.pdf,"Environment Assembly  and other organizations, including the World Circular Economy  Forum, and Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy where  we serve on the board, furthers this goal."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re committed to  turning these important conversations into actions, and realizing  the benefits to the environment from our preliminary successes  across our entire supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"And just as policies can support these efforts, they can also  present unintended obstacles."
10,Apple.pdf,"We learned this through our  experience with iPhone, where we’ve had considerable success  recovering and recycling material from our devices."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example,  the same amount of gold and copper can be recovered from one  metric ton of end-of-life iPhone modules as can be extracted  from 150 metric tons of mined earth."
10,Apple.pdf,"That same material was categorized as hazardous waste under  some regulations, making it difficult to ship and then return  parts to the supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,Those regulations exist to provide an  essential protection—ensuring that vulnerable communities are  protected from global waste streams.
10,Apple.pdf,"Yet we believe there is an  opportunity to adjust policies to reinforce critical protections for  these communities, while also facilitating circular supply chains  that benefit the environment."
10,Apple.pdf,Apple is engaging in a dialogue with a diverse set of stakeholders  to find a novel solution to this challenge.
10,Apple.pdf,We believe that countries  should have the agency to opt-in to expedite the efficient  movement of regulated materials for circular supply chains.
10,Apple.pdf,But  that they should do so in a manner that enables the traceable and  responsible movement of recoverable material to preapproved  facilities with sound social and environmental practices.
10,Apple.pdf,"This is  aligned with the objectives of the Basel Convention and maintains  strong protections against the illegal movement of waste, while  streamlining shipments to responsible recyclers to allow for  circular supply chains to compete with extractive ones."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re  open to engaging with and learning from thought leaders who  also believe both objectives are possible.
10,Apple.pdf,"Below: In the hands of the  right recycler, iPhone devices  disassembled by Daisy can  be a valuable source of key  materials like gold, copper,  and aluminum."
10,Apple.pdf,Freshwater resources are increasingly scarce and vulnerable  to the effects of climate change.
10,Apple.pdf,"As a community resource,  water is shared by people and ecosystems across very different  environments."
10,Apple.pdf,Our efforts to reduce our freshwater withdrawals  and return clean water back to the watersheds in which we  operate reflect our commitment to managing this shared  resource responsibly.
10,Apple.pdf,We apply a context-based approach to water stewardship.
10,Apple.pdf,The  foundation of this is a clear understanding of our local footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"At our own facilities, we measure and continually monitor our  usage, and at our suppliers’ sites, we survey and model each  facility’s impact."
10,Apple.pdf,This process involves understanding how we   use water and how discharge should be handled at each site.
10,Apple.pdf,Each area has unique water conditions.
10,Apple.pdf,Tools like the World  Wildlife Fund (WWF) Risk Filter and the World Resources  Institute (WRI) Water Risk Atlas provide us detailed profiles of  geographically specific water consumption and water-related  risks that inform our local strategy.
10,Apple.pdf,We prioritize those areas  with high water risk—where approximately 46 percent of our  corporate water use occurs.32 Our strategy goes further to  proactively address areas of medium risk as well.
10,Apple.pdf,"This year, we’ve adopted a new approach to estimate water use in  the far reaches of our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,The data we model combines  water survey data collected from more than 1200 direct suppliers  with an advanced life cycle assessment model for more accurate  estimate of upstream water use.
10,Apple.pdf,"Though it is not common in our  industry to consider the impact of the activities of these upstream  suppliers, we believe it is essential to addressing our holistic  water footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites  and of our suppliers’ sites focus on the following key efforts:  
As our facilities and activities grow, we’re working to address  the challenges of water usage and efficiency."
10,Apple.pdf,We prioritize  regions with high water risk and focus our efforts on reducing the  amount we use.
10,Apple.pdf,"This is site-specific work as we and our suppliers  optimize water use for sanitation, climate control, maintaining  green spaces, or manufacturing."
10,Apple.pdf,And we recognize we have  progress yet to make.
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, our facilities used 1.29 billion gallons of  water, about 54 percent of which we discharged back into the  watershed for use by others.33 We saved 111 million gallons of  freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented  since 2017, including 11 million gallons due to new improvements  made this year.34 This progress underscores our commitment to  reducing water use."
10,Apple.pdf,Behind these numbers are local initiatives.
10,Apple.pdf,"At our Mesa, Arizona,  data center, our efforts to upgrade infrastructure and address  inefficiencies yielded an improvement in water use efficiency."
10,Apple.pdf,"At  one of our locations in Santa Clara Valley, equipment upgrades— including an improved cooling system—resulted in almost  1 million gallons of water savings per year."
10,Apple.pdf,"While we continue to focus on our corporate water use, we  recognize that far more water is used within our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"As we develop our capabilities to model this usage, we find  opportunities for water savings across locations."
10,Apple.pdf,"This requires  engagement with our manufacturers, who can work with our  supplier Clean Water program to access assessment tools  and technical guidance needed to make improvements."
10,Apple.pdf,"Some  efforts require little investment, like employee education on more  efficient rinsing processes."
10,Apple.pdf,"Others require upgrades to water- efficient equipment and wastewater reclamation systems, as  well as redesigning manufacturing locations."
10,Apple.pdf,We partner with our  suppliers on solutions that can yield efficiencies and impact our  overall usage.
10,Apple.pdf,The more than 172 suppliers in our Clean Water program have  already demonstrated savings from these initiatives.
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, they  saved 10.8 billion gallons of water, for a total of 41 billion gallons of  water savings since the launch of the program in 2013."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re focused on reducing our reliance on freshwater sources.
10,Apple.pdf,"The more we leverage alternative sources of water at each of  our locations, the less impact we’ll have on the local watershed."
10,Apple.pdf,"These potential alternative water sources include recycled water,  reclaimed water, rainwater, and condensate."
10,Apple.pdf,"Last year, alternative water sources accounted for 9 percent  of our total corporate water usage."
10,Apple.pdf,"At Apple locations in Texas,  North Carolina, Ireland, and Japan, we utilized rainwater capture  systems to source 5 million gallons of water."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also piloting  advanced water recovery systems.
10,Apple.pdf,"In Santa Clara Valley, we  installed a 1200-gallon condensate recovery system to collect  water produced as a by-product of cooling and air conditioning  systems."
10,Apple.pdf,"This not only diverts water away from the local  wastewater system, it also creates an onsite source of   high-quality water reused directly for irrigation."
10,Apple.pdf,"Water use at corporate facilities We track our corporate water use for our data centers,   retail stores, and corporate offices."
10,Apple.pdf,"*  We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority   of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent   comes from groundwater."
10,Apple.pdf,** Recycled water represents a key alternative water source.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our recycled water comes primarily from municipal treatment plants,   with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment."
10,Apple.pdf,"Recycled water is primarily  used for irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing."
10,Apple.pdf,Our suppliers are also implementing freshwater alternatives.
10,Apple.pdf,"In some cases, these require a change of process to allow water  to be reused onsite."
10,Apple.pdf,"In other instances, suppliers have installed  advanced systems to clean and recycle water to allow it to  be used again."
10,Apple.pdf,The suppliers within our Clean Water program  reused on average 40 percent of wastewater in 2020.
10,Apple.pdf,Water is a community resource.
10,Apple.pdf,We take seriously our  responsibility for both the quantity and the quality of water  we return to the watershed.
10,Apple.pdf,"For our corporate locations, we  estimate that 54 percent of the water we use is discharged into  the watershed for use by others.35 We ask our suppliers to do  their part as well, by adhering to the high standards for water  discharge outlined in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct."
10,Apple.pdf,"We  aim to do more than comply with local regulations governing  water discharge, whether at our facilities or our suppliers."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re committed to preserving the health of each local watershed  where we operate.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our Prineville, Oregon, data center was the  first Apple-owned or operated site—and the first data center  worldwide—to achieve certification under the Alliance for Water  Stewardship (AWS), demonstrating our commitment to   
context-based sustainable water use in the watershed."
10,Apple.pdf,"And  also in Prineville, we partnered with the city to create an aquifer  storage and recovery system, which will achieve commercial  operation in 2021."
10,Apple.pdf,"This aquifer will hold up to 180 million gallons  of water for use in peak months, reducing pressure on the  local watershed."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through the Clean Water program, we encourage performance  that goes far beyond compliance."
10,Apple.pdf,"To date, 13 facilities have  received certification of which 10 were Platinum status, the  highest level of recognition by AWS."
10,Apple.pdf,We are working with AWS  and WWF China to manage the Water Stewardship China  Network (WSCN).
10,Apple.pdf,"WSCN includes nearly 50 companies, local  government, and civil society organizations collaborating to  drive shared solutions at the basin-level and adoption of the  AWS Standard in high-risk areas."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, we worked with  AWS and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to establish  the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) water  stewardship working group."
10,Apple.pdf,"This group will promote the adoption  of water stewardship practices throughout the industry, by  developing training materials and providing opportunities  for sharing knowledge and best practices."
10,Apple.pdf,Our Prineville data  center is the first Apple  facility to receive TRUE  certification—meaning  more than 90 percent  of its waste is sent to  recycling or composting.
10,Apple.pdf,"This effort takes into account all materials, from kitchenware   to construction materials."
10,Apple.pdf,"And we’re working with our suppliers  to eliminate waste from manufacturing, so that we leave no  waste behind in the communities where our products are made."
10,Apple.pdf,Countless innovations support this effort—it is our job to rethink  how we do our work to achieve it.
10,Apple.pdf,The goal to preserve resources  is just one factor driving our efforts.
10,Apple.pdf,This work also protects  the most vulnerable communities disproportionately exposed  to waste.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re working to reduce and divert the waste created from  our business, whether from our offices, data centers, or retail  stores."
10,Apple.pdf,This effort is part of our goal to send zero waste to landfill.
10,Apple.pdf,"Since our Zero Waste Program launched in 2018, our major U.S.  campuses and global retail stores have been our focus."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, we diverted more than 70 percent of our  waste to recycling or composting rather than landfill.36 And we are  excited to announce our Prineville data center is the first Apple  facility to have received TRUE certification—meaning more than  90 percent of its waste is sent to recycling or composting.37 We  achieved this by partnering with local businesses to divert our  compost and plastics, by upgrading our infrastructure to allow for  better waste separation, and by switching to reusable alternatives  from single-use materials."
10,Apple.pdf,"These high diversion rates helped limit the amount of waste sent  to landfill to about 12,000 metric tons for our global operations.38  This was a reduction compared to the previous year, resulting in  part from the temporary closure of stores and offices due to the  Covid-19 pandemic."
10,Apple.pdf,"However, our zero waste initiatives helped  reduce waste at data centers and other locations that continued  to operate."
10,Apple.pdf,"Wherever possible, our aim is to minimize waste created in the  first place."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re working with our key suppliers to transition to  bulk, recyclable, or reusable packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,"At our Prineville data  center, we switched to reusable crates, pallets, and racks to safely  ship equipment."
10,Apple.pdf,This decreased a key stream of waste coming  to the site and reduced disposal costs as well.
10,Apple.pdf,"The waste we can’t avoid, we work to divert from landfill."
10,Apple.pdf,This  starts with building the right infrastructure and enhancing  messaging to ensure items end up in the correct bin.
10,Apple.pdf,"We are  rolling out consolidated bins for recycling, composting, and  landfill, and improved signage to reduce contamination and  increase recycling rates."
10,Apple.pdf,"The majority of our corporate sites  and retail stores worldwide recycle paper, plastic, aluminum, and  cardboard materials."
10,Apple.pdf,And more than 450 of our offices and retail  stores across North America participate in composting as well.
10,Apple.pdf,Yet our work continues to evolve as waste streams do.
10,Apple.pdf,"The health  of employees, customers, and communities is our first priority;   so we’ve supported our employees to wear all necessary personal  protective equipment for the Covid-19 pandemic."
10,Apple.pdf,"We rapidly  developed waste diversion options including a waste-to-energy  solution for face masks and gloves used in our offices in the   Santa Clara Valley and at more than 250 retail locations in the  United States.39 
We maintain our commitment to the safe and responsible  management of hazardous waste, both onsite and offsite."
10,Apple.pdf,"The Treatment, Storage, and Disposal facilities (TSDFs)  we work with are audited to ensure that the waste is treated,  recycled, or incinerated within the governing safety standards  for health and the environment."
10,Apple.pdf,Any facility that doesn’t meet  our requirements is replaced by another approved waste facility.
10,Apple.pdf,Above: By switching to  recycled and reusable  alternatives—including  the Recyclable Protective  Film pictured here—70  supplier sites have achieved  Zero Waste certifications.
10,Apple.pdf,Our suppliers play an essential role in realizing our goals for zero  waste.
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2015, we launched our supplier Zero Waste Program for  our manufacturing partners."
10,Apple.pdf,"More than 165 participating facilities  can access resources including guidance on waste diversion,  tools to improve waste management, and in some cases, onsite  support."
10,Apple.pdf,Each effort contributes to our goal.
10,Apple.pdf,"Suppliers diverted  over 400,000 metric tons of waste destined for landfills in 2020,  bringing the total to 1.65 million metric tons diverted since the  program’s inception in 2015."
10,Apple.pdf,"This is the equivalent of eliminating  more than 200,000 garbage trucks of waste sent to landfill."
10,Apple.pdf,"Building on the progress made over the past several years,  we continue to drive toward zero waste at our final assembly  sites."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve recently engaged facilities assembling our Beats  products, in addition to locations assembling iPhone, iPad,  Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and Apple TV."
10,Apple.pdf,"With  this latest achievement, as of December 2020, 100 percent of  established final assembly sites are now Zero Waste certified.40  We’ve continued to expand the program further to include  component manufacturing sites, with a particular focus on Apple  Watch."
10,Apple.pdf,"Select Apple Watch components, including batteries and  speakers, are already made at Zero Waste certified facilities."
10,Apple.pdf,"Across all product lines, a total of 70 suppliers achieved  certification by the end of 2020, representing a nearly   40 percent increase from 2019."
10,Apple.pdf,This includes our Goertek  AirPods assembly site in Vietnam—a first for Apple and for  the country.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve supported our suppliers in achieving these certifications,  finding innovative solutions to reduce and recycle waste."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve  broadened the use of Recyclable Protective Film (RPF)—which  protects products during manufacturing—to Mac and iPad  product lines in addition to iPhone.
10,Apple.pdf,"By ensuring that the film is  recycled, we have been able to divert more than 4700 metric  tons of waste from incineration."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve also expanded the use of  a more efficient shrink-wrap to pilot AirPods, iPad, and iPhone  assembly sites—reducing material used by 25 percent."
10,Apple.pdf,"By  sharing this innovation with other industry leaders, including a  major e-commerce company in China, we hope to help expand  its impact beyond our own supply chain to other industries."
10,Apple.pdf,"The buildings where we meet and create— retail stores, data centers, offices—are key  to preserving the creativity and collaboration  unique to Apple."
10,Apple.pdf,Our shared spaces inspire  innovation.
10,Apple.pdf,They also reflect our values.
10,Apple.pdf,It’s  our duty to examine the impact each of our  buildings has on the environment.
10,Apple.pdf,Prioritizing this work starts with aligning our design and  construction criteria to industry-recognized best practices for  green buildings.
10,Apple.pdf,"These promote activities like water conservation,  energy efficiency, and responsible material sourcing."
10,Apple.pdf,"To date,  80 of our sites are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment  Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment  Environmental Assessment Method) certified."
10,Apple.pdf,And we continue  to increase that total as we support the construction of more than  15 million square feet of green building space around the world.
10,Apple.pdf,Our retail stores illustrate our dedication to the environment— from the early phases of design through the everyday use of  a site.
10,Apple.pdf,This approach informed the construction of our Marina  Bay Sands retail space in Singapore.
10,Apple.pdf,The glazing system on  the glass façade capitalizes on daylight while limiting solar  exposure.
10,Apple.pdf,"This reduces the electricity needed for both lighting  and cooling, so the overall energy performance exceeds the  ASHRAE 90.1 benchmark.41 The site also uses FSC-certified  wood materials, and meets Singapore’s Green Mark standard for  environmental performance."
10,Apple.pdf,Our footprint extends to our corporate offices.
10,Apple.pdf,"Each project  is unique, and varies to adapt to new locations and climates."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, at our office in Hyderabad, India, outdoor  temperatures can often reach above 100° Fahrenheit."
10,Apple.pdf,"To ensure  the efficient use of resources and a comfortable environment  for our employees, we customized the systems installed to  adjust temperature and light."
10,Apple.pdf,Daylight sensors near windows  automatically dim or brighten based on the location of the sun.
10,Apple.pdf,Best-in-class water-cooled chillers and HVAC systems optimize  and reduce energy use.
10,Apple.pdf,"An onsite facility treats and reuses 80  percent of the location’s wastewater for cooling, flushing, and  irrigation, reducing overall water demand."
10,Apple.pdf,"All of these processes  are closely monitored by a Building Management System,  allowing our operations teams to continually optimize energy   and resource efficiency."
10,Apple.pdf,The Covid-19 pandemic greatly impacted the way we manage  our spaces.
10,Apple.pdf,"Over the past year, we’ve adjusted lighting and  HVAC systems across our facilities on an ongoing basis, to  adapt to reduced capacity and use patterns."
10,Apple.pdf,"As people return  to our facilities, we’re constantly monitoring occupancy levels to  determine what additional ventilation and air filtration is needed  to protect our employees."
10,Apple.pdf,"Safety remains our first priority, which  has to be considered alongside our environmental goals."
10,Apple.pdf,Human-centric design cannot exist without considering how  the built environment interacts with the world around us.
10,Apple.pdf,We  are constantly challenging ourselves to find new ways to build  creative spaces that prioritize the environment we all share.
10,Apple.pdf,"The well-being of our suppliers, employees, customers, and the planet is a priority for Apple, which is why  we’re committed to using safer materials to create safer products."
10,Apple.pdf,"This requires diligent work—to build  a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain, to promote the use of better chemical  management processes and safer chemical alternatives, and to innovate through design for smarter  approaches to making our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple continues to lead on smarter chemistry,  pushing for advancements in new materials  that not only can have an impact on human  health and the environment, but also influence  how our industry operates."
10,Apple.pdf,Our work begins with the substances in our products.
10,Apple.pdf,"By focusing  on safety in our product designs, we strive to protect the people  who design, make, use, and recycle our devices."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through close  engagement with leading members of the scientific community,  NGOs, and industry initiatives, we aim to drive a broader global  shift toward materials that are safer to use and reuse."
10,Apple.pdf,To do this right means doing more than abiding by regulations  governing harmful substances.
10,Apple.pdf,It means applying higher  standards and ensuring that those we work with comply  with these standards.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve done this with our Regulated  Substances Specification (RSS), which exceeds many regional  regulatory requirements."
10,Apple.pdf,As we drive innovation—promoting the  development and use of safer materials—we seek to share what  we learn with others in industry.
10,Apple.pdf,"By holding ourselves and our suppliers to these standards,  we create products that are safer across their entire life cycle."
10,Apple.pdf,"Materials with smarter chemistries can be more readily recycled  and reused, enabling our efforts to create circular supply chains  for our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"This impacts not only our design processes,  but also our manufacturing processes—transitioning suppliers  to safer alternatives protects workers and the world we live in."
10,Apple.pdf,"We also recognize that when safe materials are recycled within  circular supply chains, it benefits communities that may otherwise  be exposed to waste."
10,Apple.pdf,And our work never stops.
10,Apple.pdf,"As we and our  suppliers identify and design new materials and chemistries,  we are committed to taking a leadership role in evaluating and  pursuing safe and sustainable alternatives—and promoting this  progress beyond our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,Mapping and engagement:  Engage our supply chain partners to build  a comprehensive inventory of chemicals  used to make our products and go beyond  regulatory compliance.
10,Apple.pdf,Innovation:  Exceed regional requirements by innovating  safer alternatives and improving how we and  oursuppliers manage potential risks of chemicals.
10,Apple.pdf,Assessment:  Assess the potential human health and  environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate  compliance with our requirements and inform  product design.
10,Apple.pdf,Our commitment to smarter chemistry starts  with a deep understanding of the materials  and chemistries used to make our products.
10,Apple.pdf,We work closely with our supplier partners to ensure that  they understand and share our goals.
10,Apple.pdf,This includes improving  the safety of the chemicals we use in both our products and  manufacturing processes.
10,Apple.pdf,"And as our products advance and  suppliers evolve with us, we collect information on the chemical  composition of the new materials our suppliers use."
10,Apple.pdf,The goal of this work is to ensure the safety of our products  across their life cycle.
10,Apple.pdf,"We set out to understand the impact of  chemicals at each milestone: from the manufacturing process,  to the customer experience, to end-of-life—when materials in  a product are recovered or recycled."
10,Apple.pdf,This is an area where we are leading.
10,Apple.pdf,Few electronics  manufacturers have gone to such an extent to understand the  chemical composition of their products.
10,Apple.pdf,"Without this vital data,  they are limited in their ability to address potential toxicological  risks that may be associated with their manufacturing processes  and the products they make."
10,Apple.pdf,"Given the highly sensitive nature  of this information, it’s often hard for those who make these  materials to share with manufacturers further up in the supply  chain."
10,Apple.pdf,The information we gather—and the process we use— can guide others in our industry to improve the overall safety  of electronic product design and manufacturing.
10,Apple.pdf,Progress  across our industry matters to us.
10,Apple.pdf,Only by restricting the use of  potentially harmful chemicals in products can we all safely build  circular economies at scale.
10,Apple.pdf,The first step in this process is gathering the most detailed  information possible to inform the actions we take.
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2016, we  launched the Full Material Disclosure program to catalog and map  each of the chemicals in our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Material manufacturers  deep in our supply chain play a critical role, reporting detailed— and often proprietary—data on their material compositions and  manufacturing processes."
10,Apple.pdf,This greater clarity on the chemical  composition of the materials used in our products empowers  our suppliers and us to make informed choices on materials  selection—and drive change for future products across  our industry.
10,Apple.pdf,Each supplier is required to report the materials used to  manufacture Apple products.
10,Apple.pdf,"To streamline this requirement,  we’ve created an advanced collection system to capture this  data."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our suppliers reference our library of over 40,000 materials  to provide the most detailed and accurate description of each  material they report—and each material within this library  has been validated against information from the material  manufacturer."
10,Apple.pdf,"If a supplier is using a material not found in  our library, we engage with both the supplier and the material  manufacturer to confirm the material is genuine."
10,Apple.pdf,"In many cases,  we’ll already have information from the manufacturer on the  material’s makeup."
10,Apple.pdf,"In the cases where we do not, our experts  then evaluate the material composition provided by the suppliers  to make sure it aligns with expected properties for that class of  material—an extra step to use the most accurate data possible."
10,Apple.pdf,Through these efforts we’ve been able to understand the  detailed composition of our final products.
10,Apple.pdf,We prioritize those  that are key for biocompatibility—we have collected detailed  chemical information for all materials that come under prolonged  skin contact and require qualification from our biocompatibility  team.
10,Apple.pdf,"For iPhone, iPad, and Mac products released in 2020, we  collected detailed chemical information on more than 85 percent,  on average, of product mass."
10,Apple.pdf,"For the 13-inch MacBook Pro  (2020), we collected information on more than 90 percent of  the product by mass."
10,Apple.pdf,This includes tens of thousands of parts  and assemblies.
10,Apple.pdf,This process represents a distinct innovation for smarter  chemistry.
10,Apple.pdf,"While there is important work to be done in developing  newer chemistries with reduced potential toxicological risks, there  is also an opportunity that comes with developing a foundation  of knowledge."
10,Apple.pdf,"By creating and maintaining a comprehensive  database with accurate, precise, and current information on  materials, we’re able to inform the entire product life cycle—from  the materials we select, to how we choose to manufacture and,  eventually, recycle and reuse them."
10,Apple.pdf,"This benefits not just our  products, but through driving access to information, contributes  to the safety of the broader electronics industry."
10,Apple.pdf,"Information on how chemicals are used, how  they’re stored, and how employees are protected  is shared with Apple by suppliers through our  Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program."
10,Apple.pdf,"FMD and CSD programs represent our ongoing  efforts to evaluate materials against the strict  requirements of our RSS, inform use of safer  materials in manufacturing processes and  our products, and promote safety within our  supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,We prioritize the health and safety of the people who make  our products.
10,Apple.pdf,Protecting those working within our supply chain  means looking beyond our end products.
10,Apple.pdf,"When selecting  chemicals and supporting better chemical management, we  consider the full experience of the people building our products."
10,Apple.pdf,Our Code and Standards set clear workplace safety requirements  for our suppliers.
10,Apple.pdf,Our Chemical Safety Disclosure program advances disclosure  around the chemistries used in manufacturing processes for our  products.
10,Apple.pdf,"We work with participating suppliers to identify how  chemicals are used and stored, as well as what mechanisms  suppliers have in place to protect their employees."
10,Apple.pdf,This enhanced  access to information allows us to help our suppliers prioritize  chemistries to substitute or manage through enhanced controls  or safety procedures.
10,Apple.pdf,This effort captures information on process chemicals across our  supply chain.
10,Apple.pdf,More than 600 facilities have shared their chemical  inventories.
10,Apple.pdf,"This data includes how the chemical is used, stored  and the safety practices each site follows to protect employees."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through this process, we’ve identified 14,000 unique process  chemicals and applications."
10,Apple.pdf,"And by collecting information on  both the chemistries themselves and how they are used, we’re  able to remove chemistries that don’t meet our health and  safety standards."
10,Apple.pdf,We also identify opportunities to create safer  alternatives—contributing to a safer work environment for the  millions of people who work with our suppliers.
10,Apple.pdf,The global regulatory and compliance landscape continually  evolves.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our environmental approach, and the science we work  from, mean our requirements may exceed those of local material  safety regulations."
10,Apple.pdf,"When new regulatory benchmarks are put in  place, we work directly with our suppliers to take steps to support  the development of compliant programs at each of our suppliers’  facilities."
10,Apple.pdf,"This process involves direct local-language training  covering Regulated Substance Specification (RSS), our Full  Material Disclosure and Chemical Safety Disclosure programs,  and new compliance standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, in March, China released the national regulation  around Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) as part of its “Blue  Sky Initiative.” We previously had requirements in place governing  VOCs—which often appear in inks, coatings, adhesives, and  cleaners—to track how our suppliers use them and restrict  their use in select applications."
10,Apple.pdf,"With the launch of the new  regulation, we provided additional support with trainings for  more than 2000 supplier participants."
10,Apple.pdf,And we’ve deployed  a new VOC specification worldwide to help drive adoption of  low-VOC alternatives.
10,Apple.pdf,"Through this specification, we’re signaling  to our suppliers around the world the importance of these  improved alternatives."
10,Apple.pdf,Our supplier engagement efforts show clear results when new  regulations are passed.
10,Apple.pdf,The strong foundation of data provided  by our disclosure programs plays a key role.
10,Apple.pdf,It establishes a clear  understanding of the chemistries across our supply chain that  may be impacted by new regulations.
10,Apple.pdf,And these efforts support  the safety of our supply chain.
10,Apple.pdf,"With our products, we aim to make the best  chemical and material choices possible to  allow for the protection of human health and  the environment."
10,Apple.pdf,To evaluate compliance  with our standards—including the RSS— we require our material suppliers to adhere  to specifications that restrict the use of  certain chemicals.
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple subjects the materials in our products to rigorous  evaluation and testing, and our board-certified toxicologists  review these results and the chemical formulation of materials  for safety."
10,Apple.pdf,The data we collect forms the foundation for key decisions in  the design and manufacturing processes.
10,Apple.pdf,Our assessment  system helps ensure that only materials that meet our stringent  requirements can be used in Apple products.
10,Apple.pdf,"And by establishing  conservative restrictions on chemicals, testing for substances  of concern, and conducting toxicological evaluations, Apple  prioritizes the safety of our customers and those who make  and recycle our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Building on our history of advancements in material safety, Apple  published the Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) in  2002, setting standards for the chemicals in our products and  manufacturing processes."
10,Apple.pdf,"To create the RSS, we worked from the  guidance of experts, including toxicologists and dermatologists,  and harmonized with international laws and directives regulating  harmful chemicals—as well as our own policies."
10,Apple.pdf,The RSS continuously evolves to incorporate the latest scientific  research and is regularly updated with new chemicals and scopes  of restrictions.
10,Apple.pdf,"These changes expand chemical restrictions that,  in many instances, already exceed local regulatory requirements."
10,Apple.pdf,"Most recently, we added a group of acrylate monomers, two   sub-classes of PFAS chemicals, and broadened our restrictions  on VOCs with a dedicated specification."
10,Apple.pdf,"This year, we also  restricted additional process chemicals and expanded the scope  of select existing restrictions."
10,Apple.pdf,"Each RSS update is reviewed  by our Green Chemistry Advisory Board, made up of leading  toxicologists, researchers, and academics."
10,Apple.pdf,This independent  review helps to ensure that we’re leading the way to protect  our customers and those who make or recycled our products.
10,Apple.pdf,We pay special attention to the materials that will be in prolonged  skin contact and apply rigorous controls defined in our Restricted  Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list.
10,Apple.pdf,"In particular,  the restrictions focus on avoiding skin reactions most commonly  reported across wearable products, like jewelry."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve updated  our list of restricted chemicals to align with leading standards,  recommendations from toxicologists and dermatologists,  international laws and directives, and Apple policies."
10,Apple.pdf,"We vet  supplier compliance, confirming that each material that comes  into prolonged contact with skin is evaluated according to the  latest standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"All of our specifications are incorporated into contractual  obligations for our suppliers, and each helps us maintain our  high standards."
10,Apple.pdf,Our restrictions on  potentially harmful  chemicals are available  online in the Apple  Regulated Substances  Specification (PDF)   and in Apple’s  Restricted Chemicals  for Prolonged Skin  Contact Materials  (PDF) list.
10,Apple.pdf,"We test materials, parts, and final products to ensure  biocompatibility and compliance with our RSS, so that  our products are safe to make, use, and recycle."
10,Apple.pdf,"We help our suppliers to use safer cleaners and degreasers  in manufacturing, protecting the workers in our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,We collect data from our suppliers to inform how we design  our products and processes to ensure safety and compliance  with our requirements.
10,Apple.pdf,Apple’s Environmental Testing Lab performs chemical analyses  to evaluate the safety of our products and materials.
10,Apple.pdf,Our chemists  test materials for safety and monitor compliance with the  specifications.
10,Apple.pdf,"To meet this challenge, the Lab continues to grow,  both in its mission and capacity."
10,Apple.pdf,"As we develop our Full Material  Disclosure and Chemical Safety Disclosure programs, we’re also  expanding our testing facilities with new technologies to conduct  chemical analysis."
10,Apple.pdf,"In addition to the work done at our lab, our  teams review test reports from suppliers to evaluate substances  against the RSS."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, we performed toxicological  assessments on 1400 new materials to proactively evaluate  and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Each year, we conduct more than 100 chemical assessments on  chemistries before they are used in our manufacturing processes."
10,Apple.pdf,The data we collect from our disclosure programs drives  our assessments.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re able to generate comprehensive  assessments, like GreenScreen®, a methodology we use to  gauge the impact of chemicals on individual health and the  environment based on 18 criteria."
10,Apple.pdf,"We also develop toxicological  profiles for new chemicals, using both scientific literature and  internal assessments to determine safe thresholds for use."
10,Apple.pdf,"These  profiles detail the features of each chemical, providing data that  allows us to evaluate the safety of the use of a substance in a  particular product."
10,Apple.pdf,"And, in 2020, we expanded the scope of  biocompatibility testing beyond individual materials to include  modules and whole products."
10,Apple.pdf,"Through toxicological evaluations  of materials within the product, we can assess potential indirect  exposure to substances during use."
10,Apple.pdf,"In A Protocol for  Prioritizing Chemicals  of Concern in the  Electronics Industry  (PDF), we share a  framework to help  actors across industries  systematically evaluate  chemistries."
10,Apple.pdf,What we learn about the safety of our  materials enables us to make world-changing  products while moving our industry forward  to support the protection of health and  the environment.
10,Apple.pdf,Our efforts to map and assess the chemicals within our supply  chain ultimately fuel innovations.
10,Apple.pdf,"We use toxicology data at each  point in the product life cycle, from design, to manufacturing,  to end-of-life."
10,Apple.pdf,This allows us to seek out and develop safer  chemistries that have an impact on each phase—and contribute  to continually improving the overall safety of our products  and processes.
10,Apple.pdf,"The earlier we focus on chemical safety in the product life cycle,  the more options we have along the way to innovate solutions to  improve the substances used."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re able to approach smarter  chemistry holistically, designing to our customers’ needs, so that  our products are safer for use, reuse, and recycling."
10,Apple.pdf,Choosing the materials we include in our products is one  important element of this.
10,Apple.pdf,We utilize our comprehensive  chemical profiles of each material to inform design choices.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our  toxicological assessments look at each chemical within a material,  with a particular focus on those that come into prolonged  contact with skin."
10,Apple.pdf,"As we select the materials to include in our  products, we assess the process chemicals required with each  design choice."
10,Apple.pdf,"We account for the storage and application of  each of these materials, evaluating the exposure to potentially  harmful substances."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, we conducted reviews of more  than 100 process chemicals prior to launch, so we could, where  appropriate, adopt a safer alternative before production started."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, we worked with a supplier to create a new low-VOC  alternative cleaner that met our requirements."
10,Apple.pdf,"And, finally, we consider what happens when our products  reach their end-of-life."
10,Apple.pdf,Potentially harmful substances can  have an impact on the recyclability of a material.
10,Apple.pdf,"In some cases,  chemistries that are harmless in small quantities become more  concentrated through recycling cycles."
10,Apple.pdf,"This can lead to down- cycling—use of the material in lower-quality applications—or  
could make the material unsafe for any use."
10,Apple.pdf,This is true of the  brominated flame retardants (BFRs) that have historically been  used in plastics.
10,Apple.pdf,The negative environmental effects of these  chemicals outweigh the benefits they offer—and come at the  expense of the recyclability of the material they’re used in.
10,Apple.pdf,Finding  safer alternative flame retardants to replace BFRs means our  products are both safer to use and more desirable for recycling.
10,Apple.pdf,"By selecting materials with safer chemistries at the outset, we  can improve their recoverability."
10,Apple.pdf,"This not only protects those who  use our products, but also enables the reuse of key materials  like plastic and aluminum."
10,Apple.pdf,Our efforts to eliminate BFRs from the  plastics we use in our products have improved the recyclability  of our plastic components.
10,Apple.pdf,And our detailed knowledge of the  makeup of our high-quality aluminum adds to the benefits of  collecting and reusing our aluminum scrap.
10,Apple.pdf,"By keeping potentially  harmful chemicals out of our supply chain at the outset, we can  be confident that the material we recover maintains our quality  and performance standards."
10,Apple.pdf,Above: Our detailed  knowledge of the makeup of  our high-quality aluminum  adds to the benefits of  collecting and reusing our  aluminum scrap.
10,Apple.pdf,PVC and phthalates  Replaced with safer thermoplastic elastomers.42  Both are still used by other companies in power  cords and headphone cables.
10,Apple.pdf,"Brominated flame retardants (BFRs)  Eliminated from thousands of parts such as  enclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors  in 2008."
10,Apple.pdf,"We use safer metal hydroxides and  phosphorus compounds in their place.42 
Mercury  Eliminated from displays in 2009."
10,Apple.pdf,"We use   energy-efficient, mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs  instead of mercury-based fluorescent lamps in  all our displays."
10,Apple.pdf,Beryllium   Eliminated from all new product designs.
10,Apple.pdf,Beryllium  is found in copper alloys used to make connectors  and springs.
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve made safer materials a priority for our business—and   used our procurement process to encourage our suppliers  to follow suit.
10,Apple.pdf,Our strict environmental standards governing  potentially harmful substances in our products and processes  have created a market for safer alternatives.
10,Apple.pdf,"And we’re working  with our suppliers to meet this demand, lending the expertise  we’ve developed to create safer chemistries where none exist."
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve done the critical work of phasing out chemistries that  don’t meet our standards; this next step of innovating smarter  chemistries will change how the industry operates—and help  fulfill our aim of working toward a world we want to live within,   one free of harmful substances."
10,Apple.pdf,This has required collaboration.
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve used our extensive  research and analysis of materials to enable our suppliers to find  safer alternatives.
10,Apple.pdf,"In cases where these alternatives have yet to  be created, we lend our technical capabilities in material science  as we work with our suppliers to develop entirely new chemistries."
10,Apple.pdf,"We subject these new alternatives to the same rigorous testing,  evaluating the material against our high performance and  safety standards."
10,Apple.pdf,These innovations to continually improve chemistries build on   our history of successfully phasing out potentially harmful  chemicals.
10,Apple.pdf,"Since the late 1990s, we have diligently identified  and removed potentially harmful chemicals from our products,  including phthalates, lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others.42  This has required developing alternatives—by creating safer  compounds to replace potentially harmful chemistries or  replacing components with alternatives that meet our safety  standards."
10,Apple.pdf,"In some cases, we’ve redesigned our products to  eliminate the need for parts that incorporate these materials."
10,Apple.pdf,Our work has received recognition.
10,Apple.pdf,"For the third year in a row,  Apple received an A+ rating from Mind the Store, an external  campaign that evaluates the largest retailers in North America  on how they ensure the chemical safety of their products  and packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,We are the first consumer  electronics company to  receive the EPA Safer  Choice Partner of the  Year Award for our work  to scale use of safer  cleaners.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our work on smarter chemistry is resource-intensive, from  gathering the information, to assessing the data, to developing  safer alternatives."
10,Apple.pdf,Our suppliers often don’t have the same  capacity to subject their materials and processes to the level  of due diligence required to assess their safety.
10,Apple.pdf,"For this reason,  we support our suppliers by sharing the safer alternatives we’ve  identified."
10,Apple.pdf,And by promoting the use of substances that meet  our standards.
10,Apple.pdf,An area where we are making an immediate impact is the  application of cleaners and degreasers.
10,Apple.pdf,These substances  account for some of the highest use materials within our supply  chain—and their chemistries have been the focus of considerable  attention from regulators and environmental health and  safety organizations.
10,Apple.pdf,"Rather than reviewing our suppliers’ inventories for potentially  harmful chemistries, we’ve reversed the process—creating  a list of cleaners and degreasers that have been determined  to be safer for use with appropriate controls."
10,Apple.pdf,"We invested in  the in-depth assessment and evaluation of these substances,  incorporating leading guidance by GreenScreen® and the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program."
10,Apple.pdf,"In  2020, we evaluated 54 new cleaners of which 33 passed our  assessment, bringing our total approved alternatives to cleaners  and degreasers to 80."
10,Apple.pdf,All of our final assembly sites now use  these safer cleaners.
10,Apple.pdf,We want to make the transition to safer  alternatives accessible to others as well.
10,Apple.pdf,"That’s why we have  partnered with Clean Production Action, an advocacy nonprofit,  to create clear criteria to assess the safety of cleaners in use  across our industry."
10,Apple.pdf,These efforts have a direct impact—and the potential to change  how our industry operates.
10,Apple.pdf,"More than 80,000 workers within our  supply chain now use safer alternative cleaners and degreasers."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2020, we were the first consumer electronics company  to receive the EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award  in recognition for our work to scale the use of safer process  chemicals, and protect those working in our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re also partnering with NGOs to make information about these  materials readily available throughout the electronics industry.
10,Apple.pdf,"One effort is ChemFORWARD, a nonprofit collaboration of  brands, retailers, suppliers, and environmental organizations that  share high-quality, actionable chemical hazard data via a globally  harmonized repository."
10,Apple.pdf,"With ChemFORWARD, we’ll share our list  of safe cleaners and degreasers and our evaluation framework  with companies beyond our suppliers and even our industry."
10,Apple.pdf,We also worked with the Clean Electronics Production Network  (CEPN)—a multi-stakeholder initiative working to address  health and safety challenges in the electronics supply chain— to develop the Process Chemicals Data Collection (PCDC)  Tool.
10,Apple.pdf,"The PCDC Tool is a free, standardized reporting tool that  improves the process of collecting and managing data related  to process chemicals usage in the electronics industry."
10,Apple.pdf,"Among  other benefits, the tool creates an industry-wide format for  consistent collection of information across the supply chain, and  enables identification and quantification of chemical use, to help  drive safer substitutions across the industry."
10,Apple.pdf,All of the changes  we make today contribute to our goal of protecting the planet  we share.
10,Apple.pdf," “Apple demonstrates leadership  not only by using safer alternative  chemistries in its own supply chain,  but also by collaborating to encourage  and facilitate others to do the same."
10,Apple.pdf,"This is a key example of the systems  transformation we see taking place  to enable safer chemical use globally,  across industries.” 
This year, when we updated our Regulated Substances  Specification (RSS), we engaged the group of experts from  our Green Chemistry Advisory Board to review our guidelines  and provide direct feedback."
10,Apple.pdf,"Their input on the RSS was part  of our ongoing engagement with the Board, a community of  toxicologists and researchers Apple convened who share our  vision of developing safer chemistries."
10,Apple.pdf,We value the insight and  experience of others engaging in the urgent work of keeping  potentially harmful chemicals out of product materials and  manufacturing processes.
10,Apple.pdf,This cooperation fuels our innovations  around smarter chemistry and developing alternatives to  potentially harmful substances.
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve also joined with multiple industry initiatives to contribute  to the broader global movement toward safer chemistries.
10,Apple.pdf,This  includes our engagement with Clean Production Action and now  ChemFORWARD; we engage with both on their efforts around  identifying harmful substances and developing safer alternatives  for the electronics industry.
10,Apple.pdf,"We also helped found and sit on the  board of the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), a  collection of stakeholders working to address complex health and  safety challenges specific to the electronics supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"The  Center for Sustainability Solutions at Green America, a leading  environmental advocacy organization, facilitates this network of  civil society organizations, academic researchers, worker rights  advocates, and companies."
10,Apple.pdf,We’re moving toward an industry-wide response to reducing  potentially harmful substances in our products and processes  to support our goals of ensuring a healthy workplace for those  that make our products and promoting a circular economy.
10,Apple.pdf,"By  eliminating chemicals that would negatively impact the ability for  our products to be recycled and reused, we can achieve this goal."
10,Apple.pdf,"Left: We plan to share the  list of safe cleaners and  degreasers used in our own  supply chain with companies  beyond our industry,  through our partnership  with ChemFORWARD."

10,Apple.pdf,1  Apple is carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2020.
10,Apple.pdf,Scope 1 emissions have been re-stated for fiscal years 2017-2018 based on improved data sources.
10,Apple.pdf,"2  Starting in fiscal year 2016, scope 1 emissions capture diesel use in emergency back-up generators and propane gas use in corporate offices."
10,Apple.pdf,4  The building operations and cooling emissions (PUE) associated with our colocated data facilities are beyond our operational control and therefore these emissions are not included in our report.
10,Apple.pdf,"5  In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed above."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, these include electricity transmission and distribution losses (72,000 metric tons CO2e) and life cycle emissions  associated with renewable energy (26,000 metric tons CO2e)."
10,Apple.pdf,6  We are constantly revisiting our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards.
10,Apple.pdf,"So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for  classes of service in air travel."
10,Apple.pdf,"As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions increased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018."
10,Apple.pdf,"Without the methodology change, these emissions would have  increased by 14 percent, which reflects the growth in our business."
10,Apple.pdf,"7  We adjusted our methodology for fiscal year 2017 to take into account Apple’s “At Home Advisors” program, where employees work remotely."
10,Apple.pdf,"8  Because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we’re constantly refining our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data."
10,Apple.pdf,"For example, we recently obtained more accurate data for the amount  of electricity used to manufacture a number of components like onboard electronics, bare boards and flexes, and various module assemblies."
10,Apple.pdf,The net result was an increase in our 2019 carbon footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"When using  the same data and model as 2018, our carbon emissions in 2019 would have been about 23 million metric tons, or a decrease of 7 percent."
10,Apple.pdf,"9  Due to rounding, our total comprehensive carbon footprint is not always the sum of the subtotals disclosed above."
10,Apple.pdf,"Notes: For data on previous years, please reference past Environmental Progress Reports, available at apple.com/environment."
10,Apple.pdf,Dash indicates data that are not available.
10,Apple.pdf,"Due to rounding, totals may not be the sum of the subtotals."
10,Apple.pdf,"1   To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part  measurements of the entire product along with data on part  production."
10,Apple.pdf,"The measurements help us accurately determine  the size and weight of the components and materials in  the product, while data on manufacturing processes and  yield loss during production allows us to account for the  impact of manufacturing."
10,Apple.pdf,"The LCA includes accessories and  packaging, as well as decreased emissions through Apple’s  Supplier Clean Energy Program."
10,Apple.pdf,"When calculating Apple’s  comprehensive carbon footprint, we also include units that  are repaired and replaced through AppleCare."
10,Apple.pdf,"2   To model customer use, we measure the power consumed  by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario."
10,Apple.pdf,Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a  mixture of actual and modeled customer use data.
10,Apple.pdf,"For the  purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based  on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and  tvOS devices and three years for iOS, iPadOS and watchOS  devices."
10,Apple.pdf,"Most Apple products last longer and are often  passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner  for others to use."
10,Apple.pdf,More information on our product energy use  is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.
10,Apple.pdf,"3   To model transportation, we use data collected on  shipments of single products and multipack units by  land, sea, and air."
10,Apple.pdf,We account for transporting materials  between manufacturing sites; transporting products from  manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting  products from regional distribution hubs to individual  customers; and transporting products from final customers  to recycling facilities.
10,Apple.pdf,"4   To model end of life, we use material composition data on  our products and estimate the ratio of products that are  sent to recycling or disposal."
10,Apple.pdf,"For products sent to recycling,  we capture the initial processing by the recycler to prepare  the product for recovery of electronic, metal, plastic, and  glass material streams."
10,Apple.pdf,"Subsequent downstream recycling  processes are not included, as these are considered stages  of production and not end-of-life processing."
10,Apple.pdf,"For products  sent to disposal, we capture the emissions associated with  landfilling or incineration of each type of material."
10,Apple.pdf,"5   After we collect data about manufacturing, use,  transportation, and end of life, we combine it with detailed  greenhouse gas emission data."
10,Apple.pdf,"This emission data is based  on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average  datasets for material production, manufacturing processes,  electricity generation, and transportation."
10,Apple.pdf,"Renewable energy  used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently  or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, is also  accounted for within the LCA model."
10,Apple.pdf,Combining product- specific information with emission data in our LCA allows us  to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions  as they relate to each product.
10,Apple.pdf,The data and modeling  approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the  Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.
10,Apple.pdf,There is inherent uncertainty in modeling carbon emissions due  primarily to data limitations.
10,Apple.pdf,"For the top component contributors  to Apple’s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty  by developing detailed process-based environmental models  with Apple-specific parameters."
10,Apple.pdf,"For the remaining elements  of Apple’s carbon footprint, we rely on industry average data  and assumptions."
10,Apple.pdf,"2  Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012."
10,Apple.pdf,All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented  by the California Energy Commission.
10,Apple.pdf,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, corporate facilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy."
10,Apple.pdf,These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives.
10,Apple.pdf,We also recognize that energy use at our employees’ homes likely increased during this period.
10,Apple.pdf,"3  Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated on a calendar year basis."
10,Apple.pdf,"Beginning in 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated based on the fiscal year."
10,Apple.pdf,4  We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis.
10,Apple.pdf,"Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from  renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"1  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, our boundary expanded to include more than 150 million gallons of water used annually at distribution centers and co-located data centers."
10,Apple.pdf,Water use has been re-stated for fiscal year  2019 based on improved data sources.
10,Apple.pdf,"2  We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of which comes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources."
10,Apple.pdf,3  Recycled water represents a key alternative water source.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment."
10,Apple.pdf,"Recycled water is primarily used for  irrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing."
10,Apple.pdf,4  Other alternative sources of water include rainwater and recovered condensate that is captured onsite.
10,Apple.pdf,"Water used for construction for activities like dust control is not included in this total, and represents 8 million  gallons of water used in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"5  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, we’re including waste from Apple’s distribution centers."
10,Apple.pdf,Total does not include construction and demolition waste nor electronic waste.
10,Apple.pdf,We’re refining our methodology for collecting this  data and plan to include it in future years.
10,Apple.pdf,We have also re-stated the total for 2018 without these categories of waste.
10,Apple.pdf,"8  Since 2017, all of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources."
10,Apple.pdf,Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple’s Sustainable Fiber Specification.
10,Apple.pdf,We consider wood fibers to  include bamboo.
10,Apple.pdf,* Suppliers that have committed to 100 percent renewable energy since publication of the last Program Update in July 2020.
10,Apple.pdf,"To date, 109 suppliers across 24 countries have committed to manufacturing Apple products with 100 percent renewable  energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"For more information, please read our Supplier Clean Energy Program Update."
10,Apple.pdf,Use of renewable energy at our facilities has  been a central component of our emissions  reduction strategy since 2011.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’ve learned  a lot about how best to secure renewable  energy, which has helped us educate suppliers  and expand our renewable energy efforts into  our supply chain."
10,Apple.pdf,"This appendix summarizes  the types of renewable energy solutions we’ve  deployed, and details how we implement  renewable energy at our data centers—our  largest energy loads."
10,Apple.pdf,"Since launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we  have implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable  energy."
10,Apple.pdf,Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most  positive impact.
10,Apple.pdf,"Ownership and PURPA: In 2011, Apple’s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden  solar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company  built its own utility-scale solar PV project."
10,Apple.pdf,We used a 1978 federal  law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to  structure the project.
10,Apple.pdf,We then applied this same structure to two  more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina  and two micro-hydro projects in Oregon.
10,Apple.pdf,This was a landmark  moment in corporate renewable energy development and led to  an increased use of PURPA in these states.
10,Apple.pdf,"Direct Access: Since 2012, in California and Oregon, we’ve used a program  called Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation  offered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those  states."
10,Apple.pdf,"Instead, we contracted directly with independent power  producers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity."
10,Apple.pdf,"After initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects,  we’re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created:  The Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects deliver renewables  to our Oregon data center, and the California Flats solar project  to our data center, offices, and retail stores in California."
10,Apple.pdf,"Green Rider: In 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada."
10,Apple.pdf,"With no  PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly  with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory  structure."
10,Apple.pdf,"The “Nevada Green Rider” enables us to secure a  long-term, fixed-price contract for renewable electricity from  a new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling  320 megawatts.
10,Apple.pdf,"Equity investment: In 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in  Sichuan, China, to support all of our in-country retail stores,  corporate offices, and data storage facilities."
10,Apple.pdf,This project  represented the first time a commercial company created a  new large-scale project in China for its own use.
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve since  replicated this model many times for Apple’s supply chain.
10,Apple.pdf,"Portfolio solutions: In 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in  Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops  in Singapore and 300 in Japan."
10,Apple.pdf,We adapted our approach in  each country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures:  We signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase  agreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan.
10,Apple.pdf,These projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.
10,Apple.pdf,"Renewable microgrid: Since 2017, we’ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent  renewable energy—about 75 percent of which is generated  onsite and managed by a microgrid."
10,Apple.pdf,The onsite generation  comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts  of baseload biogas fuel cells.
10,Apple.pdf,Any additional energy required is  drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project  in nearby Monterey County.
10,Apple.pdf,"The microgrid system with battery  storage manages the renewable energy generation and the  building’s energy use; optimizes demand management, load  shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures  uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages."
10,Apple.pdf,"To reach 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple’s own  facilities, Apple has helped to create 1524 MW of renewable  energy around the world, with another 32 MW in development  (contracted)—for a total of 1557 megawatts."
10,Apple.pdf,The projects  listed to the right represent Apple-created renewable energy  projects supporting Apple facilities’ electricity use and  contributing to cleaner grids around the world.
10,Apple.pdf,"Operational  projects apply a mix of clean energy technology including wind  (21.6 percent), solar (77.2 percent), micro-hydro (0.22 percent),  and biogas fuel cells (0.92 percent)."
10,Apple.pdf,Dash indicates data are not tracked.
10,Apple.pdf,N/A = Gas use at colocation facilities are considered outside of Apple’s operational control.
10,Apple.pdf,1   We’ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple’s operational boundaries.
10,Apple.pdf,"Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we’ve removed electricity use associated  with colocation facility cooling and building operations."
10,Apple.pdf,"This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"The chart below provides a detailed breakdown of fiscal year 2020 energy use,   which we used to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions."
10,Apple.pdf,We used over 1.7 billion kWh of electricity in fiscal year 2020 to  power our data centers and colocation facilities around the world.
10,Apple.pdf,"We’re proud that 100 percent of that electricity came from clean,  renewable sources including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and  low-impact hydro power."
10,Apple.pdf,"To cover our needs, we build our own  renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean  energy from locally obtained resources."
10,Apple.pdf,"Between 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 megawatts of  Apple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, an  18-megawatt solar project, and 10 megawatts of biogas fuel cells."
10,Apple.pdf,"We then partnered with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help  build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program."
10,Apple.pdf,These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were  Duke Energy’s first Green Source Rider projects to become  operational.
10,Apple.pdf,"We worked with Duke Energy for several years to  develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple  and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable  energy projects."
10,Apple.pdf,The five Green Source Rider projects have a  combined capacity of 22 megawatts.
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2017, we made long-term  commitments to five more solar projects  
We now operate six data centers, and more are being developed."
10,Apple.pdf,"These data centers are spread across North America, Europe,  and Asia."
10,Apple.pdf,"Each has unique design features that conserve energy  and reflect the climate, as well as other aspects, of its location."
10,Apple.pdf,"in North Carolina, for an additional 85 megawatts of clean energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, the Maiden data center was supported by  projects that generated 358 million kWh of renewable energy,  which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 27,000 homes in  North Carolina for a year."
10,Apple.pdf,"Use of renewable energy allowed us to  avoid over 97,000 metric tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.2 
Energy efficiency measures we’ve implemented at our Maiden  data centers include use of outside air cooling through a  waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours,  which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle  75 percent of the time."
10,Apple.pdf,2  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"Carbon emissions  equivalences are calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf."
10,Apple.pdf,"To support our Prineville data center, we signed a 200-megawatt  power purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the  Montague Wind Power Facility, which entered commercial  operation at the end of 2019."
10,Apple.pdf,"It’s our largest project to date,  producing over 562 million kWh of clean, renewable energy  a year."
10,Apple.pdf,This is in addition to our power purchase agreement for the  56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just a few  miles from our data center.
10,Apple.pdf,"This solar PV project, which came  online and began supporting the data center in 2017, produces  141 million kWh of renewable energy per year."
10,Apple.pdf,"To strengthen the  connection between Apple and these projects, we use Oregon’s  Direct Access program to supply the renewable energy from  these projects directly to our data center."
10,Apple.pdf,Also supporting the data center are two micro-hydro projects that  harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals  that have been operating for over 60 years.
10,Apple.pdf,These micro-hydro  projects generate up to 7 to 10 million kWh of renewable energy  a year.
10,Apple.pdf,"To supplement these projects, we executed a long-term  purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a  69-megawatt portfolio of eight solar projects in Oregon."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, the Prineville data center was supported by  projects that generated 279 million kWh of renewable energy,  which is equivalent to the energy used by over 25,000 homes in  Oregon for a year."
10,Apple.pdf,"Use of renewable energy allowed us to avoid  over 197,000 metric tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.3  
Our Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry  climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible."
10,Apple.pdf,Indirect evaporative cooling is enabled when the outside air  temperature gets too high to cool the servers with outside  air alone.
10,Apple.pdf,3  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.

10,Apple.pdf,pdf.
10,Apple.pdf,"Unlike competitive energy markets where we’ve located some  of our data centers, the regulated electricity supply in Nevada  did not offer a simple solution for us to create new renewable  energy projects dedicated to our data center."
10,Apple.pdf,"So, in 2013, we  created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop  the Fort Churchill Solar project."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple designed, financed, and  constructed the project, and NV Energy operates it and directs  all the renewable energy it produces to our data center."
10,Apple.pdf,The Fort  Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel with curved  mirrors that concentrate sunlight.
10,Apple.pdf,The 20-megawatt array has an  annual production capacity of over 43 million kWh.
10,Apple.pdf,"To facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple  worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to  create a green energy option open to all commercial customers,  called the Nevada Green Rider, that does not require the  customer to fund project development up-front."
10,Apple.pdf,"Thanks to this  new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar  project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project."
10,Apple.pdf,"This project  came online in 2017, producing about 137 million kWh of  renewable energy per year."
10,Apple.pdf,"We have used the Nevada Green  Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren Solar  II project."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple’s largest solar project to date, it is estimated  to produce over 540 million kWh per year and came online in  late 2019."
10,Apple.pdf,"Next was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, which  came online in late 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,The project is estimated to produce  110 million kWh of renewable energy per year.
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020,  the Reno data center was supported by projects that generated  345 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the  energy used by nearly 32,000 homes in Nevada for a year."
10,Apple.pdf,"Use of  renewable energy allowed us to avoid more than 125,000 metric  tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.4 
Like in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the  mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever  possible."
10,Apple.pdf,"When the outside air is too warm to cool the servers  alone, it draws from indirect evaporative cooling."
10,Apple.pdf,4  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"Carbon emissions  equivalences are calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2019 data: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf."
10,Apple.pdf,"In 2017, Apple’s 130-megawatt California Flats solar project in  nearby Monterey County came online, and now we use Direct  Access to supply power from that project directly to our data  center as well as other Apple facilities in California."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, the Newark data center was supported by  projects that generated 99 million kWh of renewable energy,  which is equivalent to the energy used by nearly 15,000 homes   in California for a year."
10,Apple.pdf,"Use of renewable energy allowed us to  avoid more than 7,000 metric tons of CO₂e during the fiscal year.5 
Our data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent  renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,"We hit this milestone in January 2013, when  we began serving the data center with energy sourced primarily  from California wind power."
10,Apple.pdf,5  Emissions avoided are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.

10,Apple.pdf,"Our global command data center in Mesa, Arizona, came online in  2016."
10,Apple.pdf,"To support this facility, we partnered with the local utility, the  Salt River Project (SRP), to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke  solar project, which became operational in December 2016."
10,Apple.pdf,"This project produces over 148 million kWh of clean, renewable  energy a year, which roughly matches the energy used by the  data center."
10,Apple.pdf,"As the Mesa data center grew, it became apparent that we  needed additional sources of renewable energy to maintain our  100 percent renewable electricity goal."
10,Apple.pdf,We began to explore onsite solar options at the data center and  determined that we could provide valuable shaded parking that  paid for itself through energy bill reductions while adding to our  renewable energy portfolio.
10,Apple.pdf,"The resulting PV facility includes five  elevated parking canopies and three ground mounted arrays, for  a total generating capacity of 4.67 MW."
10,Apple.pdf,"The onsite PV system  began commercial operation in February 2019 and is expected to  generate 9,000 MWh per year."
10,Apple.pdf,"In addition, we began working with SRP to develop a customer  renewable energy program in 2017, resulting in their Sustainable  Energy Initiative, launched in 2019, to provide a diverse mix of  commercial electric customers with new renewable energy at  an affordable price."
10,Apple.pdf,"Under this program, Apple has executed an  agreement with SRP to purchase a portion of the output of their  proposed 100 MW Central Line PV Facility, expected to begin  operations in 2022."
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, the Mesa data center was supported by  227 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the  energy used by over 18,000 Arizona homes."
10,Apple.pdf,"Use of renewable  energy allowed us to avoid more than 107,000 metric tons of  CO₂e during the fiscal year.7 
6  Apple took operational control of the building in October 2015 and converted it to a data center that began servicing customers in March 2017:   www.srpnet.com/about/stations/pdfx/2018irp.pdf."

10,Apple.pdf,Our data center came online in 2020.
10,Apple.pdf,The data center’s  construction phase was powered with 100 percent wind energy  from a local renewable energy retailer in Denmark.
10,Apple.pdf,"Our Northern  Jutland PV project achieved commercial operation in late 2019,  will meet all of the data center’s near-term energy needs, and at  42 megawatts, is one of Denmark’s largest solar power plants."
10,Apple.pdf,"Our second renewable project in Denmark, a 17 MW wind project,  also came online in late 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"We have secured long-term supply  contracts with both Danish renewable projects, which will scale  up as our data center loads grow."
10,Apple.pdf,The power system design at the data center is based on a  resilient substation that eliminates the need for backup diesel  generators.
10,Apple.pdf,This reduces the carbon footprint of the data center  and completely eliminates the need for large diesel fuel storage  systems and diesel engine emissions that would impact the  local community.
10,Apple.pdf,"In fiscal year 2020, the Denmark data center sourced   13 million kWh of renewable energy, avoiding more than  5,000 metric tons of CO₂e."
10,Apple.pdf,"We have two new data centers in development in China, one in  Guizhou Province, the other in Inner Mongolia."
10,Apple.pdf,"Both data centers  are scheduled to come online in 2021, and we have lined up  renewable projects in China to supply the data centers with 100  percent renewable energy."
10,Apple.pdf,Data centers often rely on diesel-powered emergency generators  to provide a backup source of power in case of electrical outages.
10,Apple.pdf,Emergency generators must be exercised periodically to ensure  their operational reliability.
10,Apple.pdf,These preventative maintenance  activities as well as emergency operations during power outages  consume diesel fuel and result in air pollutant emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"As a  source of air pollutant emissions, the emergency generators at  Apple’s data centers are operated under air permits issued by  regulatory agencies."
10,Apple.pdf,"These permits require monitoring, testing,  inspection, and reporting at regular intervals."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve voluntarily installed emissions control systems on  our emergency generators to reduce emissions of nitrogen  oxides and particulates.
10,Apple.pdf,And we’re standardizing our approach  to preventative maintenance activities to minimize annual  testing hours.
10,Apple.pdf,"To further reduce air emissions at our data centers, we’re  finding innovative ways to minimize the use of diesel-powered  emergency generators."
10,Apple.pdf,"In Denmark, we’ve deployed a new  substation design, in conjunction with the local utility, with the  highest level of resiliency and automation."
10,Apple.pdf,It will allow Apple  to eliminate emergency generators altogether—in addition to  eliminating air emissions associated with diesel fuel delivery.
10,Apple.pdf,"At  our data centers in Nevada, North Carolina, and Oregon, we have  added a second transmission line, which increases the reliability  of the power supply and, therefore, minimizes the need for  emergency operation of the generators."
10,Apple.pdf,"The majority of our online services are provided by our own data  centers; however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for  additional data center capacity."
10,Apple.pdf,"While we don’t own these shared  facilities and use only a portion of their total capacity, we include  our portion of their energy use in our renewable energy goals."
10,Apple.pdf,"Starting January 2018, 100 percent of our power for colocation  facilities was matched with renewable energy generated within  the same state or NERC region for facilities in the United States,  or within the same country or regional grid for those around the  world."
10,Apple.pdf,"As our loads grow over time, we’ll continue working with  our colocation suppliers to match 100 percent of our energy  use with renewables."
10,Apple.pdf,"Furthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of  colocation services to help it develop the capability to provide  renewable energy solutions to its customers."
10,Apple.pdf,This partnership  advances Apple’s renewable energy program and those of other  companies that use this colocation provider.
10,Apple.pdf,"Beyond the use of our own data centers and colocation facilities,  we also use third-party services to support some of our on- demand cloud computing and storage services."
10,Apple.pdf,"We are requiring  these suppliers to adopt a 100 percent renewable energy strategy  for their Apple energy use, and we continue to work with our  suppliers to refine estimates for the carbon emissions associated  with their services."
10,Apple.pdf,8   We calculate “default utility emissions” to provide baseline emissions of what our carbon footprint would have been without the use of renewable energy.
10,Apple.pdf,This allows us to  demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program.
10,Apple.pdf,9   Apple’s greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,"10  We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar year basis, while the numbers reported in this table are based on fiscal year."
10,Apple.pdf,"Beginning  
11   Over the past few years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage."
10,Apple.pdf,"Beginning in FY2016, we started reporting this submetered  electricity usage."
10,Apple.pdf,"Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities."
10,Apple.pdf,We’ve updated our fiscal year  2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple’s operational boundaries.
10,Apple.pdf,"Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we’ve removed from our electricity usage  and scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations."
10,Apple.pdf,"Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s comprehensive fiber footprint data related to corporate  fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,"This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting  product and packaging related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the  calculated corporate annual fiber footprint of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2020  and of corporate and retail operations in the same period."
10,Apple.pdf,As there is no standardised method available for calculating a product or company fiber  footprint Apple defined a methodology for internal use.
10,Apple.pdf,"The scope of the Fiber Footprint  includes Apple’s corporate fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations."
10,Apple.pdf,"The  fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood, bamboo, and bagasse fiber, both virgin  and recycled, that Apple uses in packaging, and other paper products."
10,Apple.pdf,Apple obtains and  analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and sums up these figures for the  entire company using sell-in numbers.
10,Apple.pdf,"For some products, a representative supplier is  chosen to calculate the product-specifc packaging."
10,Apple.pdf,The output is a total fiber footprint.
10,Apple.pdf, The system boundaries are clearly defined   Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate   Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately  disclosed
10,Apple.pdf," Calculation methodology for the corporate fiber footprint   Sales data for FY2020, including accessories   Aggregated fiber data for all products and the total corporate fiber footprint for  the fiscal year 2020  
The methodology paper (Fiber Footprint at Apple - Methodology Description - V1.1)  provided by Apple and reviewed in 2017, is considered a sound and appropriate guidance  for determining the company fiber footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"Where appropriate, this approach follows  methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments."
10,Apple.pdf,"This review comprises a check of packaging fiber data for selected products (iPhone 11,  iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad 2019)."
10,Apple.pdf,Plausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail.
10,Apple.pdf,No  corrections were needed.
10,Apple.pdf,This review was done remotely.
10,Apple.pdf,All questions raised in the course  of the review were answered by Apple.
10,Apple.pdf,"Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate  fiber footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of fiber data and  information."

10,Apple.pdf,Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple’s scope 3 carbon footprint data related to the products  manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. in fiscal year 2020.
10,Apple.pdf,"This review checks transparency of data and calculations, appropriateness of supporting  product related data and assumptions, and overall plausibility of the calculated  comprehensive annual carbon footprint comprised of emissions derived from the life cycle  assessment (LCA) of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2020."
10,Apple.pdf,This review and verification  focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by  WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol – Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard).
10,Apple.pdf,It is  noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1  and 2 emissions) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a  separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this  statement.
10,Apple.pdf,Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded  from the scope of this verification.
10,Apple.pdf,This review and verification covers Apple’s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not  replace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions  (GHGs).
10,Apple.pdf,The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been  calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management –  Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines.
10,Apple.pdf,This  review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases – Part 3:  Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.
10,Apple.pdf,These criteria are also fundamental to the review of LCAs conducted for individual product  emissions.
10,Apple.pdf,The reviewers note that the largest share (98%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon
10,Apple.pdf,footprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from individual products.
10,Apple.pdf,The aforementioned  criteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to  providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and  refinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.
10,Apple.pdf,"Including a reported value of 0.33 million metric tons CO2e for facilities (out of scope of  this verification), total comprehensive carbon footprint is reported to be 22.59 million  metric tons CO2e."
10,Apple.pdf,"Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint includes an increasing amount of greenhouse gas  emissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects,  supplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations."
10,Apple.pdf,These reductions are part of Apple’s Clean Energy Program.
10,Apple.pdf,Fraunhofer IZM has not  verified these emissions reductions.
10,Apple.pdf,"Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the Greenhouse  Gas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint  
 is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of GHG data and  information, and  
 has not been prepared in accordance with the related International Standard on  GHG quantification, monitoring and reporting."

10,Apple.pdf,"This review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall  carbon footprint."
10,Apple.pdf,"The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions:  
 Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of  methodological changes as indicated by Apple?"
10,Apple.pdf,In FY2020 and beginning of FY2021 4 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed  successfully against ISO 14040/44.
10,Apple.pdf,"These LCAs cover product segments iPhone, MacBook  Pro, iMac, and Apple Watch."
10,Apple.pdf,These recently reviewed LCA studies cover products which  represent in total 9.7% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,"Representatives of other  product segments (iPad, iPod, Mac Pro, MacBook Air, HomePod, AirPort Express / AirPort  Extreme, Apple TV, Airpods and Beats products) underwent no or only minor design  changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years."
10,Apple.pdf,All  reviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 74.5% of the total scope 3 carbon footprint.
10,Apple.pdf,All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related  evidence was provided where needed.
10,Apple.pdf,Apple’s assessment approach is excellent in terms of granularity of the used calculation  data.
10,Apple.pdf,A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from  Apple’s suppliers.
10,Apple.pdf,"For all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst- case approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative  estimates."
10,Apple.pdf,The review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data  level that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint has been materially misstated.
10,Apple.pdf,The excellent  analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.

11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The cloud forest of the Sierra de las Minas mountains  of Eastern Guatemala serves as the primary source  of water for thousands of people who live and work  in communities that are located in the Pasabien and  Teculutan watersheds.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"The rivers that flow down the  mountainside once provided a plentiful supply of water  for human consumption, agriculture and business."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"However, deforestation, intensive agriculture and   human encroachment into the area—combined with  a changing climate—degraded the natural ecosystem  of these watersheds."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"This led to droughts, forest  fires, polluted water sources and crop failure, with  dire consequences for both nature and people: loss  of biodiversity, respiratory problems from smoke and  increased competition for scarce resources."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In response, more than a decade ago, WWF and the  Fundación Defensores de la Naturaleza launched  an integrated watershed management project that  simultaneously addressed the interconnected issues of  climate, water and agriculture."

11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"More sustainable farming practices lead to improved  farm incomes, through higher crop yields, better  management, reduced costs and increased resilience   to changing weather patterns—as well as enhanced  product quality and a more stable supply."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The PSA are designed to encourage continuous  improvement of farming practices.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Recognizing the  diversity of supply chains, farm structures and risk  contexts, the PSA introduced a new framework for  evaluating compliance and performance of our supply  farm base to reflect the on-the-ground realities in  sustainable farming practices."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"The PSA’s “Leader/Mover/Improver” framework helps us  to catalog our ingredient supply into three performance  categories so we can prioritize our actions in line  with our company’s highest sustainability priorities,  including climate change, water resources, ecosystems  and biodiversity, human rights, and animal health and  welfare."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"These categories are: 
LEADER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume  is verified to a TCCC approved, third-party validation  aligned with the PSA.1 
MOVER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume  is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming  standard(s), effectively identifying and addressing key  sustainability issues and advancing sustainable practices."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"IMPROVER LEVEL, which applies when the supply  volume is sourced from smallholder/small-scale  producers participating in a support program and  continuously improving practices to address their priority  sustainability issues over time."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We are currently in the process of mapping the volume of  the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against this  framework.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,This mapping will form the basis for how we  engage with suppliers to drive continuous improvement  in line with our Leader-Mover-Improver framework.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"•  All of our agricultural-based suppliers will demonstrate  continuous improvement and will be categorized by  The Coca-Cola Company as either Leaders, Movers or  Improvers."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,•  All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and   their farm supply base will achieve “Leader” status  over time.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"1   These approved standards, which can be found on our website,  currently include Bonsucro for sugar; the Sustainable Agriculture  Initiative Platform—Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) for crops  including cane sugar, beet sugar and fruit; the Round Table for  Responsible Soy for soybean; the Rainforest Alliance for coffee and  tea; the Forest Stewardship Council for pulp and paper; and Field  to Market for U.S. corn, among others."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,Certain third-party validation  programs under the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles  (SAGP)—our previous framework that was in effect from 2013 to  2020—are still in the process of being evaluated for use under the  PSA.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Once this benchmarking process has been completed, the list  of approved verifications will be updated."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We source a significant volume of oranges from  Florida—but in 2020, none of our supply had   been verified by an approved sustainable  agriculture program."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We approached the  Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform  (SAI Platform) and asked for their support to  engage Florida orange growers on the topic of  sustainability.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"The resulting project, known as the  Florida Orange Sustainability FSA Accelerator,  brought together 14 companies aligned around  the same goal: to increase the volume of  sustainable oranges grown in Florida."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Together,  the SAI Platform created consensus across the  orange-processing industry, supporting growers  in implementing more sustainable practices— and communicating the sustainable practices  they were already employing."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Our volume of  sustainably sourced Florida oranges jumped  significantly, from 0% in 2020 to 41% in 2021, and  we expect the percentage to continue to grow."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In India, the majority of farmers are smallholders  who often lack the ability to verify their  production against global standards."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We have  been driving several initiatives to help small- scale sugar cane and fruit farmers improve  productivity, increase profitability and become  more resilient."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The sustainable agriculture  project Meetha Sona Unnati began in 2016 with  investments in sugar cane farmers in the state  of Uttar Pradesh.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"It proved so successful that,  together with our partners, we expanded it to the  state of Karnataka."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Under the flagship program  Fruit Circular Economy we have extended these  projects for growers of mangoes, oranges, apples,  lychee and grapes—all crops that are important  to our beverage production."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"To date, these  programs have trained a combined total of more  than 150,000 farmers in sustainable agricultural  practices, including ultra-high-density plantation  and drip irrigation."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We track progress against our sustainable sourcing goal for 12 global priority ingredients (cane sugar, mango,  grape, orange, apple, corn, lemon, beet sugar, tea, pulp & paper, coffee and soybean), which represent about   80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In 2021, following the launch of our PSA, we  benchmarked over 500 suppliers in more than 115 countries and territories to begin mapping our global priority  ingredient volumes against this new framework and establish a baseline."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"58% of our priority ingredient volumes  were sourced sustainably from suppliers using third-party validation programs already approved under the   PSA, effective 2021."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"This means they met the ""Leader"" level in our PSA framework."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We have made significant  progress with our suppliers to validate or verify the farms where our ingredients are grown.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We recognize,  however, that sustainable agriculture is not a fixed destination but a long-term process that requires ongoing  engagement between our business and our supply chains."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In 2016 and 2017, The Nature Conservancy (TNC)  and The Coca-Cola Company partnered with  producers in the Big Pine Creek watershed in  Indiana to establish cover crops on 2,660 acres  of farmland.1 Producers planted a cereal rye cover  crop outside the growing season of the main  crops of corn and soybean, which are planted in  rotation."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"When planted over several years, cover  crops improve the overall health and water- holding capacity of soils,2 sequester carbon and  reduce soil erosion and runoff.3 Following this  initial investment and support, many farmers have  continued to plant cover crops each year using  their own funds."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In 2021, out of the original 2,660  acres that were supported, a total of 1,264 acres  of cover crops were planted.1 The total estimated  decrease in runoff associated with the planting of  these cover crops is 484 million liters per year.4  The decrease in sediment erosion is estimated at  2,001 metric tons per year.4 
Smallholder farmers often face major challenges  in having their production validated by a third  party."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"So in 2019, we launched the “Fruto  Resiliente” project with a goal of improving  the farming practices of 480 smallholder  orange growers in the Brazilian citrus belt by  the end of 2023, with at least 50% of them  reaching the equivalent of bronze level of the  SAI FSA standard."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"The project is a collaborative  partnership between The Coca-Cola Company,  The Coca-Cola Foundation, innocent, Solidaridad,  Cutrale (our largest orange juice supplier in Brazil),  and Eckes Granini (a leading supplier of fruit juices  and beverages)."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As of December 2021, the project  had reached 800 orange growers through the  dissemination of information using digital tools  such as messaging apps, videos and live streams,  and a website where farmers can download  training manuals, booklets, etc."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"The project also  included more than 300 visits by agriculture  extension workers, who provide advisory services  to farms and tailored action plans, and a signed  partnership agreement with the Sylvio Moreira  Citriculture Center (CCSM) of the Campinas  Agronomic Institute (IAC)."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The project will utilize  CCSM/IAC's demonstration farm to showcase   and demonstrate sustainable agricultural  practices to farmers.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The project’s goal for 2022  is to improve the agricultural practices of at   least 200 orange farmers.

11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"By restoring and rebuilding degraded soils,  regenerative agricultural practices can conserve  and rehabilitate farmland, increase biodiversity  and yield, build resilience to climate change  and improve the water cycle."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Many of our water  replenishment programs promote regenerative  farming practices such as no-till/reduced/ conservation tillage, precision agriculture, edge  of field practices, crop rotations, the use of cover  crops and efficient use of fertilizers/compost."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In Turkey, for example, we have been working  in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture  and Forestry General Directorate of Agricultural  Reform and the Nature Conservation Centre to  introduce regenerative agricultural practices in  Konya province."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Begun in 2013 on 125 hectares,  the project expanded these practices to more  than 3,500 hectares of farmland."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Regenerative  agricultural practices have resulted in an  estimated increase in soil organic matter of at  least 30%, an increase in soil moisture content of  10%, and a reduction in required irrigation of 10%  during the growing season."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As a founding member of the SAI Platform's  Regenerative Agricultural Programme,  which aims to set an industry benchmark  for measuring outcomes at the farm level,  we are collaborating pre-competitively with  industry peers and suppliers to promote and  implement regenerative agricultural practices,  by supporting the development of tools and  guidance documents to build farmer capacity."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We also continue to be actively involved with  SAI Platform’s work on Farm Sustainability  Assessment (FSA), which helps drive relevant  and demonstrable continuous improvement of  on-farm environmental, social and economic  performance through supply chain collaboration  and fostering a common understanding of  sustainable agriculture."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"To make the biggest impacts, we aim to collaborate   with suppliers to engage the farmers in their supply  chains to help them improve performance."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,This is  because The Coca-Cola Company buys our ingredients  from suppliers that purchase agricultural raw materials  directly from farms or through intermediaries.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"All agricultural-based ingredient and packaging suppliers  are informed of our PSA, with clear expectations on  making measurable progress in meeting our PSA (on the  farms where raw materials for our products are grown),  set out through sourcing contracts and other supplier  communications."

11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"•  Training and extension services to farmers to  implement more sustainable practices that enhance  quality, productivity and farmer incomes."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In addition, suppliers of global priority ingredients   are required to provide annual letters of attestation  detailing the percentage of volume of ingredients sold   to us that comply with our PSA."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,These letters must  specify countries of origin and the relevant verifications   and standards that have been met.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As much as 60% of the sugar produced in China  comes from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region (Guangxi), in an area that suffers from  both droughts and floods."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"To help address this  challenge, we have been working with The Coca- Cola Foundation, the United Nations Development  Program (UNDP) and the China International  Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges  (CICETE) over the last decade to help increase  the production of sugar cane while reducing  water use."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,This has been done by promoting  drip irrigation systems and the use of treated  wastewater from nearby sugar mills for irrigation.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The project is a great example of scaling up: it  started with direct support by project partners  on ~200 hectares in 2011-2013.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Through the  demonstration of the benefits of taking this new  sustainable agriculture approach, the Chinese  local government supported the project’s  replication and expansion to an additional 6,500  hectares in 2013 before leading to a full-scale  rollout across the entire sugar cane sector in  Guangxi."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As of January 2021, a total of ~350,000  hectares have benefited from agricultural  practices piloted by the program, both in Guangxi  and neighboring provinces."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,Our comprehensive enterprise Water Footprint  assessment showed that 73% of our company’s total  water footprint and 92% of our freshwater footprint  is from growing the ingredients needed for our  beverages.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We have, therefore, integrated ingredient  sourcing into our water security vision by unifying our  water and sustainable agriculture strategies."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As we explore ways to address water use in our  agriculture supply chain, we are focusing on two main  tracks, similar to the approach we have taken for  operational water use in our production facilities:   
•  Actions we take to promote advanced water  management practices for our global priority  ingredients grown in water-stressed regions."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,•  Actions we take to improve overall watershed  health in priority sourcing regions where our global  priority ingredients are grown.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In 2021 we began developing a Water-Agriculture  guidebook to outline a prioritization framework  of global priority agricultural ingredients with the  highest water dependency and risk, priority sourcing  watersheds and relevant suppliers."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,The guidebook  will provide a system-wide action plan that aligns  with the PSA and our water security goal.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Our people and culture initiatives are critical business priorities, and we  strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and retains high- performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our  journey to refresh the world and make a difference."

11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We are committed to caring for those who make our success possible,  whether through respecting human rights across our operations and  supply chain, empowering access to equal opportunities, supporting more  sustainable agriculture practices, or giving back to communities through  our philanthropic initiatives."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"The Coca-Cola Company’s policies and practices are aligned with the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which we have  supported since their inception in 2011."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We work to embed respect for human rights across our system through a comprehensive framework of  policies, stakeholder engagement, due diligence and remediation."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"In line with the UN Guiding Principles, we carry out  human rights due diligence across our value chain."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We  regularly assess our key human rights risks and ensure  that we are taking steps to identify and address them.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"We maintain an industry-leading global audit program  of our own operations, as well as those of our bottling  partners and Tier 1 suppliers, with over 38,000 human  rights assessments conducted since 2003."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We audit  facilities using the same protocol in every market where  our system and suppliers operate.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As of the end of 2021,  95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and  92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous  SGP protocols."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,These audit results are reviewed by  the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of  Directors on an annual basis.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"Despite falling short of our  ambitious goals due to the impact of COVID-19, these  results show remarkable improvement across our value  chain."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We will continue to advance our human rights  strategy and work.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,We have also worked to extend our supplier due  diligence beyond Tier 1.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"For instance, we collaborate  with our Tier 1 ingredient suppliers to drive respect for  human rights within their supply chain at the farm-level  through our PSA program."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,And we have developed a  due diligence module specifically tailored to the unique  challenges of the informal waste collection sector and  our World Without Waste initiative.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,More information on  our due diligence program can be found in our Human  Rights 2022 Overview.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,Our Human Rights Policy captures the company’s  overall commitment to human rights.

11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"As many replenish projects are co-financed with partners, TCCC claims the portion of the total water  benefits equivalent to the company’s cost share for the project."
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,TCCC also claims the annual water benefits from each project following a benefit duration framework of up to 15 years as long as   the projects remain in productive service; benefits of reforestation and land conservation projects may be claimed for up to 20 years with documentation that ecosystem services and biodiversity   are being achieved.
11,Coca-Cola.pdf,"For individual projects with benefits greater than 5% of global sales volume, benefit caps are unchanged from 2020, which are based on 5% of global sales volume or 100% of the business unit sales  volume, whichever is greater."

13,Exxon.pdf,"ExxonMobil is taking action to help address plastic waste in the environment by increasing plastic recyclability  and supporting improvements in plastic waste recovery, for example, through our founding membership  in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste."
13,Exxon.pdf,We are also working on advanced recycling solutions that create and  capture value from plastic waste with opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the full  life cycle of the plastic.
13,Exxon.pdf,"In addition, minimizing pellet loss from our operations is integral to our commitment  to responsible operations."
13,Exxon.pdf,"ExxonMobil is creating innovative products that help society reduce plastic waste by meeting consumers’  performance needs with less material, developing new materials for packaging that is more easily  recycled, and enabling customers to increase their recycled content."
13,Exxon.pdf,"For example, our VistamaxxTM  performance polymers increase our customers’ ability to use recycled materials, while also improving  toughness and tear resistance."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Our products can be used to make full polyethylene laminated pouches  that are more easily recyclable and can replace difficult-to-recycle conventional multilayer packaging in  non-food applications such as detergents and dishwasher pods, while retaining packaging performance  benefits."
13,Exxon.pdf,"And our performance polyethylene resins enable our customers to meet their performance  needs with thinner, lighter-weight products, which require less resource."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Plastics have value throughout their life cycle, including at the end of their life."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Both traditional and  advanced recycling processes are needed to help society maximize the value captured from plastic waste,  but there are some limitations with traditional recycling as currently configured."
13,Exxon.pdf,Traditional mechanical recycling – grinding discarded plastic and melting it together with new plastic – is  an efficient approach where waste is well sorted and for waste products that are made predominantly  from one type of plastic.
13,Exxon.pdf,"However, each time plastic is recycled via traditional processes, it loses some  of its performance benefits."
13,Exxon.pdf,"In addition, it is difficult to remove contaminants from traditional recycling  processes, an important consideration for food and health care applications."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Our employees monitor the production, loading and storage of plastic  pellets at all our resin-handling facilities to minimize plastic pellet loss."
13,Exxon.pdf,Advanced recycling involves breaking down plastic waste into its molecular building blocks.
13,Exxon.pdf,This approach  effectively transforms plastic waste into the raw materials that are used in the process of making   virgin-quality plastic and other valuable products.
13,Exxon.pdf,"ExxonMobil believes advanced recycling is a necessary  complement to traditional recycling for several reasons: 
•  Advanced recycling enables society to capture more value from a broader range of products and  provides more flexibility in sorting and separation processes."
13,Exxon.pdf,•  There are no evident technical limitations regarding how many times a plastic product can be put  through these processes.
13,Exxon.pdf,•  Advanced recycling helps remove contaminants from used plastic.
13,Exxon.pdf,•  Advanced recycling provides opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the   full life cycle of the plastic.
13,Exxon.pdf,ExxonMobil is working on technology to help enable and accelerate large-scale advanced recycling  solutions that could address certain limitations of traditional recycling and do so in an economically  feasible way.
13,Exxon.pdf,"Leveraging our expertise in research and development and molecule management, we  are developing options for integrating advanced recycling solutions at our petrochemical facilities."
13,Exxon.pdf,"We  expect this will lead to more mixed and soiled plastic waste being recovered and used to make high- value raw materials safely, reliably and economically, at scale."
13,Exxon.pdf,We are doing this without diminishing our  commitment to developing products that are easier to recycle via traditional recycling methods.
13,Exxon.pdf,"As economies grow, society’s commitment to waste management systems must expand to enable  the appropriate collection, sorting and processing of waste to minimize environmental impact."
13,Exxon.pdf,"These  infrastructure enhancements are needed for all types of municipal solid waste, not just plastic."
13,Exxon.pdf,"However,  increasing plastic recycling rates and converting plastic waste into a broad range of valuable products  could unlock value and help offset some of the costs of improvements to waste collection and   sorting infrastructure."
13,Exxon.pdf,"While ExxonMobil agrees there is no place for plastic waste in the environment,  the environmental benefits of plastic are clear."
13,Exxon.pdf,Calls to replace plastic packaging  with alternative materials can often have unintended negative environmental  impacts.
13,Exxon.pdf,"For example: 
According to a 2011 U.K."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Environment Agency study, a cotton tote bag   would need to be used 131 times to have a lower full life cycle emissions   impact than using a typical plastic grocery bag once."
13,Exxon.pdf,A 2016 TruCost study found that substituting plastic in consumer products  packaging with alternatives that perform the same function would have nearly  four times the negative impact on the environment on a full life cycle basis.
13,Exxon.pdf,A 2018 study by the Denmark Ministry of Environment and Food concluded a  paper bag would need to be reused 43 times to have a lower impact on ozone  depletion and air and water pollution than the average plastic bag.
13,Exxon.pdf,A 2018 Franklin Associates study in the United States found the  manufacturing process for plastics packaging used almost 50 percent less  energy and 80 percent less water compared to the manufacturing process   for alternate materials.
13,Exxon.pdf,"ExxonMobil was the first energy company to join The Recycling  Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing  recycling in the United States."
13,Exxon.pdf,We have committed $1.5 million  to this organization to help develop sustainable solutions and  support activities such as curbside recycling programs.
13,Exxon.pdf,"The  partnership has supported more than 1,000 communities,  including 50 million homes, and has diverted 233 million pounds  of recyclable waste from landfills to recycling centers."
13,Exxon.pdf,"In 2019, ExxonMobil helped launch the Alliance to End Plastic  Waste as a founding member."
13,Exxon.pdf,We worked with companies from  multiple sectors to form the world’s most significant organization  of business and nonprofit partners to help address plastic waste.
13,Exxon.pdf,"The membership has since grown to nearly 50 organizations that  have collectively committed more than $1 billion to develop safe,  scalable and economically viable solutions."
13,Exxon.pdf,"The Alliance aims to  accelerate additional investment by proving the effectiveness of  these solutions, particularly in countries with the highest levels  of plastic waste in the environment."
13,Exxon.pdf,"For more information about  the Alliance’s projects, please visit endplasticwaste.org."
13,Exxon.pdf,"In both 2018 and 2019, ExxonMobil had no reportable plastic  pellet losses."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Although laws and regulations related to the  reporting of plastic pellet loss to the environment vary by  jurisdiction, we put in place a global standard across all of our  resin-handling facilities."
13,Exxon.pdf,ExxonMobil’s objective is to have zero  pellet loss to the environment.
13,Exxon.pdf,"ExxonMobil is a founding member of the  Alliance to End Plastic Waste, an organization  committed to advancing potential scalable  solutions to reduce plastic waste in   the environment."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Although laws and regulations related to  the reporting of plastic pellet loss to the  environment vary by jurisdiction, we put in   place a global standard across all of our   resin-handling facilities."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Pellets are typically loaded into a bag, truck or railcar via a  mechanical process."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Plant personnel monitor our facilities via  routine daily rounds, and if a loss of containment is discovered,  loose pellets are promptly recovered."
13,Exxon.pdf,"Pellet recovery  equipment, such as skimmers and sieves, is also in place to  recover pellets captured in our water drainage systems."
13,Exxon.pdf,ExxonMobil actively participates in industry initiatives related to  pellet loss.
13,Exxon.pdf,"Since 2008, we have been a member of Operation  Clean Sweep, a voluntary international industry program for  plastic manufacturing facilities that encourages the use of best  practices for pellet management and containment to reduce  pellet loss."
13,Exxon.pdf,"We have incorporated Operation Clean Sweep  principles into our global Operations Integrity Management  System, which is applied at our plastics production and  handling facilities around the world and requires a regular  assessment of our procedures to ensure they are effective,  and improvement measures are implemented if needed."
13,Exxon.pdf,"We  have also incorporated Operation Clean Sweep principles  into our Supplier Relationship Management process to inform  third-party logistics suppliers about our commitment, and we  encourage participation in similar programs or activities to  prevent pellet loss."
13,Exxon.pdf,"In 2019, we joined Operation Clean Sweep-Blue, which  is a voluntary extension of Operation Clean Sweep in the  United States that includes enhanced commitments for the  awareness, prevention, management and reporting of plastic  pellet releases to help further reduce plastic pellet loss at  industry facilities."
13,Exxon.pdf,ExxonMobil employees worked with strategic partners and contractors from around the world to build the   Floating Production Storage and Offloading platform (FPSO) Liza Destiny in Singapore and deliver it offshore Guyana.
13,Exxon.pdf,Safety is a core value at ExxonMobil.
13,Exxon.pdf,"We operate in a manner that helps protect our employees, contractors,  customers and the communities where we operate."

13,Exxon.pdf,"From a Lost-Time Incident Rate (LTIR) perspective, our workforce remains significantly safer than the industry   as a whole."
13,Exxon.pdf,"XTO Energy, our unconventional exploration and production unit, continued its year-on-year  improvement trend and achieved its best-ever LTIR results in 2019."
13,Exxon.pdf,Our Fuels & Lubricants and Chemical  businesses continue to outperform their respective industry benchmarks.
13,Exxon.pdf,"In 2019, we enhanced our focus on defining consistent Life Saving Actions, or safeguards, for higher-consequence  work associated with lifting and rigging, and with work around mobile equipment."
13,Exxon.pdf,These actions are applicable   to day-to-day activities where ExxonMobil and industry experience has shown tragic personnel safety outcomes  still occur.
13,Exxon.pdf,"ExxonMobil employees regularly attend specialized trainings, often  with local firefighters and other first responders, to help ensure  preparedness in case of an emergency."
13,Exxon.pdf,"We work with our employees and contractors to understand Life Saving Actions for these   higher-consequence activities and how to verify critical, effective safeguards are in place before   the work begins and during execution."

14,Amazon.pdf,This year-over-year carbon intensity comparison reflects  our early progress to decarbonize our operations as we also  continue to grow as a company.
14,Amazon.pdf,Nearly half of our carbon  intensity improvement is a result of our investments  in renewable energy and operational efficiency  enhancements.
14,Amazon.pdf,A third of this improvement reflects a shift  in customer and employee behavior due to the COVID-19  pandemic.
14,Amazon.pdf,"Customers made fewer trips to our Whole Foods  
Market stores and other  physical stores in 2020  and shifted to home delivery instead, which generates  lower carbon emissions."
14,Amazon.pdf,We also saw less business travel  and employee commuting as a result of many of our  employees working from home for most of the year.
14,Amazon.pdf,"We also saw a reduction in our carbon intensity at the  package fulfillment level, which measures the emissions  from our business activities to deliver packages to our  customers’ doorsteps."
14,Amazon.pdf,"This calculation—measured in grams  of CO2e per package delivered—includes the emissions  generated by our fulfillment operations where items are  picked off the shelf and packages are sorted, the well-to- wheel emissions across our transportation network, and  the lifecycle emissions of the packaging we use to protect  items during transit."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Similar to our overall carbon intensity  improvement, this reduction was driven by a combination  of our investments in renewable energy to power our  fulfillment facilities, efficiencies in our transportation  network to deliver packages, and reductions in the  packaging materials we use for each package."
14,Amazon.pdf,It will take several years for the carbon reduction benefits of  our investments to be fully reflected in our footprint.
14,Amazon.pdf,"While  we are still in the early phase of decarbonizing our business,  we are pleased to see meaningful progress in several areas."
14,Amazon.pdf,"We will continue to rapidly scale our investments in carbon  reduction solutions that have large, long-term impacts that  will move us forward on our path to net-zero carbon by  2040."

14,Amazon.pdf,"We know that by working together, we  can raise the bar for data centers and help support the goals of  the European Green Deal."
14,Amazon.pdf,AWS has always been focused on improving efficiency in  every aspect of our infrastructure.
14,Amazon.pdf,"From the highly available  infrastructure that powers our servers, to techniques we  use to cool our data centers, and the innovative server  designs that deliver AWS services to our customers—energy  efficiency is a primary goal of our global infrastructure."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Through our scale and focus on innovation, we can achieve  higher resource utilization and energy efficiency than is  possible for the typical on-premises data center, and we are  continuously working on ways to do more."
14,Amazon.pdf,The results of a study by 451 Research show that AWS’s  infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the  median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed.
14,Amazon.pdf,More than  two-thirds of this advantage is attributable to the combination  of a more energy efficient server population and much higher  server utilization.
14,Amazon.pdf,AWS data centers are also more energy- efficient than enterprise sites due to comprehensive efficiency  programs that touch every facet of the facility.
14,Amazon.pdf,"For example, we have improved power efficiency and  availability by removing the central Uninterruptible Power  Supply (UPS) from our data center design and integrating  small battery packs and custom power supplies into our  racks."
14,Amazon.pdf,These changes combined reduce energy conversion  loss by about 35%.
14,Amazon.pdf,AWS also continues to increase the efficiency of the  custom hardware and software we design to deliver AWS  services.

14,Amazon.pdf,AWS has multiple initiatives underway to use water more  efficiently and use less potable (drinking) water to cool  our data centers.
14,Amazon.pdf,"AWS develops our water-use strategy  by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local  water management and availability, and the opportunity  to conserve drinking water sources."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Taking a holistic  approach, we assess both the water and energy usage  of each potential cooling solution to select the most  efficient method."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Evaporative Cooling 
When possible, AWS incorporates direct evaporative  technology to cool our data centers, reducing energy and  water consumption."
14,Amazon.pdf,"During cooler months, outside air is  supplied directly to the data center without using any water."
14,Amazon.pdf,"During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled  through an evaporative process using water before being  pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized these  cooling systems to minimize water usage."
14,Amazon.pdf,"AWS is constantly  innovating the design of our cooling systems to further  reduce water use, and we adapt to changing weather  conditions based on real-time sensor data."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Recycled Water 
To help conserve local drinking water sources, AWS is  expanding our use of non-potable water for cooling  purposes."
14,Amazon.pdf,"In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data  center operator to be approved to use recycled water with  direct evaporative cooling technology."
14,Amazon.pdf,"We partnered with  Loudoun Water to demonstrate the benefits of recycled  water for industrial cooling applications and shared our  operational best practices for using recycled water in our  
data centers."

14,Amazon.pdf,"We are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility  water meters, and we are also installing our own meters to  track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for  our operations and sustainability teams."
14,Amazon.pdf,"By analyzing this  data, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage  and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting  for bills or usage reports."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Along with reducing our water usage, AWS looks for  opportunities to return water to the community."
14,Amazon.pdf,"In our  U.S. West (Oregon) Region, for example, we partnered  with the City of Umatilla and the West Extension Irrigation  District to deliver water to farmers."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Since our cooling  water is not dirty, instead of sending it to a wastewater  treatment plant, we deliver it to the local community to  be repurposed for irrigation."
14,Amazon.pdf,"In our U.S. West (Oregon)  Region, we reuse 96% of cooling water generated from  our data centers."
14,Amazon.pdf,AWS is also working on community water programs all  around the world.
14,Amazon.pdf,"We are partnering with Water.org and  WaterAid in India and Indonesia, where water filtration  plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and groundwater  recharge projects will bring a combined 250 million  gallons of water per year to 165,000 people."
14,Amazon.pdf,We are also  funding watershed restoration efforts with The Nature  Conservancy in Cape Town and São Paulo that will  increase water supply availability by 41 million gallons   per year.
14,Amazon.pdf,Shifting to renewable energy has environmental benefits  beyond lowering carbon emissions.
14,Amazon.pdf,"According to the  International Energy Agency, the energy sector is responsible for  10% of global water withdrawals, used for operating thermal  power plants and producing fuels."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Unlike thermal power plants,  wind and solar plants do not require large amounts of water  to operate."
14,Amazon.pdf,"In 2020, ’s renewable energy generation  helped to avoid the withdrawal of about 480 billion liters of  water—enough to supply 1 million American households or fill  up 190,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools each year."

14,Amazon.pdf,"Recycling in Our Operations 
 is reducing the operational waste associated with  customer fulfillment in facilities across the globe."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Corrugated  board is the most common material that flows through  our operations, and we work with third-party recycling  haulers to remove corrugated board from our facilities  for off-site recycling."
14,Amazon.pdf,"Many of these recycling haulers also  supply  with the packaging materials that we use for  customer shipments, converting waste material recovered  from  operations into new, recycled packaging."
14,Amazon.pdf,Not all of the materials we use can be easily recycled using  current available systems.
14,Amazon.pdf,"Plastic film, for example, is a  difficult material to process, and most municipal recycling  programs do not accept it."
14,Amazon.pdf,"In order to innovate and solve  for this gap,  has developed a process for on-site  plastic film recycling for our operations."
14,Amazon.pdf,"In 2020, we began  converting plastic film into poly bags made of 100%  recycled material, which are used for package-free returns  at  drop-off locations in the U.S. After use, the  bags are collected and returned to  facilities where  we again convert them into new poly bags, repeating the  recycling process."
14,Amazon.pdf,"As of June 2021, on-site plastic film  recycling is available at more than 168  sites across  North America and Europe."
14,Amazon.pdf,We are also exploring alternative solutions for less common  materials that cannot be recycled.
14,Amazon.pdf,"In several European  locations, we work with our shipping label suppliers to  recycle the silicone backing paper from used shipping  labels into new label components."
